1284,I applied for around 90 jobs': unemployed and furloughed in a pandemic,10/29/20,"Hundreds of thousands of people in the UK have lost their jobs as the coronavirus pandemic pushes the rate of redundancies to record highs, and the number is expected to increase when the furlough scheme comes to an end this week. According to a new report, young people and those from ethnic minority backgrounds are disproportionately impacted by the redundancies, while many recent graduates are struggling to find employment. The Guardian spoke to some of those who have been affected by the upheaval in the jobs market.
‘You cannot sleep at night’ Roman Cristinel, 36, chef, London Chef Roman Cristinel was furloughed from his job at a central London hotel in March, and found out he was being made redundant at the start of this month. “It was horrible. You cannot sleep at night and you have chest pain,” he said. “It’s very unpleasant not being sure what you’re going to do next month, or if you’re going to be able to provide food for your family. I’m applying for jobs, but nobody is responding.” Cristinel estimates he has applied for 20 jobs since the start of October, but is concerned that hospitality roles are becoming scarce. He has applied for universal credit to help him pay his rent. “This is what I do and what I’ve been doing for a long time,” he said. “I have no experience doing different stuff. I’ve even applied for cleaning jobs, kitchen porter roles, and other things. But when you’re applying, there’s a few hundred people who have applied. “There’s a constant fear of what’s going to happen next, but you have to be positive and keep strong. Because if you let it, it destroys you.” ‘I might as well have paused my life’ Craig Wood, 31, construction worker, West Midlands “I feel like I’m back to square one,” said Craig Wood, who was made redundant in June after being furloughed. Three years ago, Wood retrained from his job in security to enter the construction industry, working a minimum wage job on a training course and attending college one day a week. “I worked my way up to a decent job and a decent salary, but I’ve got nothing now. It feels like I might as well have paused my life for three years. It was a waste of time,” he said. Wood has applied for around 60 jobs since he was made redundant, and has not received a single response. “I don’t really want to start working in warehouses overnight,” he said. “I’m not above doing it, but I don’t want to start on a minimum wage job after working my way up. There are people worse off but it’s been horrible.” ‘There’s no money for emergencies’ Melanie Hill, 50, telesales worker, Rhondda, south Wales In Rhondda, south Wales, Melanie Hill is unsure whether she will have a job to return to when furlough ends. “There are a lot of people out of work and I worry about the future,” she said. Hill works part-time in a telesales role for a small business and is a single mother to two sons, aged nine and 11. She has been furloughed since March, taking home £660 a month. “It’s hard enough to live on what I earn normally,” she said. “We forage for things and Lidl has a bargain box of vegetables available early in the morning which I try and buy, but there’s no money for emergencies or treats for the children.” Hill feels “betrayed” by the government and feels more support is needed: “People will only put up with hunger and isolation for so long and all of this is disproportionately affecting ordinary people. “It’s a bit like people pushing a car up a hill. It’s fine when everyone’s helping but over time one by one they drop out and you’re left on your own. It’s a real struggle.” ‘Applying for work is like a full-time job’ Raabia Butt, 21, law graduate, London Many recent graduates have struggled to find a job as a result of the pandemic. One of those is law graduate Raabia Butt, who lives in London. “Me and my friends almost wish we were still in university, and not having to face what’s happening,” said Butt. “We wanted to stay under the cover of education.” Since she graduated in June, Butt has completed more than 200 applications. She has been invited to five interviews, but has been unable to secure a job. “At first I was quite strategic, applying for things that I’d like to do, but now I’m applying for anything. It’s like a full-time job,” she said. “At home I live with three other people with jobs, and it’s demoralising. I’m starting to realise it’s looking quite dim for employment, and I’m thinking about a masters to refine my skills to help.”
‘It was devastating’ Phoebe Rodwell, 23, Manchester Phoebe Rodwell was furloughed and later made redundant from her job in the events industry. “It was awful, I felt like I’d spent a long time getting into a career I really want to do,” she said. “My boss said that if they could keep me on, they would. I understood, but it was devastating. “I applied for around 90 jobs, had two rejections and no other responses. I thought, I just can’t keep doing this, so decided I’d apply for university.” Now Rodwell is at the University of Salford studying criminology and counselling, and hopes to do freelance work in the events sector. “At the end of my three years, either I’ve kept my foot in the door enough with festivals to go back to that, or I completely change industry,” she said. “I chose my degree because it was interesting, but also a solid back-up so I can go and work in a different sector, because I don’t feel safe any more.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1285,What made him come there?': Lukashenko's surprise meeting with his critics,10/29/20,"The participants had printed name cards set out in front of them, there was a flower arrangement in the centre of the table, and the discussion topic was political reforms that might improve the country. There was one unusual detail about the discussion held in Minsk this month: 12 people around the table were political prisoners, and the 13th was Alexander Lukashenko, the man who had put them behind bars. Facing a broad, sustained protest against the continuation of his 26-year rule, Lukashenko had previously said he would not give up power “even if dead” and threatened his opponents with all manner of reprisals. Now, it seemed, he wanted to talk. Liliya Vlasova, a 67-year-old lawyer and mediator who was arrested on tax evasion charges in late August, soon after being elected to the leadership body of an opposition council seeking a transfer of power, could not believe her eyes when she saw the familiar face. “I thought it was a body double at first – I didn’t think it was possible. But after five minutes I realised it was the real Lukashenko,” she said. She had been woken in her cell at 6am, driven to KGB headquarters and held in an office there for four hours. Eventually she was led to a room where she saw other political prisoners including Viktor Babariko and Sergei Tikhanovsky, who had wanted to run in the August presidential election but were jailed. The group greeted each other and wondered out loud what the occasion for the strange gathering could possibly be. Perhaps, someone suggested, they would be forced to make televised confessions. Then Lukashenko walked in. The next four and a half hours were “more of a monologue” than a dialogue, said Vlasova, though there was a heated and angry exchange between Tikhanovsky and Lukashenko. The prisoner was furious about his detention, while Lukashenko was offended that Tikhanovsky had called him a “cockroach” in YouTube videos this year. There was no water to drink and no option to use the toilet. “What made him come there? I still don’t understand,” said Vlasova. Western diplomats were also surprised by the move, with some wondering whether Lukashenko’s backers in Moscow, alarmed at the level of discontent, had demanded he try to reach out to the opposition and reach some kind of compromise. “Lukashenko told us he wants dialogue on constitutional reform, and he promised that this would be his last term in office,” said Yuri Voskresensky, a businessman and political scientist who was part of the Babariko campaign. “I was sitting next to him and my intuition was that he was telling the truth.”
Voskresensky was released soon after the meeting and tasked by Lukashenko with serving as an intermediary between the two sides, though charges of organising mass disturbances are still hanging over him. He said Lukashenko’s offer should be taken seriously, even if the optics of negotiating with your jailer were strange, and said he would hold a meeting next week of opposition supporters who want to take part in drafting ideas to present to Lukashenko. “We are not western Europe, where people were already democratic 500 years ago. I could be upset that I was kept in jail for two months, but we have the chance to democratise and we should take it,” he said. Few other opposition figures appear minded to go along with him, rubbishing the gambit as meaningless. After the violence and arrests of the past two months, they say, the only acceptable outcome now is a transfer of power. Vlasova was released a few days after the discussion, back to the comfort of her home, where the living room is filled with vases of flowers from wellwishers. Tax evasion charges against her and her son, which she described as “completely fabricated”, have not been dropped, and her son’s business has been destroyed. Although she was not subjected to physical violence, the six weeks she spent behind bars was trying in the extreme. She was held in a 10-person cell with no fresh air or daylight, with eight cellmates who frequently smoked. There were long interrogations, usually in the evening, and threats that if she did not confess she would be sent to sew army uniforms in prison. “I had panic attacks, I couldn’t sleep at night, my heart was seizing up from fear,” she said. Just at the moment when she had made peace with the fact that she could be in prison for years, the surprise discussion took place. Lukashenko came to the meeting with one aide and his teenage son Nikolai, who in the past has accompanied the president to meetings with world leaders, has appeared dressed in full military uniform, and was even seen brandishing a gun one Sunday in August when Lukashenko decided to fly over the protesters in a helicopter. Nikolai sat through the meeting silently, said Voskresensky, though at one point his father sent him to fetch aerial photographs of protests, which Lukashenko showed to those at the meeting to “prove” the small numbers of people involved. After the meeting, Tikhanovsky was allowed to speak to his wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, for the first time in more than four months. Tikhanovskaya ran in the election as a unified opposition candidate and fled to Lithuania after the vote, from where she has said she is ready to head a transitional government before new elections. She said after the call that she did not believe in “dialogue at gunpoint”, and promptly announced a “people’s ultimatum” demanding that Lukashenko leave by last Sunday. In the wake of the deadline passing, a new wave of protests and strikes has begun, prompting another crackdown that hardly suggests the regime is ready for real compromise. On Tuesday Lukashenko suggested students who were striking as a result of Tikhanovskaya’s ultimatum should be “sent to the street, or to the army”, while his interior minister, Yuri Karayev, said this week that the police were “at war” and should not hesitate to use violence against protesters.
“My work now is to make it clear to every local police officer that your life, the future of your children and the happiness of your wife depends on how quickly and decisively you grab your weapon and realise that you are being killed and you are still trying to use persuasion,” said Karayev, in a grim-faced and threatening video address that bore little resemblance to reality. In fact, almost all of the violence so far has come from the side of the authorities. Karayev was removed as interior minister on Thursday; it was unclear for what reason. Part of the problem is that Lukashenko, like many authoritarian leaders, appears to be fully convinced that without him the country would fall apart. “I built this country, and if I got something wrong, it’s because you people didn’t support me, you only criticised,” said Voskresensky, paraphrasing the president’s message at the KGB roundtable. “He is fully convinced that he is the messiah in this country, and that without him we would not exist,” said Vlasova. At the end of the meeting, Lukashenko thanked those present and said he would be happy to invite them to his palace “to continue the discussion”. The next day the men were taken to a bathhouse, where they were able to steam, chat and eat from a table laid with snacks. Then most of them went back to prison. Vlasova is now at liberty, but has a court case hanging over her. Her family are begging her to step away from active politics, and she is still recovering from her prison ordeal. “If I try to concentrate on anything, I either start crying or get headaches,” she said. On the other hand, her time in prison has made her more convinced of the need for political change. “I now have a clear understanding that our regime is not just authoritarian, it’s absolutely inhumane … The process of turning us into one big gulag is under way,” she said. This week she spent a day writing a letter to Maria Kolesnikova, a fellow member of the opposition’s coordination council and the most visible leader during the August protests. She remains in prison. Vlasova became teary as she described the contents of the letter. “I wrote that millions of people are fighting for her, that she’s the pride and strength of our country,” she said. “I told her she’s stronger than they are, and that eventually we will win.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1286,Antisemitism in Labour: what did the report find and what happens next?,10/29/20,"What is the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)? Often referred to as the UK’s human rights watchdog, it is an independent body with a unique set of legal powers to enforce equality laws, eliminate discrimination, reduce inequality and protect human rights. It was established in 2007 by a Labour government following a merger of the Commission for Racial Equality, the Disability Rights Commission and the Equal Opportunities Commission. Was the investigation into failings over antisemitism in the Labour party unusual? Yes. The EHRC has never before embarked upon a statutory inquiry into a major political party. Labour is only the second political party to be investigated by it: in 2009, the EHRC launched legal action against the British National party over concerns about ethnic restrictions on its membership. What were the terms of the inquiry into Labour and antisemitism? After receiving hundreds of complaints from Jewish party members alleging either antisemitism or a failure to investigate allegations on antisemitism, the EHRC launched an inquiry in May 2019.
It aimed to establish whether Labour had broken the law by failing to implement recommendations from Lady Royall, the home affairs select committee and the Chakrabarti report to stem antisemitism in the party; whether the rule book and the party’s investigatory and disciplinary processes enabled it to deal with complaints; and whether the party had responded properly to complaints of unlawful acts. How did the EHRC carry out the investigation? It received evidence from the Jewish Labour Movement, the Campaign Against Antisemitism, Jewish Voice for Labourand whistleblowers. EHRC investigators analysed a sample of 70 complaints of antisemitism made against Labour party members including 12 complaints put forward by the Labour party. Most of the sample of complaints related to conduct on social media, reflecting the predominance of that type of complaint overall. However, it also included conduct at meetings and events and comments made to the media. What did it conclude? The EHRC found that Labour was responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act (2010) relating to political interference in antisemitism complaints; a failure to provide adequate training to those handling antisemitism complaints; and harassment. The failure relating to political interference “mainly came from the opposition’s office”, the EHRC found, and this was “not a legitimate approach”. The interference applied to a third of the 70 case files reviewed. What is the reputation of the EHRC? The EHRC has been dogged by problems including internal rows and a lack of funds. Since David Cameron came to power in 2010, its budget has been cut from £63m to less than £17.4m. It has often been portrayed as toothless by equality campaigners, or a “politically correct” liberal institute by those on the right. It was recently criticised by the Muslim Council of Britain for failing to launch an inquiry into allegations of Islamophobia in the Conservative party. A report last year from the Commons women and equalities committee called on the EHRC to “overcome its timidity” and “refocus its work”. What happens next? The Labour party has been served with an unlawful act notice. It has until 10 December to draft an action plan to implement the recommendations, which is legally enforceable by a court if not fulfilled.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1287,Antisemitism report opens up Labour's fault line all over again | John Crace,10/29/20,"The report into antisemitism in the Labour party was more damning than expected. As well as finding the Labour leadership guilty of political interference in the handling of complaints, the Equality and Human Rights Commission found specific examples of harassment and discrimination. “But equally of concern,” it added, “was a lack of leadership within the Labour party on these issues, which is hard to reconcile with its stated commitment to a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism.” The EHRC concluded that the Labour party could have tackled antisemitism more effectively if the leadership had chosen to do so. Jeremy Corbyn’s almost instantaneous Facebook response was rather more expected. Much ado about nothing. After acknowledging there had been antisemitism in the Labour party, though no more than in society at large, and that one racist in the party was one too many, came the big “buts”. But he had been trying to deal with it, but was frustrated by party bureaucracy. But the problem had been grossly overstated by the media and opponents for political advantage. In fact it had been almost entirely down to the media falsely reporting true allegations that he had lost the last election. It was almost as if the only antisemitism he had witnessed during his time as party leader – not that he had personally witnessed any – had been a little, light recreational racism. You could feel the former Labour leader just itching to mention Boris Johnson’s comments on Muslim women looking like letterboxes and other examples of Tory Islamophobia. Hell, no one had ever done more to fight racism in all its forms than him, but no leader could be expected to keep tabs on everything at the same time as creating a new socialist utopia. Give him a break. Keir Starmer looked like a man under the cosh as he gave his own press conference. This was by far his worst day since he had become Labour leader. Dealing with Boris and the Tories was child’s play compared with this. In a short statement, Starmer said this was a day of shame for Labour. He unreservedly accepted all the EHRC findings and would implement them in full. It was what the Labour leader didn’t say that was causing him the most pain. Because what Starmer was doing his best to avoid was acknowledging that he had served in Corbyn’s shadow cabinet and had backed him at last December’s general election. All of which was, well, potentially embarrassing. He was more or less in the clear so far as the allegations made against the leader of the opposition’s office were concerned because everyone had always known that Corbyn never consulted Starmer on anything of any sensitivity or importance. But backing Corbyn to win the last election was rather more problematic, because Starmer couldn’t very well tell the truth and say that he had never shared his values and that the only reason he had pretended to do so was because he knew Corbyn was heading for a big defeat. And if every centrist MP had bailed out of the Labour party to join the doomed Change UK, then there would have been no one credible left to take over as leader when Corbyn was inevitably forced to stand down. In which case Labour would have been out of power for even longer. Those were the kind of personal moral compromises that every successful politician had to make but couldn’t be spoken out loud. Especially on a day when the morality of the Labour party itself was under the spotlight. So Starmer merely stared anxiously into the middle distance and sucked up Labour’s existential guilt while carefully sidestepping any complicity of his own. Naturally, most questions centred on what Starmer planned to do about Corbyn, and these too were treated with a similar level of evasion. These were matters, he insisted, that should be dealt with after a proper period of reflection and internal investigation. Except they couldn’t. Corbyn’s refusal to accept the EHRC report in full rather put paid to that, and so by lunchtime Starmer had been forced to withdraw the whip and suspend his predecessor from the party. If Change UK had won any seats, Corbyn would now have been free to sit next to all the MPs he had driven out of the party as an independent. Within an hour or so, Corbyn had upped the ante once more by posting on Twitter: “I will strongly contest the political intervention to suspend me,” while again insisting there wasn’t a racist bone in his body. He followed this up with a short broadcast clip, urging Labour members not to give up on the fight for social justice – and not to believe everything in the EHRC report. This was Starmer’s worst nightmare and he could only release another statement insisting the party was right to suspend Corbyn but that the investigation into his actions must be fully independent. At a time when Labour should be focused on the government’s incompetent handling of the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit, the party was tearing itself apart again. Momentum and other Corbyn supporters were treating their man as a saint, martyred in the pursuit of pure socialism, while the rest of the party was desperately trying to find a way to move on from an issue that had festered for years. Rather than being an end to the matter, the EHRC report had once again split the party on tribal lines. Boris must be unable to believe his luck.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1288,Attacks in France put Islamist extremism back in spotlight,10/29/20,"The “vision of horror” in Nice, as police described the scene of a fatal knife attack in a church on Thursday, is a serious challenge for Emmanuel Macron. The French president has promised a crackdown on Islamist extremism, including shutting down mosques and other organisations accused of fomenting radicalism and violence, and said France was engaged in an existential battle against radical Islamic ideologies and separatism. His hardline interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, has spoken of extremists as the enemy within. There was also a stabbing outside the French consulate in Saudi Arabia on Thursday and an incident in the French city of Avignon involving a man armed with a knife who tried to attack police. It follows the murder two weeks ago of a schoolteacher in Conflans on the outskirts of Paris after he had shown students a caricature of the prophet Muhammad, and the wounding of two people outside the former offices of Charlie Hebdo. The attacks are unlikely to be part of a concerted campaign organised by a major group but responses to each other – experts have noted how one attack will frequently trigger more, often with the same tactics – and to the febrile atmosphere created by the angry rhetoric of some leaders in the Muslim world in response to Macron’s reassertion of France’s secular principles. The violence will, however, undoubtedly please the leaders of Islamic State and al-Qaida, who continue to seek ways of remaining relevant in the rapidly evolving and competitive world of extremist groups by claiming to have at least inspired attacks in Europe. Officials say extremists in Europe currently work through loose networks, embedded “in a wider Muslim extremist milieu, which can act as a conduit towards terrorist engagement”. These networks are largely homegrown and without organisational links to groups such as al-Qaida or Isis. There have also been incidents of self-radicalisation of individuals or small groups, principally via the internet, without being part of wider networks. That less attention has been paid in the west to Islamic extremism recently is understandable. Deaths in Europe from all forms of terrorism fell by 70% last year, and western Europe recorded its lowest number of incidents since 2012. According to the latest Europol reports, there were 21 jihadist plots in the EU in 2019, compared with 24 and 33 in the two previous years. Of the 21, four failed, 14 were foiled and three were carried out. There has certainly been nothing recently to rival the horrors of 2015 and 2016, when assault rifles and a truck were used to kill hundreds of people in a series of attacks. That surge in violence was the result of a number of factors that converged at a specific moment: Islamic State’s rule over a swath of Iraq and Syria, its decision to target the west, its huge media output and establishment of camps to train some of the thousands of young men from Europe who travelled to take part in the conflict, the existence of a series of networks and capable senior militants linking France and Syria, and the failings of western European security services and policymakers. Most of these factors have gone – the EU reported only two attempts to travel to join jihadist terrorist groups thwarted by member states last year – but others still exist. Some are particularly evident in France, where there were more than 200 arrests for jihadist terrorism last year, half of the total in Europe, and 8,000 individuals are considered at risk of radicalisation.
One major issue, as everywhere, remains the pernicious role of social media. This has been clearly shown in investigations into the murder of the teacher in Conflans. The teenage killer came from 60 miles away, and his knowledge of the teacher’s actions was based on misleading clips circulated by angry parents and a mosque. A second is the prison population. Many of those detained for extremist offences in France have previous criminal records, and after the numerous arrests for extremism during the 2012-17 period, many of the less serious offenders are now coming up for release. French officials have identified the man responsible for the Nice attack as Brahim Aouissaoui, a 21-year-old Tunisian who had recently arrived in France from Italy, which he had reached by boat in late September. Both the Conflans murder and September’s Charlie Hebdo attack were committed by 18-year-old immigrants. Abdouallakh Anzorov was a Chechen who came to France at the age of six, probably from Moscow. Ali Hassan left Pakistan at 15 to be smuggled to Europe. Shuja Nawaz, a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council, said two factors were colliding to produce violence. “First, the conditions in the home countries like Pakistan that increasingly are becoming more Islamicised and anti-western through the influence of mullahs and populist governments, while their education systems crumble,” he said. “Second, in the western countries where migrants end up legally or illegally, there is a ghettoisation of Muslim immigrants, who turn to religion as a defence mechanism and rallying point.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1289,Basmati battle: Pakistan fights Indian bid for EU recognition of rice,10/29/20,"A new ingredient has been added to the boiling pot that is the relationship between India and Pakistan: basmati rice. Pakistan’s government has vowed to “vehemently” oppose an application by India for the long-grain aromatic rice to be recognised by the EU as being grown exclusively in specific regions of the Indian subcontinent. Since 2006, the EU has applied zero tariffs on rice imported into the bloc that has been authenticated by either Pakistani or Indian authorities as genuine basmati. About two-thirds of basmati imports to the EU are from India and the rest from its northern neighbour. The application by the Indian government for sole geographical indication (GI) status for its homegrown product has prompted alarm at the highest levels of government in Pakistan. “The special characteristic of basmati is grown and produced in all districts of the state of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, as well as in specific districts of western Uttar Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir,” the Indian application says. GI status is used to mark a product out to consumers as having “qualities, reputation or characteristics relating to its place of origin”. In Europe, products such as Parma ham, champagne and stilton cheese have such a status, allowing producers from the respective regions to charge higher prices. The price of Darjeeling tea soared after 2011 when the Indian state of West Bengal was given the exclusive right to carry the name on packets of its leaves. The granting of GI status solely to Indian basmati rice would be a hammer blow to Pakistani exporters. India’s application prompted an emergency meeting of Pakistan’s commerce secretary, the chair of the country’s intellectual property organisation, representatives of the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan, and senior legal advisers to the government. Abdul Razak Dawood, an adviser to Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, subsequently said the application would be “vehemently opposed”. A formal objection is expected before the EU’s December deadline. Pakistan’s exports of basmati rice to the EU have more than doubled in the last three years, from 120,000 metric tons in 2017 to 300,000 metric tons in 2019, according to the European commission. India’s exports of basmati rice have been shrinking owing to a failure of its producers to meet increasingly strict EU standards on the use of pesticides. A growing proportion of Indian basmati exports go to Iran, Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Middle East – a trend New Delhi wants to reverse. A spokesman for the European commission said: “The commission has published the application for registration of the name ‘basmati’ from India as a proposed protected geographical indication. This publication gives the opportunity for stakeholders to lodge oppositions for a three-month period. “This publication does not imply the registration of ‘basmati’ but is a step in the standard geographical indication registration procedure. The final decision on registration is only taken after the opposition phase has been completed. This allows the rights of all parties to be respected in the registration process. “If an opposition is received from any party, the commission will ensure it is examined in line with standing procedures, ensuring the rights of all parties are scrupulously respected.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1290,"Brexit talks making good progress, says Ursula Von der Leyen",10/29/20,"Trade and security negotiations between the UK and the EU are making good progress, Ursula von der Leyen has said in the most optimistic comments to date on the state of the Brexit talks. As the negotiations moved to Brussels after seven days in London, the European commission president said: “We’re making good progress but [there are] two critical issues: level playing field and the fisheries, [where] we would like to see more progress. “We are in very close contact on an hourly basis because the negotiations now have been intensified … There are 11 other fields of files that have to be negotiated.” her comments come after Downing Street said last week that the talks were over. The outstanding issues are the level of access to British waters the UK will provide to EU fishing fleets, fair competition rules for business, including rules on domestic subsidies, and the mechanism in the final treaty for resolving future disputes. Von der Leyen, who was speaking after a meeting with the Canadian prime minster, Justin Trudeau, said the negotiators would work deep into the issue of how to construct a dispute mechanism that would allow either side to suspend parts of the deal in the event of a clear breach of obligations. The European council president, Charles Michel, said the state of the talks would probably assessed next week with Brussels hoping to start the ratification process in mid-November. The comments will be warmly welcomed by Boris Johnson after a stormy few weeks. Trudeau also spoke positively about rolling over the current terms of the trade deal Canada has with the EU to ensure the UK continues to benefit after the transition period. Under the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the EU and Canada, 95% of the imports covered are tariff and quota-free.
Trudeau said: “There have been many discussions over the past years between myself and Prime Minister Johnson and his predecessor on that seamless transition, on a rollover of the CETA between Canada and the EU, to be the basis for a Canada-UK free trade agreement that would allow certainty for Canadian and British companies going into the future. “I think you’ve heard that there are significant complexities that the UK is grappling with in terms of negotiating the post Brexit agreement with the EU. I can highlight that it’s fairly straightforward with Canada and we are certainly very optimistic in the ability to see things roll over smoothly.”",,Politics,Guardian,4
1291,"Canary Islands under pressure as 11,000 migrants arrive in 2020",10/29/20,"Spain’s migration secretary has acknowledged that the Canary Islands are struggling to cope with the arrival of more than 11,000 people so far this year, but says the government is working to increase reception capacity, manage migration and stop people dying at sea. The Spanish archipelago, which lies off the coast of north-west Africa, has experienced a massive rise in arrivals compared with last year, which has left resources strained, people sleeping on docks, and the regional government saying it has been overwhelmed. According to figures from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), 11,006 people have arrived in the Canaries since January this year, with 4,925 arrivals in October alone. Last year, 2,557 migrants arrived in the archipelago, up from 1,307 in 2018. An estimated 414 people have died trying to reach the Canaries so far this year – almost double the 210 fatalities recorded in 2019. On Saturday, at least 140 people died after a boat bound for the Canaries caught fire and then capsized off Senegal’s northwest coast. Migration experts believe the Atlantic route from Africa to Europe has been reactivated by smuggling groups in response to socio-economic factors and conflict in west Africa, while Covid-related measures and border closures have made it more difficult for some migrants to use other routes to Europe. Hana Jalloul, who became secretary of state for migration in Spain’s Socialist-led coalition in January, told the Guardian the arrivals were putting the Canaries’ infrastructure under the kind of pressure not seen for years. “To give you an idea, we’ve had the same number of arrivals over the course of a single week that we had over the whole of last year,” she said. In February, the migration ministry set up its own management centre in Tenerife with the capacity to accommodate 300-400 people and is about to open another centre. At the moment, however, the ministry is working with others to try to provide shelter to the new arrivals. “It’s true there are quite a few NGOs helping the migrants who’ve arrived and things are a bit overwhelming at the moment,” said Jalloul. She said the the pressure of the continuing new arrivals had been compounded by the need to hand back the schools and sports centres that had sheltered migrants as the new academic year began, adding: “We’ve had to do all that in record time but I think we’ve handled it well because we’ve been doing PCR tests on the migrants who then go into the reception system.” While the situation pales in comparison with 2006, when 31,000 migrants arrived in the Canaries, Jalloul said it underscored the need for an intelligent and multilateral approach to people-flows. “Migration is a historical fact and one that’s not going to stop because of a pandemic or an economic crisis,” she said. “It’s clear that everyone realises that we won’t be able to deal with this phenomenon unless we work in countries of origin. But we also need to focus on the mafias who abuse these people and push a dream that ends in death at sea.” The IOM said Saturday’s accident was the deadliest shipwreck logged this year. It called for “unity between governments, partners and the international community to dismantle trafficking and smuggling networks that take advantage of desperate youth”. The Senegalese government said its navy had rescued more than 388 people at sea over a two-week period this month, adding that it regretted “the resurgence of clandestine emigration by sea”. Much of Spain’s current diplomatic focus is on dealing with migration at source. “We’re putting a lot of emphasis on working jointly with countries of origin and transit to fight against clandestine migration by improving these countries’ capacity for managing migration,” said one diplomatic source. The message, added the source, was “zero tolerance” for people-traffickers and for those trying to bypass the correct channels to enter Spain – “what’s irregular is irregular, and we won’t accept it”. Jalloul said properly managed migration was essential to Europe as an “ageing continent” and one that celebrated social and cultural diversity. “We don’t see migration as a problem at all: we see people dying at sea as a problem and the existence of the mafias as a problem. That’s where we need to work, but migration per se is not a problem for us.” She also pointed out that the pandemic had revealed Spain’s dependence on people born overseas. “There’s nothing like being fragile to show you how much others can help,” said Jalloul. “The migrants who come here help us – and they’ve shown that in the time of Covid. The migrants are the ones who have looked after people at home and in care homes. And we’ve got migrants who were looked after by the state as children going into the countryside to lend a hand now that they’re 18 or 21.” Jalloul, who visited the Canary Islands in February, said prejudice and stereotypes often masked the incredible lengths to which people would go to escape poverty and violence. “How can you generalise about so many people who’ve had such different life trajectories and many of whom have suffered hugely to get here?” she said. “Many of them have been raped or mutilated, or are parents who have done everything they could for their children. In the Canaries, I met a woman who had given birth to a dead son on a small boat and who was stuck on that boat with her dead son. These people have gone through incredible hardship and sacrifice to give their children a future, as any parent would.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1292,Commons dismisses sexual assault claims against ex-MP Ross Thomson,10/29/20,"A Commons inquiry has dismissed sexual assault allegations made by a Labour MP against Ross Thomson, Boris Johnson’s former Scottish campaign manager, it has been reported. Paul Sweeney, who later lost his Glasgow North East seat in December 2019, alleged that Thomson drunkenly tried to fondle his genitals and forced a hand down his trousers in a Commons bar in 2018. Sweeney went public with his complaints a month before the general election, resulting in Thomson standing down as the Scottish Conservative candidate for Aberdeen South, the seat he had won at the 2017 election. He has always denied any wrongdoing. The parliamentary commissioner for standards has concluded that Thomson’s behaviour was not sexual in nature and cleared him of any breach of parliament’s misconduct policy, according to the Times. Sweeney said he could not comment for legal reasons. He has the right to appeal against the decision, which would be heard by an independent expert panel. Kathryn Stone, the commissioner, found that witness accounts did not support the allegations, the Times reports, and that while it was “entirely possible that discreet contact might not have been observed by others, Mr Sweeney’s account was of behaviour that was highly unlikely to have gone unnoticed by others in the immediate vicinity”. Stone reportedly said she was “concerned that the detail of Mr Sweeney’s account has changed, with new elements introduced over time, some of which have not been substantiated”, and added: “I cannot safely conclude that this complaint presents as a malicious one.” Sweeney submitted his complaint a few weeks after a separate allegation of “sexual touching” was made against Thomson, which had resulted in the police being called to the same bar, and about five months after the date of the alleged assault against him. No formal complaint was made to police in the earlier incident and no further action was taken. The commissioner reportedly found Sweeney’s explanation that he only raised the complaint when he thought Thomson might be a serial offender to be “plausible”. Speaking to the Times, Thomson said he believed his sexuality had influenced abuse that was directed towards him after the complaints were made public. He said: “If you look at other politicians who have had allegations against them … I can’t think of a politician who received more personal abuse than I did at the time. My only conclusion is that because I was gay I got more. Maybe that’s wrong but it’s how I feel.”",,Politics,Guardian,4
1293,"Covid has devastated UK pub industry, says Camra",10/29/20,"Coronavirus has had a “devastating” impact on the UK’s pubs and will exacerbate the decline in the number of independent breweries – for the first time in nearly two decades – an influential consumer guide has warned. Thousands of pubs and breweries that survived the first lockdown are now fighting to stay afloat amid a slump in business following ongoing restrictions and curfews that could “make or break” the industry, according to the 2021 Good Beer Guide, published on Thursday by the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra). The annual guide – now in its 48th edition – is considered the definitive guide to the best pints of real ale pulled in the UK and this year features 4,500 pubs, from country inns to no-frills micropubs and taprooms. Despite being hampered by lockdown and ongoing restrictions, thousands of volunteers worked to compile this year’s entries. There are an estimated 40,800 pubs in England and Wales. It reveals that the total number of independent UK breweries has dipped to 1,816 from 1,823 last year – the first time it has recorded a decline in numbers since the explosion in UK breweries started in 2008. While 163 breweries have opened this year and are newly listed, many more have closed their doors, cutting the net figure. Camra’s national chairman, Nik Antona, said Covid-19 was the biggest threat to British pubs in the organisation’s 50-year history. “Many pubs and breweries have fought hard and the majority have survived the first lockdown, but it’s clear the industry was already in a vulnerable position when Covid-19 hit,” he said. “Since then, breweries have all but been forgotten as new restrictions have been introduced, despite relying heavily on pubs as a key outlet for their products. It’s clear that preventing widespread closure and rebuilding our pub culture will be Camra’s greatest challenge yet.” Among the independent breweries to have called time this year is the award-winning Pershore Brewery in Worcestershire, whose owners Elizabeth and Sean Barnett announced its closure “with very heavy heart” in September. The guide’s foreword is penned by chef and restaurant owner Tom Kerridge who urges consumers to continue to support breweries and pubs to preserve them for future generations. “These figures are an early indication that all is not as it should be following a difficult year of lockdown restriction and social distancing measures,” he writes. “While every sector across the UK has felt the burden of Covid-19, brewers and pubs have taken the brunt of the impact. The one thing we have all missed during lockdown is human connection and social interaction, which above all else, is everything that the Great British pub provides – a warm, happy and friendly place for people to drink and eat.” A spokesman for Siba, the Society of Independent Brewers, said: “2020 has been one of the toughest on record for independent breweries, who have seen sales slump by an average of 82% during lockdown, leading to two breweries a week closing their doors for good this summer. Breweries have not had access to business rates holiday or grants, leaving them largely left out of government support packages. To make matters worse a tax hike is around the corner for hundreds of small breweries, which is likely to push many more struggling businesses over the edge.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1294,"Covid has hit 'critical' stage in England, research finds",10/29/20,"The Covid pandemic has reached a “critical” stage in England, with prevalence doubling since last month with the fastest increases in the south where the R number has risen above 2, research has found. While cases remain highest in northern England, a dramatic increase in infections has been recorded across all areas, according to the latest interim findings from the React-1 study from Imperial College London.
It triggered warnings from scientists that current measures – including bans for millions on households mixing and the closure of pubs – were not working and urgent action is needed to avoid a sharp rise in hospitalisations and deaths. The React-1 study found that infections are still highest among 18- to 24-year-olds (2.2%) but are spreading into older and more vulnerable age groups. The percentage of people infected aged 55-64 increased more than threefold from 0.37% to 1.2%. There has been a downturn in infections among young people in the north-east, where stricter restrictions were first imposed, the scientists said, but a large increase in the numbers among over-65s which is likely to translate to hospital admissions and deaths. In the south-west, which has had low prevalence, there is now a rise in infections in 18- to 24-year-olds. “We’re seeing a pattern in the south which is similar to what we saw in the north a few weeks back,” said Prof Paul Elliott, director of the programme at Imperial from the School of Public Health.
Since their last report, “everything has got worse”, he said. “It’s still the same simple message, which is that we have to reduce social interaction.” That may be through people changing their behaviour, perhaps in response to rising hospital admissions and deaths. “Whether that’s something that people really understand or whether it requires more intensive measures – that’s really a policy decision,” Elliott added. The study found that the England-wide R rate has risen to 1.6 since the last findings, from mid-September to early October, when it was 1.2. In the south-east, south-west, London and the east of England, R was over 2 – although without sufficient data for absolutely certainty. The interim findings are from half of the study – swabs taken from 85,000 people – and will need to be confirmed.
The R rate – the number of people each person with the virus infects – needs to be below 1 for the pandemic to shrink. The virus is doubling every nine days, the research found. Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said the “sobering numbers” should act as a wakeup call: “We can expect this situation to continue to deteriorate if authorities remain slow to react.” Prof Igor Rudan, joint director of the Centre for Global Health at the University of Edinburgh, said: “The measures that were in place over the past two months across most of Europe were clearly insufficient to prevent the new large growth of infected cases and fast spread of the virus.” The study will fuel calls for more restrictions on social gatherings in the runup to Christmas. The environment secretary, George Eustice, said on Wednesday that families will be banned from having large Christmas gatherings if necessary to curb the spread of the virus. Eustice said on LBC radio that it was too early to outline exactly what restrictions would be in place over the festive season, but admitted that families would be barred from “coming together in large gatherings” if necessary. It came as a leading government scientific adviser warned that the number of coronavirus patients in UK hospitals could pass the spring peak by the end of November without further lockdown measures. Sir Mark Walport, a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it was “not unrealistic” that there would be 25,000 people in hospital with Covid by the end of next month – higher than the April peak.
Walport compared the UK’s situation with France, where he said 16,000 Covid patients were in hospital including 2,500 people in intensive care – roughly half of its capacity – compared with 852 in intensive care in the UK. The situation was similar in Spain, he said. “With our current measures, which are similar but with variations in different parts of Europe, there’s good evidence that there isn’t as much social distancing as there was when we clamped down in the first wave,” he said. The React-1 study showed that Yorkshire and the Humber had the highest prevalence, at 2.7%, up from 0.84%, followed by north-west England (2.3% up from 1.2%). That means more than one in 40 people were infected in Yorkshire and the Humber as of Sunday 25 October. The report concluded: “The co-occurrence of high prevalence and rapid growth means that the second wave of the epidemic in England has now reached a critical stage. Whether via regional or national measures, it is now time-critical to control the virus and turn R below one if further hospital admissions and deaths from Covid-19 are to be avoided.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1295,"Covid pressure on health visitors puts generation of babies at risk, charities say",10/29/20,"A generation of babies born during the Covid-19 pandemic may be at risk because they and their parents are not being fully supported by health visitors in the weeks and months after birth, a coalition of children’s charities has said. The NSPCC and nine other early-years charities say restrictions to the service and redeployment of health visitors could mean thousands of families do not receive checks they are entitled to. Only one in 10 parents with children under the age of two saw a health visitor face to face during lockdown, according to a study published in August. Health visitors support new parents and infants from birth until the child is two, advising on feeding and growth, sleeping, vaccinations and development, and identifying parents who need mental health support. All families are entitled to five checks, the first usually a home visit. But a survey carried out by University College London in June and July found that in some areas of England as many as 50% of health visitors were redeployed during the first phase of the pandemic. Public Health England recently advised against such redeployment over the winter.
Even before the pandemic, NSPCC research found that one in four mothers had checks conducted by letter, text or phone instead of receiving face-to-face support. The NSPCC has written to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to tell him that England’s health visitor programme is not able to meet the challenges of the pandemic. More than 2,000 members of the public have also signed the letter. The NSPCC’s public affairs manager, Andrew Fellowes, said: “The government is at risk of failing a generation of children if it does not commit to rebuilding the nation’s public health services for families. Before the pandemic began the health visiting service was struggling to support parents and babies across the country, and we know it is not equipped to meet the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic. “We are urging Matt Hancock to ensure there is sufficient funding and resources, so no families are left behind at a time when they will be relying on this support the most.” Cheryll Adams, the chief executive of the Institute of Health Visiting, said: “Over the past five years we have seen an average 30% reduction in the number of health visitors in England, accompanied by a massive variation in these losses across the country. The average health visitor caseload is now 500 children, double the recommended number.
“The number of invisible vulnerable babies will have increased and perinatal mental illness is already reported by health visitors to be “sky rocketing”. The erosion of the health visitor role results in kicking the can down the road where the impact is picked up by other much more costly services.” The NSPCC received almost 1,900 calls to its helpline from people concerned about parental mental health in the six months since April. It has launched a campaign, Fight for a Fair Start, calling on the government to ensure new parents receive mental health support. The coalition consists of Action for Children, the Association of Child Psychotherapists, Best Beginnings, First 1001 Days Movement, Home Start, OXPIP, the Institute of Health Visiting, NCB, NSPCC and the Parent-Infant Foundation.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1296,"Five distinct types of dog existed by end of last ice age, study finds",10/29/20,"From tiny chihuahuas to fluffy Siberian huskies, dogs come in all shapes and sizes. But researchers have revealed there is more to canine diversity than meets the eye. Scientists have found five distinct groups of dogs were already present at the end of the last ice age, and their legacy lives on in our pets today. “[If] I walk through Wimbledon Common I am pretty likely to run across dogs that all have a little bit [of a] different history, tracing back as far as 11,000 years ago to different corners of the world,” said Dr Pontus Skoglund, co-author of the study and group leader of the ancient genomics laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London. Writing in the journal Science, Skoglund and colleagues report how they sequenced 27 ancient dog nuclear genomes from canines found in Europe, the near east and Siberia, dating from 800 to 11,000 years old.
The results reveal that by the end of the last ice age there were at least five genetically distinct groups of dogs in existence – suggesting the origins of our canine companions stretch back even further. However, all the groups appear to have descended from a single common ancestor, suggesting domestication may have occurred from a single population of ancient wolves. The researchers made further revelations when they compared their results with DNA from modern dogs, finding that breeds that originated in Europe, such as the German shepherd or Irish terrier, all appear to be descended from a roughly 50/50 mix of two of the ancient groups – those from the Levant and northern Europe. “Those ancestries came together in Europe, probably when the first farmers came into Europe and they brought their dogs and they met the dogs that were already there,” Skoglund told the Guardian. “Breeds in Europe today are less genetically distinct than the two in prehistory, in that they have a less deep history that doesn’t stretch back thousands of years ,” he added, although he noted artificial selection had led to breeds with particular traits. The team found that while DNA from modern European dogs has contributed to breeds around the world, traces of the other ice age groups remain – including in chihuahuas, a breed with roots in Mexico. “During the colonial era [modern European breeds] spread around the world, which is why you see a chihuahua is mostly [of that ancestry],” said Skoglund. But, he added, 4% of chihuahua DNA came from an ice age group from ancient America. Similarly, the Siberian husky, while carrying DNA from modern European dogs, also contains DNA from an ice age group from Russia, while the Rhodesian ridgeback has some ancestry from another ice age group. The team also used human and canine genetic data to explore whether dogs kept to heel as people moved across the world. The results reveal that in many cases, people and their dogs appear to have moved together, but that was not always the case. For example, while both dogs and people moved from the Levant to Europe during the agricultural expansion, only humans retained distinct ancestries in the aftermath. “The fact that we see sometimes the history doesn’t match, could mean people would move around while leaving their dogs behind, or having preferences for other types of dogs, but it could also be due to dog dynamics,” said Skoglund, noting another possibility was that dogs could have been traded. Despite the new insights, questions remain, including when and where the first dogs were domesticated. “That’s a huge mystery,” said Skoglund. Dr Elaine Ostrander, an expert in canine genetics from the National Human Genome Research Institute in the US, who was not involved in the study, said the work was exciting. “Perhaps the most compelling conclusions relate to their comparison of human-dog genomes,” she said, adding: “The identification of events where dogs moved between different human groups, or humans dispersed without dogs provides a granularity that we have not previously had in addressing these issues.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1297,France orders children aged six and over to wear masks in school,10/29/20,"Children in France aged six and over will have to wear face masks in the classroom to keep schools open, the prime minister said on the eve of a second national lockdown. Speaking before the national assembly backed the new restrictions by 399 votes to 27, Jean Castex said the mandatory use of masks was being extended to primary school pupils on the advice of public health officials. Only children over 11 have had to wear masks in school until now. France entered a new month-long national lockdown from midnight on Thursday in attempt to shield the health service, where 60% of intensive care beds are occupied by Covid patients, double the proportion of 15 days ago.
“There is no other solution,” the prime minister said of the measures announced by the president, Emmanuel Macron, on Wednesday evening. “We will have to manage a higher peak of hospitalisation in November than in April. The virus is accelerating, we must also accelerate.” France’s move is expected to be followed on Friday in Belgium, where the rate of infection is the worst in Europe, but across the continent cases of coronavirus are soaring. In Sweden, which has shunned lockdowns, the health agency moved on Thursday to tighten pandemic advice for three regions, including Stockholm and Gothenburg, saying infection rates were rising sharply. It advised residents to avoid indoor environments such as shops and gyms. The agency said there were 2,820 new coronavirus cases in Sweden on Thursday, the highest since the start of the pandemic and the third record number in a matter of days. On Thursday evening, the EU’s 27 heads of state and government during a videoconference summit discussed the coordination of the rollout of rapid tests as part of an attempt to take back control of the virus.
The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said it was also vital for member states to share data on intensive care unit capacity to facilitate cross-border care. Charles Michel, the European council president, who chaired the discussion, said: “We call on all Europeans to take care of themselves and one another … The numbers are increasing everywhere in Europe. Our hospitals and health workers are again under pressure and that is why many leaders have announced lockdowns and restrictions.” France’s lockdown will mean residents will again have to swear a declaration in order to leave their homes, and all non-essential businesses, including bars and restaurants, will be closed. Private gatherings will be banned, though people will be given time to return home from the All Saints’ Day holiday this weekend. Universities will give courses online.
Unlike during the spring lockdown, public services and schools will stay open. Castex said people driving their children to school would need a certificate and “in accordance with the opinion sent to us yesterday by the high council of public health, the wearing of masks will be extended to primary schoolchildren from the age of six. “Like all our large public services, national education must continue to function,” he said. “The nurseries, the schools, the colleges, high schools will remain open. The same goes for the extracurricular sector. I know that the teaching staff and all the educational staff will be there … [From Monday] the health protocol will be adapted and reinforced to ensure protection of all: children, teachers, parents of pupils.” The list of essential shops allowed to open will include those selling food, newspapers and stationery. Garages, computer repair shops, opticians and funeral parlours will also be exempt from the shutdown. In a televised statement later on Thursday, Castex said those taking exercise would only be allowed to travel within 1km of their homes and could be outside of their houses for no longer than an hour. “You will only be able to leave your home for certain reasons and provided with a certificate,” Castex said, adding that a fixed fine of €135 (£122) would be applied in the event of non-compliance with the lockdown rules. France’s borders will also be generally shut to those coming from outside the EU and those coming from outside the passport-free Schengen area must have a negative test or be tested.
The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, also defended her government’s new tough shutdown measures, announced on Wednesday in the Bundestag, saying propaganda and conspiracy theories were undermining the fight against the pandemic. As she was jeered by members of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party, Merkel said: “Let me be clear. Lies and disinformation, conspiracy and hate damage not only democratic debate but also the fight against the coronavirus.” Merkel agreed with Germany’s 16 state leaders in a video conference on Wednesday to shut restaurants, bars, cinemas, theatres, gyms and public pools among other leisure facilities for the month of November to try to contain a surge in infections. Schools, nurseries, shops and other essential businesses will stay open and there will be no restrictions on people leaving their homes. Merkel said new cases had doubled over the past week and intensive care units were quickly nearing capacity. “The measures we are adopting are appropriate, necessary and proportional,” she said. “At the beginning of the cold time of the year, we find ourselves in a dramatic situation … The winter will be hard, four long difficult months, but it will come to an end.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1298,"France will not give in to terror after Nice attack, Macron says",10/29/20,"France will not give in to terror, Emmanuel Macron has said, in a call for firmness and unity after the country’s latest terrorist attack left three people dead. The president issued a sombre but defiant message after a man armed with a knife killed two women and a man in the Notre-Dame basilica in central Nice, the second such attack in France in less than a fortnight. The man entered the church carrying a knife with a 17cm blade around 8.30am; within 30 minutes he had killed two people and fatally injured a third.
One of the victims was a 60-year-old woman who had been in the basilica praying since shortly after it opened at about 8.30am. France’s anti-terrorist prosecutor Jean-François Ricard said she had her throat cut “to the point of being almost decapitated”. A man, believed to be the church sexton, was the second victim. He was named as Vincent Loqués, 55, and a father of two children. He also reportedly had his throat cut. A woman, aged 44, was stabbed several times and critically injured but managed to escape from the church to a nearby bar, where she died of her injuries. She has been named in Brazilian press as Simone Barreto Silva, a mother of three and originally from Salvador. Police described the scene as a “vision of horror”. City police who were first at the scene shot the killer several times after he reportedly refused to drop the knife, injuring him in the shoulder. By 9.10am the attacker had been “neutralised”. French officials praised the prompt police action in preventing further bloodshed. The national anti-terrorist prosecutor has opened an investigation into “killings linked to a terrorist organisation”. At a press conference on Thursday evening, Ricard said the attacker was carrying three knives – two of which were not used in the attack – and a Qur’an.
He was named by French media as Brahim Aouissaoui, a 21-year-old Tunisian national who reportedly entered France illegally via Lampedusa, Italy, at the beginning of October. Aouissaoui was not carrying any identity papers apart from a document from the Italian Red Cross.
Ricard said the man was picked up by CCTV cameras at Nice station at 6.47am. “He changed his jacket and his shoes. He then walked 400m to Notre-Dame basilica. He entered at 8.29am,” the prosecutor announced. “At 8.57am, the municipal police intervened and entered the church. The man, shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’, was shot.” Ricard said investigators had established that Aouissaoui was registered at Lampedusa in Italy on 20 September and had been at the Italian Adriatic port of Bari on 9 October. Thursday’s attack came 13 days after an 18-year-old man beheaded Samuel Paty, 47, a history teacher, outside his high school north-east of Paris. The professor had shown pupils caricatures, including one of the prophet Muhammad published in the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, during a discussion on freedom of speech. Macron promised after Paty’s murder to crack down on Islamist extremism, including shutting down mosques and other organisations accused of fomenting radicalism and violence. His comments sparked angry protests across the Muslim world and calls for a boycott of French goods. Macron also made reference on Thursday to the 2016 killing of Father Jacques Hamel, a Catholic priest whose throat was cut by two men inside his Normandy church.
“It is France that is under attack,” the president said. “Three of our compatriots died at the basilica in Nice today and at the same time a French consular site was attacked in Saudi Arabia. “I want to express, first and foremost, the nation’s support for the Catholics of France and elsewhere. After 2016, with the killing of Father Hamel, it is the Catholics of our country attacked once more, and just before All Saints’ Day. We are at their side in order that religion can be freely exercised in our country. People can believe or not believe, all religions can be practised, but today the nation is beside our Catholic compatriots. “My second message is to Nice and the people of Nice who have already suffered as a result of the Islamist terrorist folly. This is the third time terrorism has struck your city and you have the support and solidarity of the nation. “If we have been attacked once again, it is because of our values, our taste for freedom; the freedom to believe freely and not give in to any terror. We will give in to nothing. Today we have increased our security to deal with the terrorist threat.”
Macron said the French military was being mobilised to protect all places of worship, particularly Catholic churches, for the religious holiday of All Saints Day on Sunday. The number of soldiers on the streets is to be raised from 3,000 to 7,000 and troops will be deployed outside schools for the return to class on Monday.
“Our absolute determination in the face of these acts will continue and we will protect all our citizens. In response, my message is one of absolute firmness and unity. There is only one community in France, the national community,” he said. Just two hours after the Nice attack, police in Avignon shot and killed an man with firearm who had assaulted a merchant of North African descent. Officials said the man was shot after refusing to drop his weapon and ignoring a warning shot. Avignon Prosecutor Philippe Guemas said the man belonged to extreme-right group Generation Identity and appeared to be “psychologically unstable.” A witness to the Nice attack, a man called David who runs a restaurant opposite the church, told BFMTV he had alerted the police. “I was selling croissants when a man came in and said to me: ‘Sir, there’s a decapitated woman in the cathedral.’ I didn’t believe him at first but he repeated it. I went to the cathedral and saw the municipal police and called to them. They came quickly.” The Conseil Français du Culte Musulman (French Muslim Council, CFCM) condemned Thursday’s attack and called on Muslims to cancel their Mawlid celebrations – from 28-29 October to mark the birth of the Prophet – as a “sign of mourning and solidarity with the victims and their loved ones”.
The mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, said the whole of Nice was deeply shocked: “Enough is enough … We have to remove this Islamo-fascism from our territory.” Also on Thursday, Le Progrès newspaper reported that a man in “traditional Afghan dress” and carrying a knife was arrested in Lyon, and a Saudi man was arrested in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, after injuring a guard at the French consulate with a “sharp tool”, state television reported.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1299,From MacDonald to Corbyn: a history of Labour leaders who ran afoul of the party,10/29/20,"Jeremy Corbyn already had a special place in the political record books. His more than 600 career Commons votes against Labour make him easily the most rebellious backbench MP ever to become a party leader. But Corbyn’s suspension from the party he led until April this year is a spectacular new first. No former Labour leader in history has ever been suspended from the party. However, if Corbyn’s suspension – which he has said he will “strongly contest” – leads to his eventual expulsion, he will share a fate with a very different former Labour leader, in the shape of Ramsay MacDonald. The two men and the two cases could hardly be more different. Corbyn has spent his career as a man of the Labour left, mostly on the back benches. MacDonald was expelled from Labour in 1931, when, as a Labour prime minister, he formed a National Government with Conservative and Liberal support in the face of the economic depression and surge in unemployment that followed the 1929 Wall Street crash. Although a handful of Labour MPs followed MacDonald into the National Government in August 1931, the majority elected Arthur Henderson to succeed him and went into opposition. MacDonald nevertheless remained a member of the Labour party for another month, even as prime minister, before the Labour national executive finally expelled him “automatically and immediately” in September 1931. He instantly became the most vilified figure in Labour history, serving as prime minister for another four years until 1935. He died during a sea voyage in November 1937. The only other Labour leader to run afoul of the party in a comparable way was Michael Foot, the leader from 1980-83. Like Corbyn, Foot spent the bulk of his long parliamentary career – he was first elected in 1945 – as a leftwing backbench rebel. Foot, like Corbyn this week, eventually lost the Labour whip for his frequent revolts. In March 1961 he voted against the party line over air force spending, and was expelled from the parliamentary Labour group. Foot only regained the whip after the election of Harold Wilson as Labour leader in February 1963. Stafford Cripps, Clement Attlee’s chancellor of the exchequer from 1947-50, is the only postwar holder of the one of the great ministerial offices to have actually been expelled from Labour. That happened in 1939, when Cripps, then the MP for Bristol South-East (later the constituency of Tony Benn), advocated a “popular front” electoral strategy with the Communist and Liberal parties and with anti-Appeasement Conservatives. He rejoined Labour in 1945. No Conservative leader of modern times has ever been expelled from the party. Iain Duncan Smith, leader from 2001-03, probably came closest, as a serial backbench rebel over Europe during the premiership of John Major in the 1990s. Much the most senior Conservatives to lose the party whip in recent years were the former chancellors of the exchequer Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond and the former home secretary Amber Rudd, who were among more than 20 Tory MPs punished for voting against Boris Johnson on Brexit in September 2019. In the current parliament, elected in December 2019, Corbyn is the second Labour MP to lose the party whip. He joins Claudia Webbe, who lost the whip pending a court appearance next month in a harassment case. Webbe has not been expelled from the Labour party. Other “independent” MPs in the current parliament now include Julian Lewis, who lost the Conservative whip after becoming chair of the Commons intelligence and security committee with Labour support earlier this year, and the former SNP MP Margaret Ferrier, who lost the whip for travelling from Glasgow to London and back after testing positive for Covid-19.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1300,Hong Kong activist who sought US consulate help charged with secession,10/29/20,"A Hong Kong court has denied bail to a 19-year-old activist who was arrested under the national security law while attempting to shelter inside the US consulate. Tony Chung is the only the second of at least 27 people arrested under the law to be charged, and now faces prosecution for alleged crimes of secession, money laundering and conspiracy to publish seditious material. The last charge falls under colonial-era criminal laws. On Thursday morning, Chung appeared at West Kowloon magistrates court, where he was denied bail and held in remand ahead of his next scheduled court appearance on 7 January. Chung was detained on Tuesday morning at a coffee shop while he waited for the nearby US consulate to open. Friends of Hong Kong, a UK-based organisation which says it has been assisting Chung, said they spoke to him at around 8.10am, and then received a report from a bystander a few minutes later that he had been taken away by men appearing to be officers.
The US does not grant asylum to people at its diplomatic postings – asylum seekers must be physically present on US soil. However, the Hong Kong consulate is an application processing post for the US refugee program, according to state department websites. Friends of Hong Kong said Chung had submitted his paperwork weeks earlier, but fear of an imminent arrest prompted him to seek shelter at the consulate. The consulate declined to comment. Two other members of Chung’s now-disbanded activism group, Yanni Ho and William Chan, were also arrested later on Tuesday but were released on bail. In July, Chung, Chan and Ho were among four student activists arrested under the Beijing-imposed national security law, for allegedly advocating online for an independent Hong Kong. Chung’s passport was confiscated and he was released on bail. The national security law was imposed on the region in late June, criminalising acts of subversion, secession, foreign collusion and terrorism. It has been criticised as so broadly defined as to infringe upon basic human rights of free speech and assembly, and breach international law. Hundreds of people have fled Hong Kong seeking asylum overseas including in Australia, Canada, and the US, but the Hong Kong government maintains there is no persecution of residents. Chung’s appearance in court came as the Hong Kong police force prepared to launch a multi-platform hotline for people to report information relating to possible breaches of the national security law, the South China Morning Post reported on Thursday. According to the report, the identities of the callers would be kept anonymous, and all information would be handled by the national security division of the force. “It will also create a deterrent effect for potential suspects, as there will be eyes and ears everywhere,” the article quoted an unnamed government source.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1301,Investigation begins into Rhodes parasailing accident that left two British teens dead,10/29/20,"Greek judicial authorities have ordered an official investigation into a parasailing accident off Rhodes after two British teenagers died and a third was left in a critical condition. The victims were named locally as 15-year-old Jessica Lee-Hayes and her 13-year-old cousin Michael Connelly. Doctors said the boy’s older brother, James, 15, was fighting for his life in Rhodes general hospital after being severely injured in the fall. The teens, from Kettering, were holidaying with their parents who had booked into a hotel in the nearby settlement of Pefki. Speaking to the Sun from the hospital, Jessica’s father, Tony, spoke of his family’s devastation, saying: “It’s like the world’s come to an end.” “Jessica was a beautiful, beautiful lady. Extremely popular and very special. Mikey, her cousin, exactly the same. They’ve been stolen from us and we’re devastated.” A public prosecutor released Nikos Mallios, the owner of a water sports company who was detained in the wake of the tragedy, pending the inquiry’s findings. “The prosecutor gave instructions for the investigation to be expanded,” a police source said. Until then he [Mallios] has been released temporarily. No conditions have been set.” The proprietor of a sea sports outlet in Lindos, Mallios appeared before the prosecutor on Thursday, a day after the tragedy unfolded outside the resort town. The 51-year-old was piloting the speedboat when coastguard officials said the towrope attached to the trio’s parasailing parachute snapped in stormy weather. The youngsters were then propelled by gale force winds to a craggy promontory, where their bodies were later found. “He was remanded in custody overnight,” a local coastguard officer said. “This is a huge tragedy and questions of responsibility have been raised. He has been detained in our holding cells and like everyone is in a state of shock.” Authorities confirmed that the teenagers had died of injuries sustained on impact after falling from “an extremely high altitude” on to the rocks. Rodiaki, the island’s oldest newspaper, reported emotional scenes outside the hospital, with the mother of the boy who had narrowly survived fainting as medics rushed him into the emergency ward. Following similar tragedies, legislation has been tightened around popular water sports in the country, with parasailing requirements prohibiting three people or more from being towed at any one time. Minors under the age of 18 are barred from participating, while the sport is strictly forbidden in adverse weather conditions. Advertising the “adrenaline pumping” activity on its website, the Lindos-based water sports company says: “We offer single and tandem (two people flying together) harness rides. Children can fly tandem with adults, no experience is required.” The island’s coastguard chief, Spyros Tatis, who is overseeing the initial investigation, has reportedly argued in favour of charges of involuntary manslaughter and grievous bodily harm charges being brought. His inquiry will form the basis of further investigations that will be decisive in the public prosecutor’s ultimate decision. “There is outrage on the island and a sense that justice must be served,” said one well-placed source. “So many of us woke up this morning thinking of the children’s parents.” Parasailing accidents are not uncommon across the Mediterranean. In a similar incident in Turkey in 2011, a British holidaymaker plunged to his death when his harness snapped while parasailing. Two men were subsequently jailed. Last year an 18-year-old Russian tourist also died in Turkey when his parasailing cable broke 200ft above the sea.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1302,Jeremy Corbyn rejects overall findings of EHRC report on antisemitism in Labour,10/29/20,"Jeremy Corbyn has rejected the overall conclusions of a report on antisemitism in Labour, saying the problem was “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media – a statement that sets him at odds with Keir Starmer. In a Facebook post responding to the Equality and Human Rights Commission report, which found Labour responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination over antisemitism, the former Labour leader said he had been obstructed by party officials in trying to tackle the issue. However, he expressed regret that “it took longer to deliver that change than it should”. The report does not lay blame directly with Corbyn but the EHRC’s lead investigator, Alasdair Henderson, said the failure of leadership must ultimately stop with him. “As the leader of the party at the time, and given the extent of the failings we found in the political interference within the leader of the opposition’s office, Jeremy Corbyn is ultimately accountable and responsible for what happened at that time,” Henderson said. Corbyn’s argument that the problem was exaggerated for factional reasons places him on a potential collision path with Starmer, who said in his response to the report that those who made such arguments were “part of the problem”. Asked about Corbyn’s response to the report, Starmer told reporters he would “look carefully” at his predecessor’s comments. Corbyn said in his statement: “One antisemite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media. “That combination hurt Jewish people and must never be repeated. My sincere hope is that relations with Jewish communities can be rebuilt and those fears overcome. While I do not accept all of its findings, I trust its recommendations will be swiftly implemented to help move on from this period.” The EHRC launched its inquiry after complaints about antisemitism within Labour during Corbyn’s time as leader. The report cites “serious failings in the Labour party leadership in addressing antisemitism and an inadequate process for handling antisemitism complaints”. Corbyn said that when he took over as Labour leader in 2015, “the party’s processes for handling complaints were not fit for purpose”. He added: “Reform was then stalled by an obstructive party bureaucracy.” Corbyn argued that from 2018 the party’s new general secretary, Jennie Formby, and his officials “made substantial improvements, making it much easier and swifter to remove antisemites. My team acted to speed up, not hinder the process.”
He said: “Anyone claiming there is no antisemitism in the Labour party is wrong. Of course there is, as there is throughout society, and sometimes it is voiced by people who think of themselves as on the left. Jewish members of our party and the wider community were right to expect us to deal with it, and I regret that it took longer to deliver that change than it should.” In a separate response, Formby also said the party had sought to speed up the process of dealing with complaints about antisemitism, while accepting mistakes. “Under Jeremy Corbyn’s initiative, we brought reforms to conference which were passed by Labour members and affiliates that enabled rapid expulsions,” she said. “Mistakes were made along the way, and of course I wish we could have made the reforms more quickly, although some of them required rule changes which are necessarily slow. “But the record shows that as a result of the changes we made, Labour’s previously unfit processes were transformed, becoming more rapid, robust and more independent than any other political party.” Calling on Starmer to implement the EHRC’s recommendations, she said: “I hope that this continued work can rebuild relations with the Jewish community and mend the hurt and pain that has been caused.”",,Politics,Guardian,4
1303,Jeremy Corbyn to fight suspension from Labour after EHRC antisemitism report comments â€“ as it happened,10/29/20,"The repercussions of todayâ€™s events are likely to be felt in the Labour party for a long time to come - hereâ€™s a rundown of events as they happened. EHRC report finds Labour responsible for unlawful acts of discrimination and harassment. An investigation into the Labour party by the equalities watchdog found it was responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination, and identified what it described as â€œserious failings in the Labour party leadership in addressing antisemitism and an inadequate process for handling antisemitism complaintsâ€�. Jeremy Corbyn said he did not accept all of the EHRCâ€™s findings and that the scale of the antisemitism problem in Labour was â€œdramatically overstatedâ€� for political reasons. He also said he was â€œdetermined to eliminate all forms of racism and root out the cancer of anti-Semitismâ€� and admitted â€œJewish members of our party and the wider community were right to expect us to deal with it, and I regret that it took longer to deliver that change than it should.â€� Labour given until 10 December to draft an action plan. The party was given until 10 December to draft an action plan to implement the reportâ€™s recommendations, which is legally enforceable by the courts if not fulfilled. Keir Starmer said it was a â€˜day of shameâ€™ for the Labour party. â€œThe EHRCâ€™s reports are stark and leave no room for equivocation,â€� Keir Starmer said in his first reaction to the release. Labour suspended Jeremy Corbyn. A Labour party spokesman said: â€œIn light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour Party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation.â€� Corbyn said he would contest â€˜political interventionâ€™ to suspend him. â€œIâ€™ve made absolutely clear that those who deny there has been an antisemitism problem in the Labour party are wrong,â€� he said in a statement. Momentum described Corbynâ€™s suspension as â€˜massive attack on the leftâ€™. Momentum, which was set set up in 2015 to support the leftwing of the Labour party under the leadership of Corbyn, said the suspension should be immediately lifted in the interests of party unity. Keir Starmer said he â€˜fully supportsâ€™ the move to suspend Jeremy Corbyn. â€œI made it clear that we would not support antisemitism or the denial of antisemitism through the suggestion that it is exaggerated or factional and that is why I was disappointed by Jeremy Corbynâ€™s response and that is why appropriate action has been taken, which I fully support,â€� he said. Jeremy Corbyn urged Labour supporters to â€˜stay in the partyâ€™ and fight. In an interview following the removal of the party whip Corbyn called for calm and for members to â€œmake the caseâ€� for leftwing values internally. Unite boss Len McCluskey said Corbyn suspension will â€˜create chaosâ€™ in Labour party. Corbyn ally McCluskey said the division created by todayâ€™s events would leave Labour â€œdoomed to defeatâ€�. Cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, wrote a scathing letter to Keir Starmer, challenging him over his â€œfailure to speak outâ€� on antisemitism during his time in the shadow cabinet, and demanding answers on Corbynâ€™s future in the Labour party.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1304,Jewish Labour councillors who led EHRC antisemitism process tell of mental toll,10/29/20,"More than 70 whistleblowers consisting of current or former Labour staff, MPs and officials submitted testimony on antisemitism to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, as part of a coordinated effort by two Jewish Labour councillors who say the process has left them traumatised. The Guardian can reveal that two of the whistleblowers were offered physical security, guidance against potential cyber-attacks, legal advice and counselling as part of a concerted effort to collect widespread evidence of antisemitism across the party. The two councillors from the Jewish Labour Movement received 800 pieces of submitted evidence from Labour members of their experiences in the party, which included posters of Donald Trump being left on members’ lawns and threats of violence. Both Adam Langleben, a former Labour councillor in Barnet, north London, and Peter Mason, who remains a councillor in Ealing, west London, say the experience of submitting evidence to the EHRC cost them their mental wellbeing.
Mason and Langleben said they had initially tried to work with the then Labour leadership and be a bridge between the party and the Jewish community. However, they described losing faith in the leadership’s ability to take antisemitism seriously after Jeremy Corbyn’s defence of an antisemitic mural was revealed in 2018, leading to a protest by members of the Jewish community outside parliament. Mason said he was visiting the attraction Thorpe Park, watching a video on his phone of an apology by Corbyn that he felt he could not accept, when he decided to change tack. “I knew any attempt to try to win them over to the argument that the community was making was just over,” he said. After a slew of new antisemitism allegations and frustration at the party’s response, a decision was taken to gather evidence for a possible EHRC referral using the JLM website to call for member submissions. The initial referral to the equalities watchdog was made by a separate group – the Campaign Against Antisemitism – but Mason said they were worried the referral would need to solely rely on public statements and social media, rather than the insider experiences of Jewish members and Labour staff, which only a Labour-affiliated group could reach. “We were desperately concerned about the EHRC basically wading into a political fight,” Mason said. “Are they really going to launch an investigation into the Labour party, a potential future government? So let’s spend some time at least figuring out if we’ve got an argument.” Langleben took charge of filtering more than 800 submissions, saying the majority met the threshold for antisemitism. “What we felt was unique was the experience of Jewish members in physical meetings and the interactions with officers.” Mason said it was important for them to stress in their submission to the watchdog that it was not a case of anonymous trolling on Twitter. “There’s been a lot of discussion about dossiers of screengrabs of Twitter and Facebook, that crowded out arguments we were making about people’s real lived experiences,” he said. “People would speak out in CLP meetings about antisemitism, and then would find images of Trump being left on their lawn.” The initial referral to the EHRC had one whistleblower statement, from a member of staff who worked inside Corbyn’s office, and about 500 pages of supporting evidence from witness statements. JLM began to crowdfund for legal advice in early 2019 but also received what they described as “kind” help from lawyers at Mishcon de Reya who were “invested in it.” After the EHRC formally launched its investigation in May 2019, Mason said they began to have “discreet conversations with what turned out to be a significant number of whistleblowers … who felt they needed to break the silence over the extent of antisemitism, but also defend their own positions in what had or hadn’t happened previously”. Eight former Labour staffers went public in a BBC Panorama documentary later that year, alleging consistent interference from the leader’s office in antisemitism disciplinary cases, which allies of Corbyn strongly deny. That prompted a flood of contacts from Labour HQ, from people who said they felt “duty-bound” to speak to the investigation. Langleben and Mason said whistleblowers who contacted them about giving evidence to the EHRC were offered legal advice, counselling and physical security. “We do have a member in south London who was physically assaulted,” he said. Mason said he and Langleben would often play roles of “good cop, bad cop” with whistleblowers who told them their stories. “Adam had left [Labour] and I’d stayed; I was in a very deep and dark place, and Adam probably felt liberated. I ended up just displacing a lot of my anger. “We’re constantly asking ourselves the question: by offering a package of support to whistleblowers, are we leading people to give us incorrect testimony? So we were like dogs with bones, trying to make sure that we always got to the actual proper truth.” Langleben lost his council seat in the 2018 local elections, blaming Labour antisemitism fears among voters in north London, and left the party the following year, partly in solidarity with Luciana Berger, the MP who quit Labour over antisemitism, joining Change UK and then the Lib Dems before losing her seat. “I think the anguish inside of me got to the point where actually I [could] no longer justify to myself remaining,” he said. Mason remains a Labour member, saying he felt the good he was doing on the council “building houses, enabling people to have decent incomes” was a key factor, as well as his responsibility to Jewish members. “I basically traded that responsibility to Jewish members for my mental health,” he said. “There is this unrelenting pressure in your local party that you are evil, you’re not really Labour, you’re doing a disservice to Labour, because you have the temerity to speak about antisemitism, that continued well beyond the election.” Both feel the party has much further to go beyond just accepting the recommendation of the EHRC. “It’s going to be how [the Labour leader] Keir Starmer deals with the community more broadly, but also the party politically and the culture,” Mason said. “If Labour conference were to convene today, with the same delegates from 2019, there’s not a single recommendation that the EHRC could make that would survive conference floor.”",,Politics,Guardian,4
1305,Keir Starmer had his response ready. Then came Corbyn's post,10/29/20,"Jeremy Corbyn walked out of a community centre in Crouch End, north London, at just after 1pm on Thursday to learn from a journalist that he had been suspended from the Labour party. The man who was Labour party leader as recently as April had not received a telephone call or text to let him know that the whip had been taken away from him. Corbyn found out after recording a television clip reacting to the highly critical report from the equalities watchdog released that morning. A Labour MP since 1983, Corbyn froze for a moment in the chill October wind before moving swiftly on. Action had been taken against Corbyn, MP for Islington North, because of a Facebook post, released that morning, in which he claimed that the problem of antisemitism was “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media.
It was a crucial moment in a turbulent 24 hours when the faultlines within the Labour party were exposed by the conclusions of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission report. The move led to warnings from left-leaning union leaders and MPs, who said they would fight to keep the Corbyn project alive. There had been no hint of what was to come on Wednesday evening when Corbyn, Keir Starmer, the party’s new leader, and his deputy, Angela Rayner, discussed their respective plans for responding to the report. Starmer, the former director of public prosecutions, had read the findings in their entirety and was ready to make an unqualified apology for the party’s failings. His allies believe he had little choice, given the report’s damning conclusions. Labour, it said, was responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination over antisemitism. It cited “serious failings in the Labour party leadership in addressing antisemitism and an inadequate process for handling antisemitism complaints”. Starmer knew that Labour, only the second political party after the BNP to be investigated by the body, was about to be served with an unlawful act notice and had until 10 December to draft an action plan to implement a series of changes. During the talks on Wednesday, Starmer spoke directly to Corbyn in what was described as a “friendly and professional” conversation. Corbyn’s team say they were told that they would be given prior sight of Starmer’s statement. Discussions also took place about whether Starmer and the party’s general secretary, David Evans, had any intention of taking disciplinary action against Corbyn. According to his team, the former Labour leader received reassurances that action was not planned. However, sources close to Starmer insist nothing was agreed or planned with Corbyn in advance. The report was released at 10am the following day as scheduled, and it made for painful reading. Headlines travelled across the world stating that the UK Labour party, which founded the EHRC and has been at the forefront of fighting racism since its foundation, had unlawfully discriminated against Jewish members. Corbyn’s team had prepared their response but had still not received any notification of Starmer’s speech, it is claimed. At 10.36am, Corbyn’s statement was published. He wrote he had been obstructed by party officials in trying to tackle the issue. The statement said: “One antisemite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media. “That combination hurt Jewish people and must never be repeated. My sincere hope is that relations with Jewish communities can be rebuilt and those fears overcome. While I do not accept all of its findings, I trust its recommendations will be swiftly implemented to help move on from this period.” Starmer’s staffers were stunned. Within minutes, Starmer was due to speak directly to the nation at a televised press conference to apologise for failing to tackle antisemitism. He had little time to adjust a prepared speech, and chose not to. At 11am, he appeared before TV cameras, saying that those who “deny there is a problem are part of the problem … those who pretend it is exaggerated or factional are part of the problem”.
Reporters at the press conference asked about Corbyn’s response to the report, questioning whether the MP would be suspended for saying that the allegations had been “exaggerated”. Starmer said he would “look carefully” at them. By 12.15pm Corbyn had arrived in Crouch End to record interviews with broadcasters. Again, he said he disagreed with a number of the report’s points and repeatedly said that the number of antisemitism cases had been “exaggerated”. The decision to suspend Corbyn was taken by Evans, rather than Starmer. Just after 1pm a statement was released by Labour suspending him from the party and stripping him of the party whip. “In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation,” a spokesperson said. Corbyn’s allies said if Starmer’s office had shared his speech they would have seen the leader’s plan to refer to “exaggerated claims”, and would have modified Corbyn’s statement.
In a later Facebook statement, Corbyn wrote: “I will strongly contest the political intervention to suspend me. I’ve made absolutely clear that those who deny there has been an antisemitism problem in the Labour party are wrong. “It’s … undeniable that a false impression has been created of the number of members accused of antisemitism, as polling shows: that is what has been overstated, not the seriousness of the problem.” Allies of Corbyn last night condemned the move and urged Starmer to allow him back into the party. John McDonnell, who served as shadow chancellor throughout Corbyn’s tenure as leader, said the party’s decision should be overturned. “On the day we should all be moving forward and taking all steps to fight antisemitism, the suspension of Jeremy Corbyn is profoundly wrong.” Len McCluskey, leader of Unite, said the suspension appeared to contradict one of the report’s key recommendations – to remove the leader’s office from party investigations – and warned of chaos across the movement. McCluskey said: “It is also an act of grave injustice which, if not reversed, will create chaos within the party and in doing so compromise Labour’s chances of a general election victory.” Many others in the parliamentary party and across the shadow cabinet supported the move. One shadow cabinet member said this could be “a clause 4 moment for Keir”. Rayner said Corbyn had “an absolute blind spot” on appreciating the scale of the problem of antisemitism. “I’m devastated that it’s come to this. Today should be about really listening, reading and taking in the report,” she said. His suspension was welcomed by Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, who said: “Having presided over the descent of a proudly anti-racist party into a party that broke equalities law in its treatment of Jews, his shameless comments today showed that he remains part of the problem.”",,Politics,Guardian,4
1306,Key findings of the EHRC inquiry into Labour antisemitism,10/29/20,"The Labour party could have tackled antisemitism more effectively “if the leadership had chosen to do so”, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) concluded as part of its 130-page investigation released on Thursday. The watchdog also found that Labour breached the Equality Act in two cases – relating to the former London mayor Ken Livingstone and a borough councillor, Pam Bromley – “by committing unlawful harassment” against Jewish people. Here is a breakdown of some of the key findings. Labour leadership “We found specific examples of harassment, discrimination and political interference in our evidence,” the EHRC said in its foreword, adding: “But equally of concern was a lack of leadership within the Labour party on these issues, which is hard to reconcile with its stated commitment to a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism.” No individuals are named as being responsible by the watchdog. Instead, the report criticises the party hierarchy broadly for failing to take decisive action, despite what it says are “recent improvements” in handling complaints. “Although some improvements have been made to the process for dealing with antisemitism complaints, it is hard not to conclude that antisemitism within the Labour party could have been tackled more effectively if the leadership had chosen to do so,” the report states. Interference in the complaints process The EHRC concludes that “there was political interference in the handling of antisemitism complaints”, which it said was part of a “wider practice” of the leader of the opposition’s office getting involved “in disciplinary cases that were deemed ‘politically sensitive’”. It reviewed 70 complaint files between March 2016 and May 2019 and concluded that there were 23 instances of political interference by staff from the leader’s office and others. “These included clear examples of interference at various stages throughout the complaint-handling process, including in decisions on whether to investigate and whether to suspend,” the EHRC said. As a result, the equality watchdog concluded this “was indirectly discriminatory and unlawful” and it held that the Labour party was legally responsible for it. The Corbyn mural complaint There was “political interference” in decisions about whether to investigate complaints, the EHRC said, citing the example of a complaint made in April 2018 about Jeremy Corbyn, who had previously posted a statement in support of an artist who had produced an antisemitic mural in the East End of London. Staff from Corbyn’s office called for the case to be dismissed, emailing the party’s governance and legal unit, which was responsible for complaints. The email said: “The complaint itself seems to fall well below the threshold required for investigation and if so surely the decision to dismiss it can be taken now.” Staff from Corbyn’s office also “amended and approved” the written response to the complainant “to include details on Jeremy Corbyn’s actions in relation to the mural” even though Labour’s stated process excluded staff from the leader’s office becoming involved in complaints. Ken Livingstone case Labour breached the Equality Act in two cases, the EHRC said, when its agents were engaged in “committing unlawful harassment”, including using “antisemitic tropes and suggesting that complaints of antisemitism were fake or smears”. One was the case of Livingstone, who in April 2016 sought to defend a Labour MP, Naz Shah, who had reposted a Facebook image suggesting that Israel be relocated to the United States. At the time, Livingstone was a member of Labour’s national executive committee and so, according to the EHRC, an agent of the party. “Ken Livingstone repeatedly denied that these posts were antisemitic,” the EHRC said. “In his denial, Ken Livingstone alleged that scrutiny of Naz Shah’s conduct was part of a smear campaign by ‘the Israel lobby’ to stigmatise critics of Israel as antisemitic, and was intended to undermine and disrupt the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn MP.” In conclusion, the EHRC said Shah’s comments “went beyond legitimate criticism of the Israeli government” and were not protected by rights to free expression. “Neither is Ken Livingstone’s support for those comments,” the EHRC added. Emails show many examples of interference in Livingstone’s case, the EHRC said. In April 2018, two years after his original comments, members of the party’s governance and legal unit (GLU) “sought the green light” from staff at the leader’s office to conduct a disciplinary interview with the former mayor. Leader’s office staff agreed that “there was no option but to authorise the interview”. One staff member, Laura Murray, commented: “We have let the Ken case drag on for far too long already and, if GLU leak to the press that we have held up this investigation of him, it will look beyond awful.” Livingstone had been suspended from the party in April 2016. He resigned in May 2018 before the internal investigation against him concluded. Pam Bromley case The watchdog also examined the case of Pam Bromley, a Labour councillor in Rossendale, Lancashire. She made “numerous statements” on Facebook between April 2018 and December 2019 that the EHRC said amounted to “unwanted conduct related to Jewish ethnicity” and “had the effect of harassing Labour party members”. On 15 December 2019, she posted on Facebook about Jeremy Corbyn: “My major criticism of him – his failure to repel the fake accusations of antisemitism in the LP [Labour party] – may not be repeated as the accusations may probably now magically disappear, now capitalism has got what it wanted.” Bromley, who had been suspended from the party in April 2018, was expelled by Labour in February 2020. Inconsistent social media policy The EHRC said that of the 70 complaints of antisemitism it investigated, the vast majority – 59 – concerned social media. Labour also had a policy, although it was applied inconsistently, of not investigating complaints about likes or shares of antisemitic content on social media until “mid-2018”, the report said. That meant “repeated sharing of antisemitic material could have escaped investigation, even where it could have amounted to a breach of the party’s conduct rule or unlawful harassment or discrimination”. Labour “has now acknowledged that its policy was wrong”, the EHRC added. Borderline cases A further “18 more borderline harassment cases” were identified in the sample of 70 studied by the EHRC. But typically “there was not enough evidence to determine whether the Labour party was legally responsible” because, for example, the person was not an elected representative or candidate. These were cases involving social media posts that “diminished the scale or significance of the Holocaust” or “compared Israelis to Hitler or the Nazis”, or “referenced conspiracies about the Rothschilds and Jewish power and control” or “accused British Jews of greater loyalty to Israel than Britain”, among others. Cooperation with Labour The watchdog indicated that its relations with Labour were not always smooth as it worked through its investigation from its formal beginning in May 2019. It said that while Labour had said it was “keen to engage”, the EHRC “encountered a number of delays in receiving information”. “At times, we were seriously concerned about the party’s commitment to working with us and to dedicating enough resources to the matter,” the EHRC said, although this seems to have resolved itself after a meeting with the former general secretary, Jennie Formby, in November 2019.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1307,Labour in turmoil as Corbyn suspended in wake of antisemitism report,10/29/20,"Labour was plunged into turmoil after the party suspended Keir Starmer’s predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, in the wake of a damning report into antisemitism that found the party responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination. The decision to suspend Corbyn for saying the problem of antisemitism within Labour was “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media sent shockwaves through the party and led to rumours of a split.
Corbyn’s rebuff of criticism from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) put him at odds with his successor. Moments after Corbyn’s statement was released, Starmer spoke at a press conference where he said those who “pretend [antisemitism] is exaggerated or factional are part of the problem”. Corbyn is understood to have spoken to Starmer on Wednesday night, ahead of the report’s publication, and was reassured there was no plan to take action against him in light of its findings. That changed after Corbyn’s statement was released. There was an atmosphere of shock and dismay in Labour HQ after Corbyn’s statement was published shortly before 11am, according to party sources. “It was total disbelief that he would put that out,” one adviser said.
A senior Labour source said the deputy leader, Angela Rayner, spoke to Corbyn and his team and urged him to apologise and issue a clarification in a televised clip he recorded at lunchtime, but he did not do so. Labour announced his suspension at 1pm, with Corbyn finding out from a cameraman as he left a community centre in north London. It is understood that Corbyn did not intend to make his statement a direct challenge to Starmer despite suspicions among senior Labour figures that he was “goading Keir”. Corbyn condemned the “political intervention” and said he would “strongly contest” the action – but called for calm and urged supporters not to quit the party. Shadow cabinet ministers backed Starmer, with one describing it as the Labour leader’s Clause IV moment. In a broadcast clip released after his suspension, Corbyn urged his followers to “stay in the party” to fight for leftwing principles following the decision to suspend him. During the interview, Corbyn refused to retract his earlier statements, saying the “public perception” about how many members were under investigation for antisemitism was “very different” from the reality. Len McCluskey, leader of Labour’s single biggest donor, the Unite union, called the suspension a “grave injustice” and said it raised questions over Starmer’s involvement in disciplinary matters – a key topic of the EHRC investigation. Starmer’s team strongly deny the decision was his. McCluskey, whose union gives millions of pounds to the party each year, said it would “create chaos” within the party and in doing so compromise Labour’s chances of a general election victory. “A split party will be doomed to defeat,” he said. The decision to suspend was taken by Labour’s general secretary, David Evans, and chief whip, Nick Brown, and meant automatic withdrawal of the party whip, according to multiple sources.
Corbyn-supporting members of Labour’s national executive committee on Thursday evening confronted Evans over his decision to suspend the former leader and claimed that the decision could be legally challenged. One ally of Corbyn said: “In theory, the NEC could call an emergency meeting and get him back in.” One of the key criticisms of the EHRC report was of regular political interference in the complaints process by Corbyn’s office. “The general secretary has always had that power to act quickly. Keir had to keep away from it otherwise it goes against everything that has happened today,” a member of the party’s executive committee said.
Corbyn’s supporters believe the disciplinary process is flawed and that the Labour leader will be able to fight his suspension, intending to challenge the notion that Starmer had no role in the decision. Corbyn’s fate in the disciplinary process could take months to resolve. The party has been charged by the EHRC with setting up a new independent procedure to fairly resolve outstanding complaints. One shadow cabinet minister, who called it “a Clause IV moment for Keir”, added: “I hadn’t expected Keir to be so strong in criticising those who deny antisemitism. It was the obvious clap line for those in the party who have been worried about the issue. Once he’d said that, the party had little choice but to act.” Another senior Labour MP said Corbyn’s suspension had been inevitable given his response to the report: “Jeremy showed absolutely no contrition or acknowledgement of his role and the role of his staff and supporters in causing this tidal wave of antisemitism. Keir had no option. The bit where Jeremy says the problem was overstated for political reasons is just echoing antisemitic conspiracy theories.” The MP said that even without the statement, some sort of showdown with Corbyn would have probably taken place: “A line had to be drawn beneath this, and the report is pretty clear that his office, his staff, his general secretary meddled in these inquiries.” The EHRC report found Labour responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination over antisemitism. It cited “serious failings in the Labour party leadership in addressing antisemitism and an inadequate process for handling antisemitism complaints”. However, Corbyn said he had been obstructed by party officials in trying to tackle the issue. “One antisemite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media,” he said. “That combination hurt Jewish people and must never be repeated. My sincere hope is that relations with Jewish communities can be rebuilt and those fears overcome. While I do not accept all of its findings, I trust its recommendations will be swiftly implemented to help move on from this period.” Rayner said the former party leader had “an absolute blind spot” on appreciating the scale of the problem, adding that she was “deeply upset by the circumstances, and upset that Jeremy wasn’t able to see the pain that the Jewish community have gone through”. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said the mood at shadow cabinet on Thursday had been sombre. “It was not a decision anyone took any pleasure in, least of all Keir. I could not see any other reaction other than absolutely sadness.” She said that the party was closely monitoring Labour members’ and officials’ social media accounts over the coming days and would take action against any further antisemitism. “We will proactively investigate, we will not be passive about this, racism is a cancer, it is a poison,” she said. “Once it is allowed to enter an institution, it poisons everything that it touches, and so we are going to be proactive about this.” John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, described Corbyn’s suspension as “profoundly wrong”. “On the day we should all be moving forward and taking all steps to fight antisemitism, the suspension of Jeremy Corbyn is profoundly wrong,” he tweeted. “In [the] interests of party unity, let’s find a way of undoing and resolving this. I urge all party members to stay calm as that is the best way to support Jeremy and each other. Let’s all call upon the leadership to lift this suspension.” The grassroots pro-Corbyn group Momentum called the suspension “a massive attack on the left by the new leadership and should be immediately lifted in the interests of party unity”.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1308,"Labour responsible for harassment and discrimination, EHRC antisemitism inquiry finds",10/29/20,"The Labour party broke equalities law including harassment and discrimination over antisemitism in the party, an investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has found. In a long-awaited report, the EHRC said there were “serious failings in the Labour party leadership in addressing antisemitism and an inadequate process for handling antisemitism complaints”. It said Labour under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn was responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act, connected to harassment, political interference in antisemitism complaints and inadequate training for those handling the complaints. The EHRC’s lead investigator, Alasdair Henderson, said the failure of leadership must ultimately stop with Corbyn. “As the leader of the party at the time, and given the extent of the failings we found in the political interference within the leader of the opposition’s office, Jeremy Corbyn is ultimately accountable and responsible for what happened at that time,” Henderson said. The inquiry found that antisemitic comments by Ken Livingstone, the former London mayor, and Pam Bromley, a councillor in Rossendale, Lancashire, amounted to harassment of Jewish members under law, and this was “only the tip of the iceberg” of such behaviour.
The EHRC uncovered what it said was inappropriate interference in the complaints process over antisemitism by staff from Corbyn’s office, with 23 instances found, including staff exerting influence on decisions on areas such as member suspensions or whether to investigate claims. Some of these decisions were made “because of likely press interest rather than any formal criteria”, it said. While there was a wider culture of political interference in certain complaints, the report said this occurred more often in antisemitism cases, and was thus found to be discriminatory and unlawful. Henderson said the EHRC had faced significant obstruction under the previous leadership. “There were times in late summer, early autumn last year where we were seriously concerned about their commitments to work with us and had to push quite hard on them,” he told a briefing. He said the situation improved after a meeting with the then general secretary, Jennie Formby, but placed the blame for the report’s delay at Labour’s door. He said the obstruction was “very disappointing given the party’s stated zero tolerance of antisemitism and the initial commitment to working with us”. In response to the report, three of the UK’s main Jewish organisations – the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Jewish Leadership Council and the Community Security Trust – said in a joint statement the EHRC’s findings were “a damning verdict on what Labour did to Jews under Jeremy Corbyn and his allies”. Citing examples of poor practice in dealing with complaints about antisemitism, the EHRC said an email inbox for these “was largely left unmonitored for a number of years and no action taken on the majority of complaints forwarded to it”. Of 70 files reviewed for the inquiry, 62 had records missing. The inquiry found that this element of indirect discrimination against Jewish members – the lack of a proper complaints and disciplinary procedure – lasted until August 2020, four months into Keir Starmer’s tenure, but was now being addressed. The report details comments by Livingstone and Bromley that it says amounted to unlawful harassment because they were found to have antisemitic themes or suggested complaints about antisemitism were faked or smears. It notes that Bromley made repeated Facebook posts with antisemitic themes, for example defending references to the Rothschild banking group, and complaining about a “fog of fake accusations of antisemitism” and calling herself the victim of a “witch-hunt”. Complaints were made about her in May 2017, but Bromley was only suspended from the party in April 2018, a day after an article in the Times about her comments. On Livingstone and Bromley, the report says: “As these people were acting as agents of the Labour party, the Labour party was legally responsible for their conduct. In each case, the EHRC considered the perception of those affected by the conduct, and Labour party members told the EHRC that the comments contributed to a hostile environment for Jewish and non-Jewish members.” The EHRC said these two cases were “only the tip of the iceberg”, with 18 other instances where there was not enough evidence for a legal conclusion that the party was responsible for the conduct, covering councillors, candidates and constituency party officials. It said there were “many more files” showing evidence of antisemitic conduct by a member who did not have a party role, meaning Labour could not be deemed responsible for them. The report makes 11 recommendations, including an independent complaints process and clearer rules, an acknowledgment of the prior political interference and proper training for those involved in handling complaints. The joint statement from the three Jewish groups said the report “proves why British Jews were so distressed and it disgraces those who attacked us for speaking out against anti-Jewish racism”. The Jewish Labour Movement, which was among the groups that referred the party to the EHRC, said blame for what happened “lies firmly with those who held positions of leadership – those who possessed both power and influence to prevent the growth of anti-Jewish racism”. It said: “Antisemitism within the Labour party had serious consequences for many people, causing real emotional pain and despair to those who have given their lives to the Labour party. As the EHRC points out, it undermines confidence in our politics and the fabric of our democracy. “It will now be for the Labour party to set out how they intend to eradicate anti-Jewish racism from our party. This will in part be achieved by implementing the legally binding actions set out of the EHRC’s report in full and without delay.” Gideon Falter, the chief executive of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said: “The EHRC’s report utterly vindicates Britain’s Jews, who were accused of lying and exaggerating, acting as agents of another country and using their religion to ‘smear’ the Labour party.” Caroline Waters, the interim chair of the EHRC, said: “The Labour party made a commitment to zero tolerance for antisemitism. Our investigation has highlighted multiple areas where its approach and leadership to tackling antisemitism was insufficient. This is inexcusable and appeared to be a result of a lack of willingness to tackle antisemitism rather than an inability to do so.” The review was launched in 2019 after party whistleblowers alleged Labour was institutionally antisemitic in its handling of complaints, and within local party structures.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1309,Labour suspends Jeremy Corbyn over EHRC report comments,10/29/20,"Labour has suspended its former leader Jeremy Corbyn after he said antisemitism in the party was “overstated” following a damning report from the equality watchdog. The move is likely to ignite a civil war in the party between the leader, Keir Starmer, and Corbyn-supporting MPs. Corbyn condemned his suspension as a “political intervention” and said he would “strongly contest” the action. The suspension was provoked by a statement from Corbyn that rejected the overall conclusions of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report, saying the problem was “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media. That statement set the former Labour leader directly at odds with his successor. Moments after Corbyn’s statement was released, Starmer spoke at a press conference where he said those who “deny there is a problem are part of the problem … Those who pretend it is exaggerated or factional are part of the problem.” The decision to suspend Corbyn was taken by the party’s disciplinary unit, rather than Starmer, who saw the statement just moments before he was due to give a press conference on the report. Multiple Labour sources said there was a sense of shock in the headquarters at Corbyn’s statement. Asked about Corbyn’s response to the report, Starmer told reporters that he would “look carefully” at his predecessor’s comments. Two hours later, the party suspended Corbyn and withdrew the Labour whip. A Labour spokesman said: “In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation. He has also had the whip removed from the parliamentary Labour party.”
The EHRC report found Labour responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination over antisemitism. It cites “serious failings in the Labour party leadership in addressing antisemitism and an inadequate process for handling antisemitism complaints”. However, Corbyn said he had been obstructed by party officials in trying to tackle the issue. “One antisemite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media. “That combination hurt Jewish people and must never be repeated. My sincere hope is that relations with Jewish communities can be rebuilt and those fears overcome. While I do not accept all of its findings, I trust its recommendations will be swiftly implemented to help move on from this period.” After his suspension, Corbyn said he would “strongly contest the political intervention to suspend me” – suggesting he believed it was done on Starmer’s direct orders. “I’ve made absolutely clear those who deny there has been an antisemitism problem in the Labour party are wrong. I will continue to support a zero tolerance policy towards all forms of racism.” Labour’s former deputy leader Harriet Harman said Corbyn’s suspension was the right thing to do. “If you say that AS [antisemitism] exaggerated for factional reasons you minimise it and are, as Keir Starmer says, part of the problem,” she tweeted. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, who was promoted to the shadow cabinet under Corbyn, said the former party leader had “an absolute blind spot” on appreciating the scale of the problem. “I’m devastated that it’s come to this. Today should be about really listening, reading and taking in the report,” she said. Rayner rejected the idea that the issue had been exaggerated for partisan reasons, saying people should read the EHRC report: “I think that brings shame on us, and there’s no mitigation of that, and we have to acknowledge that and do something about it.” Rayner said she was “deeply, deeply upset by the circumstances, and upset that Jeremy wasn’t able to see the pain that the Jewish community have gone through. “Jeremy is a fully decent man, but as Margaret Hodge said, he has an absolute blind spot, and a denial, when it comes to these issues. And that’s devastating.”
John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, described Corbyn’s suspension as “profoundly wrong”. “On the day we should all be moving forward & taking all steps to fight anti-Semitism, the suspension of Jeremy Corbyn is profoundly wrong,” he tweeted. “In interests of party unity let’s find a way of undoing & resolving this. “I urge all party members to stay calm as that is the best way to support Jeremy and each other. Let’s all call upon the leadership to lift this suspension.” Before Corbyn’s suspension, Peter Mason, the national secretary of the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM), said Corbyn and Starmer’s words spoke for themselves and were clearly at odds. “Jeremy Corbyn does not have a future in the Labour party, he is yesterday’s man.”
Dame Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and JLM’s parliamentary chair, said Corbyn “sat at the centre of a party that enabled antisemitism to spread from the fringes to the mainstream”. Pressed on whether he should remain in the party or face action after his statement, Hodge said Corbyn was now irrelevant to the party. “There is an absolutely entrenched cultural challenge, and diverting it into somebody who is irrelevant in the Labour party today … it just doesn’t matter,” she said. “What matters are the commitments that Keir Starmer gave today. Jeremy is part of the past. I want to move on.” Corbyn said that when he took over as Labour leader in 2015, “the party’s processes for handling complaints were not fit for purpose”. He added: “Reform was then stalled by an obstructive party bureaucracy.” He argued that from 2018 the party’s new general secretary, Jennie Formby, and his officials “made substantial improvements, making it much easier and swifter to remove antisemites. My team acted to speed up, not hinder, the process.” He said: “Anyone claiming there is no antisemitism in the Labour party is wrong. Of course there is, as there is throughout society, and sometimes it is voiced by people who think of themselves as on the left. Jewish members of our party and the wider community were right to expect us to deal with it, and I regret that it took longer to deliver that change than it should.”",,Politics,Guardian,4
1310,Labour's left calls for Jeremy Corbyn's suspension to be lifted,10/29/20,"Labour’s left has called for Jeremy Corbyn to be swiftly reinstated, with a group representing more than 30 MPs declaring it would “work tirelessly” in support of the former leader until his case is resolved. Following his suspension on Thursday over comments about antisemitism, Corbyn convened a call with leaders from Unite and the Communication Workers Union, as well as supportive MPs, the party pressure group Momentum and other left affiliates. The group was divided over whether Corbyn’s suspension by Labour was premeditated but agreed to mobilise party members in support of him while also seeking conciliation with the party and its leader, Keir Starmer, to see whether an amicable way back for Corbyn could be found. If the party seem determined to press ahead with tough action, one source at the meeting said it could “get very big and very divisive very quickly”.
Momentum said it would “not take attacks on the left lying down” as it sought to rally Corbyn supporters. Key figures in parliament and the unions, however, downplayed talk of a party split. The Socialist Campaign Group, which comprises 33 Labour MPs, representing a sixth of the parliamentary party, released a short statement saying it “firmly opposed” Corbyn’s suspension, which followed his reaction to the publication of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report into antisemitism within Labour. John McDonnell, a longtime Corbyn ally, sought to strike a conciliatory note. Urging “all party members to stay calm” the former shadow chancellor said: “In the interests of party unity, let’s find a way of undoing and resolving this.” Few other MPs in the Socialist Campaign Group – normally Corbyn’s bedrock of support at Westminster – were willing to be publicly drawn into the row. Nadia Whittome, who was first elected in 2019, said she “unequivocally” supported the EHRC’s recommendations, in a lengthy statement that made no mention of Corbyn or his suspension. “It is vital that we learn from our mistakes and change our party for the better,” she said. One shadow cabinet member said: “I’d be surprised if any quit the party. Several members from all sides did that in the last parliament, and they all ended up losing their seats.” Insiders at Unite, the most significant Corbyn-supporting trade union, said they were “staggered” by the suspension decision. But Len McCluskey, the union’s general secretary, called on “members angered by this suspension not to leave the party” – in effect urging them to fight from within. The suspension, McCluskey said, was “an act of grave injustice”, which he argued would “create chaos within the party and in doing so compromise Labour’s chances of a general election victory. A split party will be doomed to defeat.” Dave Ward, the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said: “Keir Starmer’s political decision to suspend Jeremy Corbyn – a lifelong anti-racist campaigner – flies in the face of the report.” Labour’s left had been in retreat among the membership, as demonstrated by Starmer’s significant victory in the party’s leadership contest in April, with the leftwing candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey winning 28% of the vote. On Thursday it was unclear how far Corbyn’s suspension would galvanise them. Nevertheless, the “stand your ground” message was being widely shared by organisations such as Momentum. Its organisers said there had been “an explosive response” to an email from co-chairs Andrew Scattergood and Gaya Sriskanthan to its membership on Thursday lunchtime. “This suspension risks politicising Labour’s response to antisemitism. It is a massive attack on the left by the new leadership and should be immediately lifted in the interests of party unity,” the two wrote in their email. “They want us to give up. They want us to throw in the towel. They want us to feel despair. But we’re not going anywhere.” Momentum said it had called an emergency meeting of its national coordinating group to work out its response. One Momentum member wrote back saying Corbyn’s suspension had “shook me to the core” and that they had immediately considered resigning. “But as you say we must stand up and fight for the left and true socialism. I am dismayed to think that this may cause a civil war within the Labour party,” they wrote in an email shared with the Guardian. Donations to a fighting fund already set up by a Corbyn supporter to help pay for costs in a separate legal action soared on Thursday. It has raised about £350,000, which would easily be enough to afford the former leader experienced legal representation if required during any disciplinary proceedings.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1311,Large Covid outbreak in China linked to Xinjiang forced labour,10/29/20,"China’s largest coronavirus outbreak in months appears to have emerged in a factory in Xinjiang linked to forced labour and the government’s controversial policies towards Uighur residents. More than 180 cases of Covid-19 documented in the past week in Shufu county, in southern Xinjiang, can be traced back to a factory that was built in 2018 as part of government “poverty alleviation” efforts, a campaign that researchers and rights advocates describe as coercive. Under the initiative, Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in the far-western region are tracked and given work placements that they have little choice but to take up. An official in nearby Kashgar told Caixin that the plant, Shuchang Garment, was a “satellite factory” for producing clothing, curtains and bedding. Previous state media reports about the factory said it employed about 300 villagers, mostly women, who could earn as much as 90 yuan (about £10) a day.
“This is a village factory that is part of the scheme to put all adult Uighurs and related minorities into low-skilled factory work as part of poverty alleviation,” said Adrian Zenz, a researcher focused on Xinjiang who has analysed public documents and official language related to the programme. “Clearly, ‘industry-based poverty alleviation’ is not voluntary but mandatory. Those who resist being ‘alleviated’ from their poverty are subjected to ideological education so that their thinking aligns with the state’s goals,” he said. The outbreak in Shufu county is among the largest China has recorded in more than two months. On Wednesday officials said the flare-up had been contained and the factory sealed off. By Monday night 4.5 million people in the area had been tested. Authorities said there were 183 residents from the county now with the virus, three of whom were in critical condition while 138 patients were asymptomatic. Officials said the first case was a 17-year-old girl who worked at another local factory and who had eaten dinner with her parents at Shuchang. She was described as being from one of the nearby villages but lived in the factory dormitory and returned home every two weeks. Since the pandemic began in China late last year, rights advocates have worried about the possibility of the virus reaching crowded internment and re-education camps and prisons in Xinjiang. An outbreak in Urumqi, the capital, in August, prompted officials to swiftly enter a state of “wartime” lockdown. Tight controls on information coming out of the region have added to uncertainty as to the extent of the virus’s reach there. China’s policies in Xinjiang in the name of counter-terrorism have come under increased international criticism as witness accounts, satellite imagery, leaked official documents and other evidence have detailed mass detentions, surveillance and intimidation of Muslim minorities, most notably Uighur residents. Previous reports have documented the use of ex-detainees in factories, and the Shuchang factory is located about four miles from an active detention facility, according to a database compiled by Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) using satellite imagery and other sources. Researchers say that while it is possible ex-detainees are working in the factory, there is no evidence to suggest so. “The conditions likely amount to coerced labour, as the workers seem to live within a few hundred metres of their factory and yet are only allowed to go home once a fortnight,” said Nathan Ruser, a researcher with ASPI.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1312,Legal action taken against PM over refusal to investigate Kremlin meddling,10/29/20,"A cross-party group of MPs and peers including a former national security adviser are taking legal action against Boris Johnson over his government’s refusal to order an inquiry into Russian interference in UK elections. The group filed a claim in the high court in an attempt to force the prime minister to carry out an independent investigation or public inquiry. It is the first legal action of its kind over alleged national security failures.
The move follows the publication in July of the Russia report by parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC). It found that the government and its intelligence services had failed to investigate Kremlin meddling in the 2016 EU referendum vote – a “hot potato”, as the ISC put it. The ISC urged Downing Street to carry out a full inquiry and to put in place a legislative framework to prevent future interference by foreign states. No 10 turned down the request. It argues there is no evidence of successful disruption by Moscow. The parliamentarians are now seeking a judicial review. They argue that the government’s inaction breaches its obligation under article three, protocol one of the European convention on human rights. This requires genuinely free elections to take place. The high court claim names Johnson as defendant. It is being backed by Lord Peter Ricketts, the government’s first national security adviser between 2010-12 under David Cameron, and the former chair of the joint intelligence committee (JIC). In a witness statement, Ricketts said he was “very surprised” the government had not sought evidence over Russian interference in the Brexit vote, nor carried out “a post-referendum assessment of Russian attempts to influence elections in the UK”. He added: “Given the importance of knowing the extent of past Russian interference in assessing the risk for future elections, I do not understand why the government would choose not to investigate.” Ricketts said there was a “considerable and growing body of evidence” that Moscow had actively interfered in other western elections, including the 2016 US presidential election and France’s 2017 presidential vote. Ensuring the integrity of British elections was a key national security issue, he said. Six peers and MPs have joined the claim. They include the Lib Dem Lord Strasburger, cross-bencher Baroness Wheatcroft, Labour’s Ben Bradshaw and Chris Bryant, the Green MP Caroline Lucas and Alyn Smith, the SNP’s foreign affairs spokesperson. “The Russia report raised a series of deeply troubling questions,” Smith said. “We don’t know if the UK spy agencies were caught napping over Russian interference and didn’t take it seriously, or if the spooks were given tacit instruction [by politicians] not to look into this.”
Johnson refused to release the Russia report before last year’s general election. It found “credible evidence” the UK was a target for “political influence operations” and “disinformation campaigns” carried out by Vladimir Putin’s operatives. Details were hidden in a classified annex. Lord Strasburger described Lord Ricketts’ support for the action as “very significant”, stressing: “He was about as senior as it gets in the intelligence community and if he is worried about the government’s refusal to investigate, we all should be”. Baroness Wheatcroft, a former Conservative peer, called the government’s failure to investigate “shameful”. She said there was “no doubt that the internet has opened the way for widespread potential interference in the electoral process from malign forces and that Russia has tried to exploit that opportunity”. All the Citizens, a non-profit organisation, has joined the application. The government has 21 days to respond, with a hearing unlikely before spring.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1313,Man arrested after showering commuters with money from 30th-floor window,10/29/20,"Chinese police have arrested a man after he scattered a “heavenly rain of banknotes” on commuters from his apartment window while allegedly high on methamphetamine. Police said the 29-year-old was “in a trance” after taking drugs at his home on the 30th floor of a building in Chongqing, in south-western China, when he began throwing cash out of the window to the streets below. Local media reported the “heavenly rain of banknotes from the sky”, and a video of the 17 October incident has been viewed more than half a million times. The footage shows traffic slowed to a crawl, or completely stopped in some sections, as dozens of people left their cars or walked onto the busy road to catch the banknotes. Police were called and the man was taken into custody. The police said in a statement he had been detained for taking drugs and was under investigation and receiving treatment. In 2017, also in Chongqing, a woman walked into traffic throwing bank notes behind her, prompting a police officer to pick them up as he followed her. Local media reported she told police she threw the 16,000 yuan (US$2,300) because she was in a bad mood. Last year a man who threw 100,000 yuan into the air after having a bad day at work asked for people to return his money. Shishi city police in Fujian said the man’s actions caused a traffic jam and people fell over each other trying to grab the cash.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1314,Man arrested in Saudi Arabia after alleged knife attack at French consulate,10/29/20,"Saudi Arabian police have arrested a man outside the French consulate in Jeddah after he allegedly stabbed a guard, amid heightened anti-France sentiment across the Muslim world and apparent terrorist attacks in two French cities. The Saudi national used a “sharp tool” to injure the guard, who is receiving treatment in hospital, the Saudi Press Agency said. The attack was reported within hours of the killing of three people and injuring of several others in a church in Nice, and the shooting of a man who allegedly attacked police officers in Avignon. There is not yet an indication the incidents are coordinated. The French embassy in Riyadh released a statement confirming the incident. “The French consulate general in Jeddah this morning was subjected to a knife stabbing incident targeting a security guard – an employee of a private security company – and immediately the Saudi security forces arrested the perpetrator,” it said. “The security guard was taken to a hospital, and his health condition remains stable. “The embassy of France strongly condemns this vicious attack against a diplomatic facility,” the statement read, adding that the embassy “affirms its full support for the victim and expresses its confidence in the Saudi authorities to uncover the circumstances of the accident and ensure the security of French facilities and the French community in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia”. Anti-French sentiment has been high across many Muslim countries this week owing to the French president Emmanuel Macron’s perceived attacks on French Muslims and support for the right to caricature the prophet Muhammad.
Leaders of several Muslim-majority nations, state-affiliated and independent media outlets, and clerical establishments in several countries have called for boycotts against French products, and Paris issued a security warning for its citizens earlier this week. Tensions have been stoked by several incidents in the past month including the republication of cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad by the French satirical outlet Charlie Hebdo on the eve of a trial for alleged accomplices of the terrorists who attacked the magazine’s offices in 2015 as revenge for publishing the same images. Macron also made a speech in early October calling for the reform of French Islam and saying the religion was “in crisis” in many parts of the world. He acknowledged the pain caused by French colonialism in north Africa, but the speech was poorly received in the Muslim world. Tensions have sharply increased in the past fortnight after a young man of Chechen origin beheaded the teacher Samuel Paty, who had shown the Muhammad drawings to his classroom. The French president responded to the attack by posthumously awarding Paty the country’s highest honours and redoubling his campaign against what he calls “Islamist separatism”. He also defended the right of French citizens to freely express themselves including through cartooning. There have been protests against France this week in Baghdad and Dhaka, and France’s top diplomat in Tehran was summoned by Iranian authorities to lodge a protest against Macron’s conduct.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1315,Merkel heckled by German MPs as she defends second 'soft' Covid lockdown,10/29/20,"Angela Merkel said Germans had the chance to show Covid-19 “you have chosen the wrong host” as she defended her government’s second “soft” lockdown, to shouts and heckles in parliament. Citing an interview with the German science writer Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim, which she said reflected her own attitude towards the pandemic, the chancellor said: “If the virus could think, it would think … ‘I’ve got the perfect host here. These people live all over the planet. They are globally networked and are social creatures, they can’t live without social contacts. They have a hedonistic inclination, they like to party, it couldn’t be any better.’” Humanity’s response, Merkel said, should be: “No, virus, have you learnt nothing from evolution? We humans have shown again and again that we are damned good at adjusting to difficult circumstances. We’ll show you that you have chosen the wrong host.” “This winter is going to be tough, four long months,” she said as she concluded her speech. “But it will come to an end.” Merkel is facing strong criticism from opposition politicians and branches of industry over the new restrictions, which come into effect on Monday. Bars, restaurants, theatres, swimming pools and fitness studios will close until the end of November, and public gatherings will be limited to two households and up to 10 people.
Unnecessary travel is discouraged and hotels are advised not to host tourists. Schools, nurseries and shops, however, will stay open. Merkel said on Thursday morning that Germany was in a dramatic situation as it entered the winter. The number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care had doubled in the last 10 days, and hospitals would be overwhelmed within weeks unless further steps were taken to curb the spread of the virus, she said. Contact tracing operations in many parts of the country had broken down, with authorities unable to locate the origin of 75% of infections, she added. The new German restrictions are considerably less draconian than those announced by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Wednesday, but Merkel’s “wavebreaker” lockdown has been met with cries of despair, particularly from the hospitality sector. Owners of restaurants, bars and hotels, many of whom have invested in new technology to meet hygiene requirements, will be hit hard by the new closures, despite the finance ministry’s promises of new subsidies. Germany’s disease control agency has yet to show data to prove that establishments where guests comply with mask-wearing rules have driven the recent rise in infections, they complain. The far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and the Free Democratic party (FDP) led the charge against Merkel’s second lockdown in the Bundestag. “We consider Ms Merkel’s paralysing of the culture and gastronomy sector, practically the entire leisure life of our citizens, to be excessive and inappropriate,” said AfD’s co-leader Alexander Gauland. The Green party said it approved of the new measures, but accused the government of having underestimated the threat of a second wave in the summer.
Neither Gauland nor the FDP leader, Christian Lindner, offered concrete proposals for an alternative plan, in the knowledge that measures as drastic as closing schools would be likely to prove even more controversial. The lockdown measures introduced in March had broad public support, but the closure of schools and nurseries was widely criticised. Germany’s health and education ministersunveiled a study two weeks ago which they said had shown that nurseries were not drivers of the pandemic. A study by the Bonn Institute of Labor Economics (IZA) argues that reopening schools had also not led to an anticipated rise in infection rates. Merkel justified her decision to keep nurseries and schools open in November “with view to the supreme significance of education”. Germany’s disease control agency announced a record 16,774 new infections in the last 24 hours on Thursday, though for now the country’s infection rate is still considerably lower than in neighbouring countries such as France and Belgium.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1316,Most black British children report experiencing racism at school,10/29/20,"Seven out of 10 young black people in the UK have felt under pressure to change their hair in order to appear more professional in school or at work, according to a new survey. Research by YMCA among young people of black and mixed ethnicity found many felt they had to change to be accepted in society, prompting warnings that rigid school and workplace policies could result in “cultural erasure”. Asked about racism in education, more than nine out of 10 (95%) said they had witnessed racist language at school and almost half (49%) said they believed racism was the biggest barrier to academic attainment.
Adele Tondu, 19, is in her second year at university and a member of YMCA’s BAME youth advisory group, which led the research. She said: “The way most black children are brought up, as soon as you get into school you are taught you’re going to have to work twice as hard to get to where you want to go. “The school I went to was predominantly white. I had racial language used towards me multiple times when I was at school. I remember in year 7, it was few days into school, I got called a monkey by one of the boys. I told the teachers. He got a detention but nothing else happened.” In the workplace, almost four out of five (78%) reported experiencing the use of racist language and more than half (54%) believed bias or prejudice during the recruitment process – including against names on CVs – was the main barrier to employment. The YMCA poll of 550 16- to 30-year-olds also addressed concerns about the police. About two-thirds (64%) of those surveyed said they worried about being treated unfairly by the police, and more than half (54%) did not trust the police to act without prejudice and discrimination. Equality campaigners have become increasingly concerned in recent years about strict school policies on hair which have resulted in some black children being excluded. Participants in focus groups who contributed to the YMCA research said they felt they had to change the texture of their hair and the way it naturally grows in order to be accepted in school. “They shared their experiences of teachers suggesting that black afro-textured hair is ‘untidy’ and ‘needs to be brushed’, while young black men spoke of hair policies at school being ‘just another form of racism’ by not being inclusive of young black people,” the report says. Participants in the focus groups also felt they had been labelled as “unintelligent” and “aggressive” at school, resulting in higher rates of exclusion. Black Caribbean pupils are around three times more likely to be permanently excluded than white British pupils. The report, Young and Black: the Young Black Experience of Institutional Racism in the UK, described the findings as shocking and depressing. “The report highlights that this is not just the action of individuals but it is institutions themselves that are perpetuating a culture of prejudice, discrimination and exclusivity,” it says.
“What struck us most was the sheer level of acceptance but also exhaustion in the black community, for people so young to be so tainted by this. It is time those with a platform, resource and power did some heavy lifting to make society fairer.” Denise Hatton, chief executive of YMCA England and Wales, said: “It is shameful that young black people growing up in the UK continue to do so within a society that engulfs them with racist language and discriminatory attitudes. “We must listen to what young black people are saying right now, and create the fundamental and vital change they are crying out for in order to create a better present and a brighter future.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1317,"National lockdowns should be backup plan on Covid, says WHO envoy",10/29/20,"National lockdowns should be used only as a “reserve” measure to control coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization’s special envoy on Covid. Dr David Nabarro said “circuit breakers” should not be a “primary measure” for tackling the spread of Covid, as France prepares for its next national lockdown and Germany introduces tighter national measures. The UK government continues to say it will do “everything we can” to avoid a national lockdown, despite pressure from its own advisers to impose one. A leaked document produced by modellers on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) found that under a “reasonable worst-case scenario”, 85,000 people could die from a second Covid wave, and 356,000 people could be hospitalised. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Nabarro, a British doctor, suggested that while lockdown restrictions in the north of England appeared to be slowing the spread of the virus in some places, cases were rising in the south where household mixing is still allowed in many places. Local action in the north had led to “a sort of levelling up, and southern parts of the UK are speeding up,” said Nabarro. But he cautioned against a full national lockdown, describing it as “a very extreme restriction on economic and social life” that temporarily “freezes the virus in place”. He said: “You don’t want to use those as your primary, and I stress that, primary, means of containment. Because in the end living with the virus as a constant threat means maintaining the capacity to find people with the disease and isolating them.” Building a robust test, trace and isolate system must remain the priority for all governments, said Nabarro, “with lockdown still the reserve that you use to take the heat out of the system when things are really bad”. In media interviews on Thursday morning, the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, accepted that coronavirus rates were in a “bad place” all over the country but said the government was resisting calls for another national lockdown. He told Sky News: “We will continue with our localised but proportionate approach on taking action where the virus is strongest, but you can see from those figures that the virus is in a bad place in all parts of the country. “The approach of trying to bear down on it where it is most concentrated I think continues to be the best way forward because despite the fact the virus is rising across the country, it is very concentrated in some places nonetheless.” Dr Mike Tildesley, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick, who is on the committee that produced Sage’s worst-case scenario for the coming winter, said urgent action was needed to slow the spread of the virus. Stressing that the modelling was not a prediction but simply a way of working out what would be needed if things went very badly in the coming months, Tildesley said that on the current trajectory some areas had slightly higher caseloads than even the worst-case scenario. He told Today: “R is greater than 1 everywhere and if we don’t take urgent action, we are most likely to see that as we approach the festive period we are probably going to be in at least tier 2 pretty much everywhere in the country. So really we need to move away from these regional firefighting techniques to try to move to something more national.”",,Politics,Guardian,4
1318,"New Zealand house prices soar despite Covid recession, worsening affordability crisis",10/29/20,"New Zealand house prices have defied the Covid-19 recession and soared to record levels, prompting warnings that the hot property market will damage the country’s long-term economic wellbeing and widen inequality. New Zealand, which already had some of the most unaffordable housing in the world, saw median prices rise 11.1 % in the year to September, while the median price in Auckland reached nearly $1m (US$660,000). Prices rose 2.5% across the country in September compared with August. But while cheap loans and looser lending requirements designed to stimulate the economy during the pandemic have attracted investors back into the market, many fear that first-time buyers and lower-income groups will be increasingly left behind by the rise in prices.
Shamubeel Eaqub, an independent economist and author of Generation Rent, said mortgage lending was showing record growth and most of it was chasing existing houses, driving up the price. Investors have been given a big advantage after the requirement to have a 30% deposit to buy an existing house was removed, he said. The measure was aimed at encouraging investment in new houses to ease a chronic shortage but was lifted to stimulate the market during Covid-19. In some small towns, house prices have increased by 40% on the back of rental yields as high as 10%, says Eaqub. “It’s good for people who own houses but it’s terrible from an equity perspective,” he said. “For first-home buyers and young people, it gets further out of reach. This just worsens everything we have been experiencing for the last 30 years. The lot of Generation Rent has just got a lot worse.” First-time buyers who reason that if they can’t buy a house now they never will, are in the market, too. “And they are kind of right,” says Eaqub. The pandemic tipped New Zealand into a sharp recession with a record 12.2% fall in GDP in the quarter to September but the loosening of regulations on mortgage lending has aided the recovery and helped those still in work, Eaqub said. “There’s still nearly 75,000 who have lost their jobs, really tough for them but for the other more than 2 million workers things are pretty good.” According to the recent Demographia International survey, New Zealand has one of the most unaffordable housing markets in the world, and over the past decade homelessness has increased to more than 40,000, or 1 in 100 Kiwis. The United Nations has described the housing shortage as “a human rights crisis”. “They allowed the perfect storm, and that’s successive governments, UN special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, Leilani Farha told the Guardian during a visit to New Zealand this year. She was surprised that New Zealand had such entrenched issues with homelessness, housing affordability and poor-quality homes despite its progressive left-leaning government led by Jacinda Ardern. Farha visited an Auckland marae that has housed homeless families, cramped motels in the Hutt Valley, near Wellington used as emergency housing, and boarding houses she described as “deplorable”. Bernie Smith, the chief executive officer of charitable organisation Monte Cecilia Housing Trust, which houses homeless families in south Auckland says there is “no strategic plan in terms of making a difference … There’s a hell of a lot of money going into motels and transitional housing, but very little going into building homes”. The waiting list for state housing is at a record high at a time when the government has scaled back the flagship KiwiBuild programme started in 2018, after finding the target of 100,000 affordable homes in 10 years impossible to deliver. As of August, 602 KiwiBuild homes were built with a further 927 under construction. Though a far cry from the target, the government has built more homes than any other in recent decades.
Housing as an investment of choice for Kiwis has become too big to fail, says Eaqub. “No government really wants house prices to fall but they want them to be affordable to first-time buyers. You can’t do both.” Policies such as building more houses, freeing up land and infrastructure financing take years to deliver benefits, says Eaqub. David Schnauer, author of Covid: Catalyst for Change, said there were signs that the public’s mood was moving in favour of tackling the lack of affordability, citing a New Zealand Herald/Kantar poll this month which found 52% thought prices were too high. Though strongest among younger age groups, 46% of people older than 40 shared that view. Only 6% wanted prices to rise. Recent data indicated that the biggest lender behind the big four (Australian-owned) trading banks in New Zealand was “the bank of mum and dad”, said Schnauer. Both Schnauer and Eaqub said the Reserve Bank needed to change its “very narrow view” of what financial stability means. “They think it’s about banks not failing, rather than saying it’s about how much money is created in the economy?” Eaqub said. “Where does it go? Is it efficient and equitable?”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1319,Nice church attacker identified as 21-year-old Tunisian man,10/29/20,"The man who killed three people in a knife attack in a church in Nice on France’s Côte D’Azur on Thursday has been named as Brahim Aouissaoui, a 21-year-old Tunisian migrant. Aouissaoui arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa in late September, when authorities placed him in coronavirus quarantine before releasing him with an order to leave Italian territory. He arrived in France in early October, sources close to the investigation told the AFP news agency.
French authorities say Aouissaoui had no identity papers on him when police shot and wounded him after the attack, but was carrying a document giving his name from the Italian Red Cross. He had not made any demand for political asylum in France. Prosecutors in Sicily have confirmed to the Guardian that Aouissaoui arrived in Lampedusa on 20 September, then spent 14 days on a quarantine boat before being transferred to Bari on the mainland on 9 October.
The high number of arrivals from Tunisia means repatriation procedures from Italy are often delayed. Instead, Tunisians are frequently given an “exit slip”, requiring them to leave Italy within seven days. Aouissaoui had received such an order but, like many, travelled illegally to France. Sicilian prosecutors also confirmed that Aouissaoui had no papers with him and said that a picture of him released by the French police matched the one in their possession. According to magistrates, the “current and most probable hypothesis” is that he travelled to Lampedusa onboard a small vessel.
Europol said in a report earlier this year that there were no signs of systematic use of “irregular migration” by terrorist organisations. A UN committee of experts, however, said the arrest of nine Syrians, an Egyptian and a Turkmen in Cyprus in May 2020, all linked to either Isis or Al-Qaeda-affiliated groups, showed that potential terrorists could use illegal migration routes to reach Europe. Matteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right former interior minister, said that if reports Aouissaoui had landed in Lampedusa were confirmed, the current interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, should resign or be sacked.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1320,NSW stud owned by Gerry Harvey among those accused in parliament of sending racehorses to slaughter,10/29/20,"Billionaire Gerry Harvey has apologised after one of his studs sent ex-racehorses to a pet food factory for slaughter, a practice banned in New South Wales, vowing “it will never happen again”. Allegations aired in Victorian parliament just days before the Melbourne Cup suggest the slaughter of unwanted thoroughbreds is continuing in New South Wales, despite public revelations last year and the NSW racing industry introducing rules in 2017 to stop retired horses being sent to knackeries or abattoirs. Parliament heard allegations that thoroughbreds from a range of studs had been sent to two pet food factories for slaughter: Kankool Pet Foods and Highland Petfood, both in New South Wales. Victorian Animal Justice party MP Andy Meddick said that included “a number of racehorses” from the Broombee Stud, owned by Harvey, which had been sent to Highland.
Meddick said the allegations had been brought to his attention by activists with the Farm Transparency Project. “If you support horse racing this spring carnival, you are also supporting the wholesale slaughter of these majestic animals, who deserve so much better,” Meddick said. Harvey told the Guardian he had been in contact with his stud and confirmed that horses were sent to pet food factories. He said the horses were to be euthanised and had vet certificates stating they needed euthanasia. Harvey said he has now seen those certificates. But he said the stud was not aware that NSW rules – unlike in other states – forbid sending horses to knackeries even if they were about to be euthanised. Harvey said there was no malice or intent behind the stud’s actions and it was a mistake. “You end up unwittingly in a situation like this, not of your own making,” he said. “You could argue that I’m the boss so everything has to come back to me. I can’t argue with that, but I’ve got 20,000 people working for me across the world. All I can say is sorry it happened, it won’t happen again. I’ve talked to the bloke and that’s all I can say. I don’t think it’s a hanging offence for him under the circumstances.” Meddick also named Ambergate Stud at Scone as having breached the rule. Owner Kevin Drew told Guardian Australia he did send a broodmare to Kankool this year but said he sent her to be put down and burned in the incinerator, not used for pet food. “It was an aged animal, it was a mare which was in her late teens,” Drew said. “She had an illness… it wasn’t something that you would be able to retrain or ask someone else to look after and carry those vet expenses.” Drew said he was not able to have the mare euthanised and buried on his property because he lived in a water catchment. He also said the cost of burying a horse – which requires hiring a backhoe – was prohibitive. “It was the best thing for that mare that she was put down and incinerated in that way.” Binnia Performance Horses, also named in parliament, would not comment on the allegations. Ezy Care Foster Mares said they did not have any thoroughbreds on their property. Mark Taylor, the owner of Tamac Stud which was also named, told Guardian Australia he had “never” sent a racehorse to Kankool. He said his truck was used to transport some non-racehorses to the facility but those horses had to be put down for their own welfare. “It is not true,” Taylor said. “I have never sent a racehorse to an abattoir. It’s illegal … I don’t do that. I have a passion for recuperating horses and getting them rehomed, we do that because we love our horses.” Guardian Australia has attempted to contact two other studs named in parliament. Slaughtering racehorses is not illegal in Australia. But it is against the rules of Racing NSW, which stipulate that retired racehorses must be rehomed, not sent for slaughter. Breaching the rules can lead to fines, suspensions and disqualifications. Racing Victoria does not have an outright ban on sending horses to slaughter, arguing that would “drive the problem underground”. Instead, it is compulsory for owners and trainers to provide data on why a horse was retired and whether it died or was retrained. Meddick named 12 thoroughbreds that had been allegedly slaughtered at Kankool, including Bahrain, a mare that won its owners $32,250 in five races, Sunday Poet, a five-year-old gelding that won $37,420 and retired two years ago, and Tycoon Mar, which won $119,785 in its three-year career. Pending Decision, a 12-year-old chestnut mare that won its owners $7,215, was also allegedly killed at Kankool, as were thoroughbreds Lechery, Denman Dame, Domally Force, Anguilla, and Madame Frost, Meddick claimed. Three further unnamed thoroughbreds, one born in 2018, were allegedly killed at the same knackery, parliament heard. Meddick said the situation was no different in Victoria. “The industry across the country is equally responsible for their welfare and protection,” he said. “They have been given too many chances. They say they love their horses, yet they give them a bullet.” Racing NSW general manager of integrity, Marc van Gestel, said an investigation was underway into the allegations. “Racing NSW is also lobbying the NSW Government to make it a criminal offence in NSW for any thoroughbred horse to be sent to a knackery, even if they have been rehomed to persons outside of racing,” he said. “If Racing NSW’s investigations establish that any of those horses remained in the ownership of persons under [its] jurisdiction, Racing NSW will prosecute those persons for any breaches of its rules.” Racing NSW said one of the horses said to have been killed, Diambra, was found this week to be alive. Other horses had been rehomed to other persons and were outside Racing NSW’s jurisdiction, he said. Van Gestel said only three horses that were allegedly sent to a knackery between March and August were potentially in breach of the rules. “Considering that 2,035 horses are retired annually from the NSW racing industry, the figure of 3 is less than 1% of the retired NSW horse population for that period,” he said. “This figure demonstrates that Racing NSW’s Rules and programs are working to ensure ensuring that thoroughbreds are rehomed after racing.” In 2019, the ABC alleged widespread slaughter of NSW-bred racehorses for pet food and human consumption. The ABC investigation alleged an abattoir north of Brisbane had slaughtered 300 racehorses, which shared in $5m prize money, in just 22 days. The investigation also alleged racehorses were being sold to two pet food factories on the outskirts of Sydney. The broadcast was attacked as unfair and inaccurate by Racing NSW, which said it failed to take into account initiatives it had employed to improve welfare and track and rehome racehorses, including a program introduced in 2016 to track thoroughbreds from birth to retirement. “I note that Peter V’landys promised to stamp this out last year following the ABC 7.30 report. Yet here we still are,” Meddick told state parliament. V’landys, the chief executive of Racing NSW, is suing the ABC for defamation for its report, alleging the broadcast wrongly implied he and Racing NSW were responsible for the slaughter of retired racehorses in the Queensland abattoir. The ABC is defending the case. Racing Australia told a Senate inquiry that it did not know how many ex-racehorses were killed in knackeries and export abattoirs each year. The industry has expressed support for a horse tracking scheme, which is being considered by a national working group. There are also no public records on the number of horses killed in Australia for meat each year. The two abattoirs that kill for export are subject to animal welfare oversight from both Australian and EU officials, and exported a combined 2,600 tonnes of horsemeat a year. The average carcass weighs 300-350kg.
Knackeries are not subject to the same level of oversight because the meat is not sold for human consumption. The RSPCA has said that, in some cases, slaughter at a knackery or abattoir may be a more humane option for a horse than being neglected. The harness racing industry and Racing Victoria also told the Senate inquiry that animals which are injured or have behavioural issues, as well as economic and practical considerations around the difficulty of burying a horse, may result in a horse going to slaughter. Meddick told state parliament that the Kankool factory was also slaughtering standardbred horses using in harness racing. He alleged stock horses used in rodeos, miniature horses and ponies, and “any horse in between, along with sheep and lambs, cattle and calves, pigs and goats” were also slaughtered at the factory, which is not in itself a breach of any rules or laws. Meddick made no allegation of cruelty involving thoroughbreds. Racing NSW, and the various studs named in Victorian parliament have been contacted for comment.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1321,Opposition leaders allege fraud in Tanzanian elections,10/29/20,"Opposition leaders in Tanzania have accused authorities of stuffing ballot boxes to ensure victory for the ruling party in simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections. Despite sporadic violence in the run-up to the poll, tens of millions of people filed into polling stations without incident on Wednesday to cast their votes. Zitto Kabwe, the leader of the opposition Alliance for Change and Transparency (ACT-Wazalendo), said there were reports of fraud from constituencies across Tanzania, and party workers had found thousands of ballot papers and large numbers of returning officers’ statements of results that appeared to have been filled in before the vote. One bag was seized when it fell off a lorry. “It was not an election, and the people of Tanzania will pay the price. The international community should not recognise this election or the legitimacy of the government,” Kabwe told the Guardian. Tundu Lissu, the principal opposition candidate, issued a statement alleging “widespread irregularities in the form of preventing our polling agents from accessing polling stations” and “stuffed ballot boxes seized” in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital. “If this continues, mass democratic action will be the only option to protect the integrity of the election,” Lissu said. John Magufuli, one of Africa’s most controversial leaders, is seeking a second term as president. His brand of populist politics and promises of economic development have gained him a solid support base, especially in Tanzania’s vast rural areas. But the 60-year-old has been accused of mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic and repression of dissent. International campaign groups have raised concerns about media freedoms in Tanzania. Twitter reported that it had seen “some blocking and throttling” of its service before the election. “Internet shutdowns are hugely harmful and violate basic human rights,” the company said. There were also reports of disruption to WhatsApp, Instagram and Google, and efforts to block the use of VPN services too. The government has denied clamping down on critics, and its spokesman, Hassan Abbasi, said the elections were held under the supervision of the national electoral commission (NEC), which is supposed to be impartial. The opposition claims the NEC has systematically supported Magafuli and the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), which is sub-Saharan Africa’s longest-ruling party, by disqualifying its candidates or ordering them to pause campaigning. At least nine people were reported to have been shot dead by police in semi-autonomous Zanzibar on the eve of the polls. There are fears Magafuli will win sufficient support in parliamentary elections on the mainland and in Zanzibar to allow the two-term limit to be lifted, raising the possibility of him remaining in power for decades.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1322,Priti Patel refuses to rule out second Covid lockdown for England,10/29/20,"The home secretary, Priti Patel, has refused to rule out another national lockdown in England as more than 2.3 million people in West Yorkshire prepare to enter the strictest tier of restrictions on Monday. Nearly 11 million people in England will be living under the most severe lockdown restrictions next week following the announcement that Leeds and West Yorkshire are to come under tier 3. A further 21.6 million people will be under tier 2 restrictions after an earlier announcement that additional areas in the Midlands, parts of Yorkshire, Luton and Oxford are to move into tier 2. With 58% of England’s population now certain to be under localised restrictions, Downing Street faces mounting pressure to implement tougher or countrywide measures amid concern that the patchwork approach is failing. Research warned on Thursday that the pandemic had reached a “critical” stage across the country. Judith Blake, the leader of Leeds city council, announced that West Yorkshire would enter tier 3 from 12.01am on Monday after hospital admissions in parts of the region exceeded the peak of the first wave. She said: “This is a very difficult decision for us to take and we recognise the significant of the economic impact that it will have, but the virus is at a stage in which we need to take measures.”
It means pubs and bars that do not serve meals will close along with casinos, soft play areas, adult gaming centres, betting shops and car boot sales for at least 28 days. The region accounts for 2.3 million people, in Leeds, Bradford, Wakefield, Calderdale and Kirklees. Local authorities will receive a combined total of £59.3m from the government, the same proportion per capita that other tier 3 areas have received. According to the real estate adviser Altus Group, across West Yorkshire, 1,608 pubs and 53 wine bars will have to close unless they can operate as restaurants, while nine casinos and 176 betting shops will also have to close. Susan Hinchcliffe, the leader of Bradford council, immediately criticised the economic support offered by the government, saying ministers were “seriously underestimating” the damaging impact of the restrictions on businesses and jobs. “There is a ‘template’ of funding available from government to support these businesses but I do not think it will be enough. Neither were [the] government in the mood to give us more,” she said. Earlier on Thursday Birmingham council’s leader warned that tier 3 was “inevitable” for the city’s population of 1.1 million, but not yet imminent. A swathe of areas will move into tier 2, the government announced, meaning indoor social mixing between households is banned unless a support bubble has been formed. They are the East Riding of Yorkshire, Kingston upon Hull, north-east Lincolnshire and north Lincolnshire, with Dudley, Staffordshire, Telford and the Wrekin in the West Midlands also moving up. They are joined by Amber Valley, Bolsover, Derbyshire Dales, Derby city, south Derbyshire, the whole of High Peak and Charnwood in the east Midlands, as well as Luton and Oxford city further south.
Asked on Thursday whether she would rule out another national lockdown, Patel said: “Well, I think at this stage, of course we can rule nothing out because we are a government that is focused on making sure that we stop the spread of this virus, and also we protect public health. So we have been using, and we are using, and we will continue to use, every single means available to us to do exactly that.” Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she could not rule out a return to nationwide restrictions in the coming weeks. It comes as France is set to enter a second national lockdown on Friday to curb a second wave that the president, Emmanuel Macron, warned “will be harder than the first”. This week a leaked document produced by modellers on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said that under a “reasonable worst-case scenario”, 85,000 people across the UK could die in a second Covid wave, and 356,000 people could require hospital treatment. No 10 has resisted new nationwide restrictions, with the Conservative party facing pressure from its MPs over the economic consequences. Labour has called for a time-limited “circuit-breaker” lockdown after it emerged that ministers ignored Sage advice in support of one in September.
Ian Ward, the leader of Birmingham city council, said a move to tier 3 “would seem to be inevitable at some stage” given the rising infection rate and pressure on the region’s hospitals. Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, said that although tier 3 had not been confirmed, the region was in a “very serious” situation and the NHS was coming under “intense pressure”. He said: “This is not a sustainable situation and unless the rate of infection falls then we will have to take further action.” In Nottinghamshire, where England’s strictest measures will come into force on Friday, the county’s director of public health, Jonathan Gribbin, said hospital admissions had surpassed the peak of the first wave. The interim findings of the React-1 study from Imperial College London showed dramatic increases in infections across all areas, especially in the south, where the R number – the average number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to – has risen above 2. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, accepted that Covid rates were in a “bad place” all over the country but said the government would “continue with our localised but proportionate approach on taking action where the virus is strongest”. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “Boris Johnson should have used the school half-term to implement a time-limited circuit breaker to push infections down, fix test and trace and save lives.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1323,Remote Marshall Islands records its first coronavirus cases,10/29/20,"One of the last coronavirus-free sanctuaries in the world has been breached, with the US military importing two cases of Covid-19 into the remote Marshall Islands. The Marshalls had been one of the last nations on Earth – most of which are in the Pacific – without a single confirmed case of Covid-19. But the country’s chief secretary issued an alert on Wednesday night saying the country’s first border cases of the novel coronavirus had been identified in two workers on the US military base on Kwajalein Atoll.
The two cases – a 35-year-old woman and 46-year-old man, both of whom are asymptomatic – flew into Kwajalein Atoll direct from Honolulu. The two cases are not epidemiologically related and both remain in quarantine on the military base. The Marshalls national disaster committee said there was no threat of community transmission. “Members of the public are requested to remain calm and stay tuned for updates. “Because these are border cases and contained in strict quarantine this does not require a nationwide lockdown. Schools will continue, shops and businesses will remain open and government operations will continue until further notice.” The Marshalls closed its borders to all entries in March, but eased restrictions slightly in June to allow in some people, mostly US military base workers, subject to a three-week quarantine at the Kwajalein garrison. French and US military and police deployments to French Polynesia and Guam have also been the source of most of those countries’ Covid-19 outbreaks. In French Polynesia, there has been an alarming surge in cases. The territory has recorded 7200 cases, and 29 deaths, including three deaths in the last three days. Cases have increased by 41% in the last week, and are now over 300 a day.
On Guam, where America’s Andersen air base has been linked to a large number of cases, the memorial hospital is setting up a tent in the carpark to treat Covid patients, because its wards are overwhelmed. Patients are waiting more than three days for a bed to become available. Guam has recorded 4,466 cases and 76 deaths. The Pacific remains the least Covid-infected region on the planet, aided by remote geography and early and strict border closures. But Pacific economies, already fragile and having been cut off from the outside world for months, are suffering acutely. Globally, only the small and remote island nations and territories of Kiribati, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, Cook Islands, Niue, Norfolk Island, Tokelau and Vanuatu are believed to be still free of the virus.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1324,Rising Covid infections in England: how worried should we be?,10/29/20,"This week there has been a dramatic change in the number of deaths caused by coronavirus in England – with dire predictions for the winter ahead. So what’s going on? Last week, a report from Public Health England suggested new cases might be flattening off, but they now seem to be soaring: Why? The latest figures from PHE showed that in week 42, ending 18 October, there were 101,887 cases, compared with 91,501 cases reported the week before. This amounts to an 11% increase, compared to a 30% increase in the previous week, and a 76% increase in the week before that. These figures have been revised upwards since last week due to delays in turnaround time, but they appear to show the rise in new Covid-19 cases is slowing. But there are important factors to consider: while national capacity for testing has increased over time, local capacity varies, which could influence the trend in some results. In addition, the PHE data largely reflects people who have been tested for Covid because they had symptoms: surveys from the Office for National Statistics and the React-1 study by researchers at Imperial College London involve taking samples from randomly selected members of the public, meaning they are not affected by fluctuations in testing capacity, and pick up asymptomatic cases. Both of these studies focus on cases in the community – so do not include hospital data – but vary in participant numbers and timing of data collection. Models by the MRC Biostatistics Unit in Cambridge, meanwhile, use a number of existing datasets to model infections including those in hospitals and care homes. All of these studies contain levels of uncertainty, but they suggest new cases are rising in most, if not all, parts of the country. That message is backed up by data on Covid hospital admissions and deaths, which follow a similar, albeit delayed, trajectory compared with infections. Is there any evidence that the tiered system has slowed the rate of infections? According to Prof Steven Riley, a co-author of the React-1 study, there is evidence of a slowing in the uptick in new infections in the north-west while the epidemic may no longer be growing in the north-east – although prevalence remains high. That may suggest tier 3 restrictions are having some impact – but infections are rising in most parts of the country. Some reports have suggested the death rate will flatten out and not reach the peaks of the first wave, although more may die overall. What is the science behind that? Experts say it is perfectly possible that this may happen, with the second wave more prolonged than the first. One reason is that unlike the first wave, when there was a national lockdown, the tiered system means infections may continue to grow in regions below tier 3. They could end up escalating through the tiers, until they reach the highest level. At that point, restrictions may be tight enough to reduce R, but once restrictions are relaxed, infections could climb once more. The upshot is that the tier system could act rather like a thermostat, with incidence (and therefore deaths), ending up roughly steady. Has the R gone up significantly? Possibly. The MRC data suggests R is almost certainly above 1 in all parts of England, with the possible exception of London, although there has been a decrease in R over the past few weeks in most regions – but this is based on data that is, overall, less up to date than that of the React-1 study. The latter puts the R for England at 1.27-1.88, up from 1.05-1.27 two weeks ago. Riley said the React study found a small dip in R a few weeks ago, suggesting the difference may be down to time lags in data used by the MRC. “We only need small changes in the average behaviour to go from 1.1 to 1.6,” he said, adding that just an extra one or two risky contacts per person might make the difference. Importantly, R remains above 1 for most, if not all, of the country. That means new infections are growing. What’s the most reliable picture? How worried should we be? The ONS and React-1 surveys are the most reliable for a snapshot of the situation, while the daily PHE data is most up to date but prone to biases in sampling. To get a true picture of the situation, it is worth considering all the data, from the different infection studies to numbers for hospital admissions and deaths. But the outlook is very concerning. “From our data there is a very real threat to the hospital system across the UK over the next two months,” said Riley.

1325,Sassoon family collection of Jewish artefacts to be sold at auction,10/29/20,"An unparalleled collection of Judaica amassed by one of the greatest Jewish dynasties in the world and not seen in public for over a century is to be sold at auction. The trove of 68 items includes silver objects, Hebrew manuscripts and family artefacts collected by the Sassoon family. Some items date back to the 11th century, and they originate from countries from east Asia to western Europe. “The pieces in this sale are not just the personal holdings of one of the world’s great Jewish families, they are significant works of art, and tell an important story of Jewish patronage, collecting and scholarship,” said John Ward of Sotheby’s in New York, which is presenting the sale.
The highlight of Sassoon: A Golden Legacy is two silver Torah shields from the 18th century. According to Sotheby’s, the “superb jewel-like works of art” represent “the most important pieces of Judaic metalwork to appear at auction in a generation”. The shields – the work of Elimelekh Tzoref of Stanislav, a Jewish silversmith – are intricately engraved, depicting the carved wooden Torah arks of eastern European synagogues. On the back of one is a highly detailed plan of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. They were probably made in Lemberg (Lviv) in Ukraine, and are estimated to fetch up to $900,000 each. The sale also includes books and manuscripts, including a Siddur, or daily prayer book, owned and annotated by Rabbi Joseph Hayyim of Baghdad, who died in 1909. Two pairs of Tefillin – leather boxes and straps worn by Orthodox Jewish men on their head and arm during weekday morning prayer – owned by Rabbi Hayyim are estimated to fetch up to $250,000. The personal items in the sale reflect the “tastes, luxurious lifestyles and the international range of this legendary family”, Sotheby’s said. The ketubbah, or marriage contract, of the wedding between Reuben David Sassoon and Catherine Ezekial, a union of two of the greatest Baghdadi merchant families in India, is estimated at $10,000-$20,000. A magnificent silk robe worn at another Sassoon wedding and a signet ring are also for sale. The Sassoon family – known as the “Rothschilds of the east” – had its roots in Baghdad but relocated to India in the 1830s to build a vast trading empire, becoming one of the world’s wealthiest families. Its patriarch, David Sassoon, opened branches of his company in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Rangoon. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many members of the family moved to England, embedding in high society and engaging in philanthropy, politics and patronage of the arts.
Siegfried Sassoon, one of the foremost poets of the first world war, was David’s great-grandson. Another descendent, Rachel Sassoon Beer, became the first female editor of a national newspaper when she took the helm at the Observer in 1891. Sharon Liberman Mintz, senior consultant of books and manuscripts at Sotheby’s, said: “The distinguished pedigree, superior quality and historical importance of this collection leaves me breathless.” The silver shields were, she said, the most extraordinary objects she had ever encountered, and the sale meant the public would be able to see “these beautiful pieces” for the first time. The auction is due to take place on 17 December in New York.",,Foreign,Guardian,4

1343,An operational tsunami': preparing for a winter surge of Covid-19,10/30/20,"During the typical evening bustle of the critical care unit at University hospital, Coventry, two construction workers are hoisting temporary polythene walls into position, dividing the ward into two. Behind them, a young nurse wearing an unconventional mask – one which cloaks her entire head – is providing life-saving care to an unconscious patient. The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has hit the Midlands, with Coventry imposing tier 2 restrictions last week. Plans for a possible surge in admissions to University hospital are being swiftly implemented. “We’re in the midst of what I’d call an operational tsunami,” says Prof Kiran Patel, the chief medical officer.
Construction workers erect a partition wall in critical care while clinical staff attend to patients. All photographs by Jonny Weeks. “Winter looks like being a slow burn rather than a rapid acceleration,” says Patel in regards to coronavirus admissions. “But, at the same time, non-Covid activity levels in the hospital have risen back to normal. We’ve got a backlog of elective care [referrals including for surgery] and the tertiary sector is asking us for mutual aid and specialised support. So we’ve got a quadruple-pronged assault on our services which we’re trying to manage.” Patel says University Hospital Coventry & Warwickshire (UHCW) trust is approaching winter with a “battle rhythm” and recognises that with each passing day the challenge is becoming more acute. Worry Last Friday, the hospital had a total of 30 Covid-positive patients, six of them in critical care. Seven days later, those numbers had risen to 31 and 10 respectively.
Back in the spring, when the first wave of the pandemic peaked, the hospital had up to 32 Covid patients in ICU at any one point. Memories of that time are still fresh and a feeling of unease lingers for Dr Tom Billyard, a consultant in critical care. “I’m worried the health service has been a bit complacent over the summer. We’ve had time to prepare but actually I’m not sure we’ve used it very well. I don’t feel very prepared. “We normally struggle through winter, so to add more Covid patients on top of that is a big worry.”
Billyard says the expectation that hospitals should fulfil 90% of elective surgeries is particularly troublesome because it will prevent the large-scale redeployment of surgical staff that proved so helpful last time. “The problem isn’t UHCW,” he adds, “it’s the top-down message” from the government and local health authority. Covidology However, senior UHCW management says the trust is equipped for a long and taxing second wave. “We’ve learned a whole new speciality: ‘Covidology’,” says Chris Bassford, clinical lead in critical care. “We’ve learned that Cpap [non-invasive ventilation] works well and that if someone is intubated their outlook is a lot worse, so we now persist with Cpap a lot longer. “And we’ve learned that although we would normally run anyone with chest diseases on the drier side [keeping them slightly dehydrated, with a negative fluid balance], if they have Covid it’s better to run them a little wetter.” New safety protocols are also noticeable upon entering the Covid wards. Previously, medical staff would don an abundance of personal protective equipment to shield themselves from the virus, whereas many now wear disposable pinnies and work with bare arms.
Activities on ward 30, where treatment is given to Covid-positive patients who don’t require critical care.
“At first we saw the pictures of people in Korea wearing full E.T. spacesuits,” says Bassford, “and when we started getting patients here it was still two pairs of gloves, a gown, a pinny, an FFP3 mask and a visor. But there were unintended consequences: people found it harder to communicate and there were times – not many – where we passed the infection between patients. “That’s why you don’t see gowns so much now. It’s a lot easier to wash your hands and skin if you’re bare below the elbows. It’s safer so long as we’re meticulous with our hygiene.” But the past six months have proven that there is “no magic bullet” for the virus, says Billyard. The drugs remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine proved ineffective, while dexamethasone only helps to reduce mortality in critical care from 40% to 25%. “We’re still going to see a lot of people dying from this over winter,” Billyard says. “What gets patients better is good quality intensive care.” Bassford agrees. “You can have as many ventilators as you like but intensive care is not about the number of devices you’ve got. It is exactly what it says: it’s caring for people intensively. Caring is not a machine. It’s the staff who are at the bedside all of the time.” Surrogate family Tracy Newey, a healthcare assistant, was one of those redeployed to critical care in the spring. She says of her experience: “When I first went into critical care I was petrified because I’d never been in there before. I was used to dealing with surgical patients. The difference was massive. But the team showed us how to do things and now I love it. “We feed patients, wash them, roll them, talk to them, get them talking to their relatives with iPads, and we help with them emotionally. We’re like a surrogate family.” Carole Williams, a senior sister who oversees training of new recruits and redeployed staff, says: “In March, everyone came from everywhere to help us. But this time around we need to be slightly more selective about who we bring in. “We also have the issue that some of our staff are now self-isolating, so we’re struggling at the moment. But people are working full pelt and they’re absolutely brilliant.” Jill Ilsley, who has spent 33 years working in the NHS and is now responsible for forward-planning, is confident the trust can manage the demand. “We will cope. We will keep the beds open and we will staff them safely. It will work because it has to. We can’t say: ‘Oh, I’m sorry, we’re closed today.’”
Some medical staff, such as Wilhelmina Bulley and Sadie Orton, have just begun their medical careers in the middle of the pandemic. Bulley, a nurse who qualified in February, says: “[In three years of training], we never had an induction for a viral pandemic. So it was quite daunting to start the job at the same time as this happened. But comparing today to then, I feel more prepared, I know what’s happening and what to expect. I’m more positive.” One of her patients on ward 30, John Latham, looks sprightly. The 81-year-old praises those who have helped him beat the virus. “They’ve been so caring and efficient,” he says. But he adds that he has been lucky. “This disease makes you an old man. The recovery from Covid is going to be slow but I want to get home, get moving, get doing and get my life back.”
John Latham, a patient who is recovering from Covid-19. Mental health The pressure of saving – and losing – lives has taken its toll on staff. Rob Green, a consultant in critical care, says he is still recovering from the mental toil of the first wave. “I’ve been through Schwartz Rounds [mental health forums for healthcare workers] and I just couldn’t bring myself to talk about Covid,” he says. “The first wave was overwhelming and I think I’m still trying to decompress from it.
“We train for mass casualties, and for chemical and biological events with large numbers of patients over a short timescale, but nothing like this.” Green caught Covid in May. It was a distressing experience, he says, “because I had spent weeks telling people on wards that they had a disease for which there is no cure, then I was in that position myself”. There was a trivial positive to come from his own recovery, he says: he has been allowed to regrow his facial hair. “I had a beard for years and I’d always been FFP3 mask-tested with my beard [tight-fitting masks are mandatory in critical care], so when Covid happened I said: ‘I don’t need to be clean shaven to wear a mask.’ But the trust said: ‘No, no, no’, so I shaved my beard off and grew the most magnificent moustache instead, like Joe Exotic on Tiger King. Then I got coronavirus anyway.”
Invisible threat On ward 30, Dr Asad Ali, a consultant physician and de facto lead in respiratory medicine, is checking a patient who has participated in plasma trials. He sympathises with the experiences of people around the country because he, too, has been personally affected by Covid. Ali flew to Pakistan to visit his ill parents early in the first wave. While he was away, his brother in the UK became seriously ill with Covid. “I got stranded overseas and had to arrange the ambulance for my brother while sitting 5,000 miles away,” he says. “I was frantically trying to get flights back from Lahore, to no avail. I booked four or five flights and they all got cancelled. When I finally flew into Heathrow, I found a new country.”
Dr Asad Ali examines an unidentified patient who has participated in plasma trials. Ali acknowledges the sacrifices made by the public in the first wave of the pandemic and is calling on the NHS to “empower” them using hard-hitting messaging. “We don’t need to say ‘protect the NHS’; we need to say ‘protect the public’,” he says. “If a person doesn’t see how it will affect them directly and none of their family members have got it, how long are they going to be willing to make sacrifices? “We need to show them. They need to know the virus doesn’t discriminate. We need patients who’ve come out of intensive care and clinicians from hospitals to be part of the messaging. We need to say: this is how it impacted us, it can impact you or your loved ones too.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1344,It's possible': the race to approve a Covid vaccine by Christmas,10/30/20,"The race for a Covid vaccine is reaching a crucial stage, with the glimmer of a possibility that one of the leading contenders will be approved by Christmas. In an interview with the Guardian, Kate Bingham, who heads the UK’s vaccine taskforce, said the UK was in “a very good place”. But there are still hurdles to clear in the coming weeks. The Guardian’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, explains the challenges ahead. The frontrunners
Within weeks, the first results to show whether one of the vaccines actually works will emerge. With a vaccine hailed as the world’s best hope of halting the deaths and the social and economic destruction wreaked by the Covid pandemic, the world is holding its breath. It could be Oxford University, partnered with drug company AstraZeneca. It could be Moderna in the US. Or it could be Pfizer and the German company BioNTech. All three have either recruited the last of the tens of thousands of volunteers they need for the critical final trials or will shortly do so. And sometime in November or December, their independent monitoring boards will “unblind” their secret data to find out whether fewer people given the experimental vaccines are getting Covid-19. The excitement is palpable. Bingham understands that. “I can just see that it’s such an incredibly sensitive topic, that everyone is so desperate to be out of lockdown and get back to normal that everyone grabs at straws,” she said. “I think my key message is we’re in a very good place. The UK is well set up, we’ve got a very attractive portfolio. We are absolutely well-planned and well-organised in terms of having the right vaccines and knowing when they’re arriving.” The UK has bought six of the hundreds of vaccines under development. It has two of the three companies heading down the final furlong – AstraZeneca’s and Pfizer’s. Bingham says she thinks there is a chance of a vaccine before Christmas. “They have to have enough cases to show vaccine efficacy and the regulator has to approve it. If all of that happens, then it’s possible that we could have a vaccine this side of Christmas,” she said. “But, you know, I’ve called it a slim chance and I think it is a slim chance. I think we’ve got a better chance of generating that data early next year, but it’s not to say it’s impossible.” It all turns on the … Phase three trials In these final trials, recruiting up to 50,000 people, half get the experimental vaccine and half get something else. The trial is blinded. Nobody knows who has had what. The codes for the vaccine allocation are held on secret computer files until enough people taking part in the trials have become infected with the coronavirus. Then independent experts will look to see which drug they had. The hope will be that most, if not all, of the people with Covid-19 will not have had the coronavirus vaccine. Although volunteers are told how to reduce their own risk and may live in areas with low infection rates, this interim analysis could come quite quickly. This is because the three companies have said they will start looking at the data when the infection sample sizes are still quite small. Moderna has stated it will take a first look when it has 53 cases of coronavirus infection among participants in the trial, and again at 106. AstraZeneca has said it will look when there are 75. Pfizer is waiting for only 32 and will look again at 62, 92 and 120 infections. They have largely been expected to declare first. Originally they planned to look in September. CEO Albert Bourla was ambitious to have a vaccine by October – exciting Donald Trump among others, who thought it could be ready before the US presidential election. But the timescale has slipped. On Tuesday, Pfizer said it hasn’t looked yet – which probably means there have not been enough infections. And there is now a further delay because the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, has upped the safety stakes in the wake of the pausing of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca trial in which two people separately fell ill. The FDA has said it will not consider giving emergency approval to any vaccine unless there is safety data in at least half the participants for two months after the last dose is given. That means Pfizer could not submit before the end of November. A one-shot wonder? Unfortunately not Expectations of what the first vaccine will do are probably way too high. It will not end the pandemic. But there may well be something that crosses the line imposed by the regulatory bodies. To be approved, it needs to be at least 50% effective. And it must be safe. Everybody agrees that cutting corners for speed could lead to disaster. Dr Nick Jackson, from CEPI, the coalition on epidemic preparedness, which is supporting global vaccine development and has nine vaccines in its portfolio so far, says even when we have vaccines in use, safety will still have to be monitored. He cites Maurice Hilleman, the famous microbiologist who was involved in developing 40 vaccines. “Hilleman said many years ago, he only breathes a sigh of relief when the third billionth dose has been given. So the continuous monitoring for safety after these initial licenses is also going to be absolutely paramount,” he said. CEPI has slightly different criteria for frontrunners. Along with speed, scale of manufacturing and access are vital too, so that all countries can get what they need to vaccinate those most at risk, said Jackson, who is head of programmes and innovative technology in CEPI’s vaccine R&D team. “I think today, arguably AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Novavax are frontrunners, but we do recognise that there are others close behind. And we mustn’t forget that China also has some significant efforts. Sinovac is a very good example of a company with a vaccine that hits some criteria and is not far behind those frontrunners.” Novavax, which is another of the six in Bingham’s UK portfolio and is now in phase three UK trials, has been “very, very active from a manufacturing perspective, not only in the United States, but also in other places around the world such as India, South Korea, in Prague and in Japan”. “So they should be in a position in 2021 to provide potentially up to 2bn doses. That’s a really significant contribution towards public health,” said Jackson. AstraZeneca is working to produce up to 3bn doses around the world. Both companies have done a deal, for instance, with the Serum Institute of India, which can manufacture at scale for developing countries. The commercial risks involved in starting to manufacture billions of doses of a vaccine which may turn out to be dud are obvious. But in this crisis, there is no room for that sort of caution. Jackson says the global involvement has been phenomenal. “I still am amazed at the number myself – 184 economies signed up to purchase or are eligible for vaccines from Covax, which is only comparable, I think, to the Paris climate agreement in terms of economic powers signing up for a particular initiative,” he said. At the beginning of the year, they looked carefully at all the possible ways vaccine development could be speeded up, he said. “We predicted it would be 12 to 18 months for vaccines to be available, and we do view that target as still being valid in the first half of 2021,” he said. That’s when they expect emergency licences to be in place and volumes of vaccine to be released that will allow the desperately needed immunisation campaigns to begin around the world.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1345,"No predators, plenty to eat': New Zealand struggles with plague of peacocks",10/30/20,"A bird renowned around the world for its beauty has showed its ugly side by causing havoc on farms in New Zealand; eating crops, evading control efforts and driving landowners to distraction. The jade and green peafowl, commonly known as the peacock, has become naturalised in New Zealand after what New Zealand Birds Online calls “benign neglect of birds kept for display”. Preferring rugged and wild habitats, the peafowl has spread extensively around the warmer regions of the North Island, according to the Ornithological Society of New Zealand, and has also been recorded as far south as Christchurch and Dunedin.
But as the numbers of their natural predators such as possums, ferrets, stoats and rats drop due to nationwide control efforts, peacocks are becoming increasingly destructive. Many local farmers have also unwittingly planted feasts for peacocks; seeding fields of maize, corn and clover which is beloved by the animals. Farming accounts for around 5% of New Zealand’s gross domestic product. “They weren’t a problem at all when there were plenty of predators around, but now they’ve got hardly any predators and plenty to eat,” said Wanganui farmer Grant Adkins, a spokesperson for Federated Farmers in the region. “They love rye grass and clover. They’re happy to wander around and eat all the fresh, green shoots of all our pastures and crops – they do very nicely.” Adkins estimates the number of peafowl is in the thousands in his district, and says authorities have shown no interest in controlling their numbers; focusing instead on targeting pests like possums and rats. According to NZ Birds Online, other large sightings include up to 100 birds spotted in a field at Orere Point, in April 2011, and more than 100 near Otane in the central Hawke’s Bay in June 2016. Farmers have tried to manage growing numbers by shooting the birds, but the task is difficult as the birds are clever and known to be “very wary in feral populations”.
No poisons have been certified for the specific use of peacocks. Once shot at by farmers, they learn to keep their distance. “Over a 12-year period, their numbers have increased hugely and they are spreading further and further afield,” says Adkins. “There are thousands in the district. On the flats of my neighbours, I can see a group of 150 in one go, eating a lot of grass. The amount of feed they’re eating is feed our livestock can’t eat.” ‘They’re like blimmin’ road runners’ Tony Beauchamp, an ornithologist, says New Zealand’s feral peacocks are a rare phenomenon globally, as the birds mainly live on the Indian subcontinent. Knowledge about peacocks in New Zealand is scant, with the birds preferring to live in wild and remote regions of the country, and the government’s conservation efforts firmly focused on protecting native species. “Most people in New Zealand ignore introduced birds, it’s a New Zealand thing,” says Beauchamp. “I think a lot of our farm management practices are encouraging higher numbers of certain introduced birds. In Northland, farmers have been planting maize for stock feed. But maize is absolutely dynamite for pest birds, they love moving into it.” Beauchamp says ornithologists only began studying native birds with gusto in the 1960 and 1970s, meaning the country is “still playing catch-up” in its bird knowledge, perhaps leading to oversights in the study of introduced species. “I am not sure [peacocks] are very well understood,” says Beauchamp. The New Zealand government has committed to completely eradicating invasive species such as rats, stoats and possums by 2050. Trapping the unwanted species has become a mainstream hobby in New Zealand, helped by possum fur being valued in the fashion industry. But as possum numbers drop, Adkins says peacock numbers have boomed. Possums, ferrets, stoats and rats often eat the eggs of peacocks, which build nests on the ground. “They’re pretty smart, as soon as one starts to move, they all run, they’re like blimmin’ road runners,” says Adkins. “And once they’ve learnt they’re being shot at, you won’t get within two or three hundred metres of them.” Beauchamp agreed that peafowl in the wild were “extremely wary” and will keep a distance of 500 metres if they sense a threat. Rod Smillie, Horizon regional council’s biodiversity, biosecurity and partnerships manager, said he was “aware” of a population of wild peacocks in the region. “Peacocks do cause damage to pasture and crops,” Smillie said in a statement but added they were not included in the council’s pest management plan, which would be reviewed in 2027. A spokesperson for the department of conservation based in Whakatāne said peafowl were “not a significant conservation issue”. In the South Island, there have been isolated reports of peafowl escaping home enclosures, and Adkins is worried that left unchecked, the birds will spread around the country.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1346,Tell my children I love them': the victims of the Nice attack,10/30/20,"Victims of the Nice terror attack include a father of two who had worked at the Notre-Dame basilica welcoming worshippers and a mother of three from Brazil who had lived in France for decades. Vincent Loqués, 55, had his throat cut by the alleged attacker – named as 21-year-old Brahim Aouissaoui - and his body was found inside the church. Loqués was a devout Catholic and had been sexton at the basilica where he prepared the sacraments and altar for the mass for 10 years. His role was also to welcome visitors and worshippers to the basilica when it opened at 8.30am. Laura Male, a parishioner of the Notre-Dame church, said: “I’m so shocked. I still imagine him, I still see him walking, lighting the candles. And now I’m thinking: ‘He’s not there any more.’” Her sister, Laura, added: “We’re always with him. He’s always there, he spends the day there. He shares his life here. He’s not someone who comes and goes. This is his home, he’s here all day.”
Brazilian media named another victim as mother of three Simone Barreto Silva. Silva was stabbed several times inside the basilica. Severely injured, she managed to flee the building before collapsing in a nearby bar. She told those who were treating her: “Tell my children I love them” before dying at the scene. Silva, originally from Salvador on Brazil’s Atlantic coast, had lived in Paris for 30 years. “The Brazilian government regretfully announces that one of the fatalities was a 44-year-old Brazilian mother of three children, living in France,” a statement from the foreign ministry said. It did not confirm whether she also had French nationality. The third victim has not been named. She was a 60-year-old woman who had gone to the Notre-Dame basilica early Thursday morning to pray when she was brutally attacked inside the church. Police sources said she had her throat deeply cut and the killer appeared “determined to decapitate her”.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1347,A Covid Christmas: tiny turkeys and rule of six carol concerts,10/30/20,"The debate over Christmas and what it may look like in these extraordinary coronavirus times, is well under way. Here are some insights into a holiday season that is expected to be unlike any in living memory. Santa staying at ho ho home In a normal year, Ray Hulse would be gearing up for his busiest time of year, brushing the knots out of his “magic beard”, digging out his jingle boots and checking the fairy lights in his mobile grotto are still working. But in 2020, Britain’s “longest-serving Santa” – who first donned his red corduroy suit and cape in 1962 – will largely be staying at home in Shropshire. For the past 58 years, the former miner has spent most of December splitting his time between Shrewsbury Morrison’s and Bridgnorth’s Sainsbury’s and a few local churches, raising money for Hope House, a charity for terminally ill children. He normally lets children give him a cuddle and sit on his knee – “only if their parents are there and lift them on to my lap” – and rummage around in a stocking for a lolly, but not this year. There will be no cradling newborns for photos in front of his special neon heart, which reads “my first Christmas with Santa”. No special guest appearances for the Christmas lights switch on at Oswestry.
He is still hoping to make a few socially distant appearances but is sad that Covid will deprive many children of their chance to meet Father Christmas up close. “We can send people to the moon so why can’t we hurry up and get a vaccine?” he asked. Rule of six carol concerts?
Nick Baines, the bishop of Leeds, describes the government’s handling of the pandemic as “a masterclass in how not to organise and how not to communicate”. But whether or not there is a national lockdown, he believes Britons need to be realistic that Christmas 2020 is not going to be anything like normal. “You can’t argue with reality. And the reality is that we can’t mix,” he said.
The three cathedrals in his diocese are having to look at Christmas in “completely different ways,” said Baines. Currently, even in tier 3 areas such as West Yorkshire, churches can open from next week. But whether that will be true come Christmas remains to be seen. There will almost certainly be no carol concerts, Baines said, suggesting churches may instead encourage carollers to go out into the community in groups of six. A pared-down Christmas may be just the ticket for remembering the original Christmas story, he said. “We talk about there being no room at the inn. We talk about inhospitable environment and yet the light shines in the darkness and the darkness will not put it out. Christmas didn’t begin in Debenhams or Marks and Spencer but in an obscure part of the Roman empire when life was very cheap.” Tiny turkeys
Britain’s turkey farmers started thinking about Christmas back in spring, when the chances of life returning to normal by autumn felt realistic. It hasn’t panned out that way, of course, and farms are having to adapt for what most accept will be reduced demand for the largest birds. If the current “rule of six” stays in place in England, even in the lowest-risk areas no more than half a dozen people from different households will be able to share a Christmas dinner. One south Wales farmer, who normally rears 70,000 turkeys a year, suggested he could put his turkeys on a diet or slaughter them a bit earlier than usual to stop them getting too plump. Nick Davis, from Usk Vale Poultry, told the Sunday Times: “We have to decide what size people want and you can’t even tell me today what size that might be. We can play around with rations a bit, and we can slaughter them a week or 10 days earlier, so we can reduce the size to a certain extent.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1348,Brazil names Nice knife attack victim as Simone Barreto Silva,10/30/20,"The 44-year old victim of the Nice knife attack who told paramedics “tell my children I love them” as she died of stab wounds has been named Simone Barreto Silva, who worked as a carer for elderly people. Silva, who was born in the Brazilian state of Bahia, was a citizen of France, where she had reportedly lived for about 30 years. Grieving friends in Nice said the single mother and trained chef was “always smiling” and a “bonne vivante”. Myriam Touil, a close friend, told BFMTV: “She was a brave, generous, devout woman but also tolerant. If someone wanted to attack a symbol of joie de vivre, they could not have found better.” In a statement the Brazilian foreign ministry said it lamented and condemned “this heinous attack” and was offering support to her family. “President Jair Bolsonaro, in the name of the whole Brazilian nation, offers his profound sympathies to relatives and friends of the murdered citizen, as well as the other victims, and solidarity to the people and government of France,” it said. Friends and relatives paid tribute to Silva, who had three children, on social media. “May God protect your soul up there in heaven,” one cousin wrote. “You were a woman so full of dreams and vitality.”
In a broadcast on Thursday night, Brazil’s far-right president called the killing an act of “Christianophobia”. “She was there praying and this bloke who hates Christians came in. When we talk about Christianophobia this is what we mean … we have to fight this, and not with flowers,” Jair Bolsonaro said, according to the Correio Braziliense newspaper. Silva reportedly died in a restaurant opposite the basilica where she had taken shelter after running from the building with fatal injuries. Radio France Internationale (RFI) reported that one of the last things she said before dying was: “Tell my children I love them.” The Brazilian newspaper O Globo said Silva had been born and raised in Salvador, a city in north-eastern Brazil where the majority of citizens are of African descent. RFI said the victim had also worked as a cultural activist in Nice, helping to organise a festival paying tribute to the Afro-Brazilian sea goddess Iemanjá. Brazil’s foreign ministry said it was committed to eradicating the “scourge” of terrorism. Another victim of the attack, Vincent Loquès, 55, had his throat cut by the attacker. His body was found inside the church.
Loquès, who had two daughters, was a devout Catholic and had been sexton at the basilica where he prepared the sacraments and altar for the mass for 10 years. His role was also to welcome visitors and worshippers to the basilica when it opened each morning. He was described as a calm person who had spent his life “serving the church”. Laura Male, a parishioner of the Notre-Dame basilica, said: “I’m so shocked. I still imagine him, I still see him walking, lighting the candles. And now I’m thinking: ‘He’s not there any more.’” Her sister added: “We’re always with him. He’s always there, he spends the day there. He shares his life here. He’s not someone who comes and goes. This is his home, he’s here all day.” The third victim, a 60-year-old woman who was the to be first killed – allegedly by 21-year-old Brahim Aouissaoui – has not been named. She had gone to Notre-Dame basilica early on Thursday to pray when she was attacked inside the church. France’s anti-terrorist prosecutor, Jean-François Ricard, said her throat was “cut so deeply as to be a kind of decapitation”.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1349,Brazil's Trump takes to Amazon campaign trail but is backing Biden,10/30/20,"“I’d vote Biden,” Trump said as he pondered Tuesday’s era-shaping election. Not the real Donald Trump, of course, but his South American namesake – a 49-year-old politician from Brazil’s Amazon who is running for office using the name of a US president he reviles.
Miguel Simões Leal said he had adopted the alias “Trump” for his campaign to become a city councillor because of a physical resemblance to the rightwing populist. “I’m a bit chubby, 100kg or so. I look a bit like him – although my hair’s real,” explained the yellow-maned politician from the northern city of Macapá. But Leal – whose gambit is part of a time-honored Brazilian tradition designed to draw in votes – said the similarities ended there. “He’s an egotistical guy. The things he says, the way he acts, that absolute imperialism,” he said of the true Trump. “I don’t preach the same religion,” Leal insisted. “I’m the Good Trump … I don’t like nastiness, I like peace.” Leal isn’t the only one hoping an association with the US leader will boost their chances in Brazil’s 15 November municipal elections. In São Paulo the candidate Ronaldo Oliveira has registered under the nickname “Ronald Trump”. Further south in Santa Catarina another contender is using the moniker “Donald Trump Bolsonaro” – a double tribute to the US president and his far-right Brazilian counterpart and fan Jair Bolsonaro. João Sá Teles Santana told the Folha de São Paulo he was a “conservative patriot” with an ideological affinity to both. But nabbing their names was mostly a PR strategy. “I want free publicity,” the 59-year-old admitted.
In the southern city of Lages, one would-be councillor is running under the name of one of Trump’s Republican predecessors, although Juliano Nixon insisted that was in fact his actual name. “My mum told me he came to Brazil once and she thought it was a beautiful name,” said the 28-year-old candidate for the Socialism and Liberty party. Brazil’s Nixon, a professional referee and committed leftist, said it was his “life mission” to reclaim and redeem the name he owed to the disgraced Republican. “My aim is to do the exact opposite of everything the previous Nixon did. If he did it this way, I’ll do something different,” said Nixon, who supports Black Lives Matter and helped organize the first LGBT pride day in his profoundly conservative home town, where nearly 75% of voters backed Bolsonaro in the 2018 election. In Macapá, four of Leal’s rivals – Lincoln, Jeferson [sic], Teddy and Washington - have names with a presidential ring, underlining Brazil’s curious fondness for honouring US leaders with its kids. A fifth called Mandela was forced to withdraw. Leal earned his nickname when he moved to the Amazon before Trump’s 2016 election and acquaintances spotted a likeliness to the US’s corpulent leader: “Everyone started calling me Trump, Trump, Trump – and Trump stuck.” He dodged political labels but said he was unhappy with Brazil’s rightwing leader and criticised Bolsonaro’s handling of a pandemic that has killed nearly 160,000 Brazilians.
“I voted Bolsonaro … but, let’s be frank, he’s really buggered things up. He’s tripping himself up with his own legs,” Leal said. Nixon said he would also vote Biden if he could. “Trump makes me afraid – for our world, for our future … and he was the guy who ushered in Bolsonaro. “They share the same philosophy and this sick ideology,” added the Brazilian socialist, who hoped both would soon be out of office. “If Trump falls, Bolsonaro will go down with him, without a shadow of a doubt.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1350,Corbyn's constituents air frustration and anger over suspension,10/30/20,"Hussein Jabar still can’t believe Jeremy Corbyn was suspended from the Labour party. The owner of Gadz Cafe in Finsbury Park, which is decorated with pictures of the former Labour leader, shook his head and simply said: “Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t deserve this.” Labour was plunged into further turmoil on Thursday after it suspended Corbyn over his comments about a damning report into antisemitism within the party. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) found the party responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination. Corbyn said of the report: “One antisemite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons.” Labour announced his suspension at 1pm, with Corbyn finding out from a camera operator as he left a community centre in north London. In a later interview, the former Labour leader urged his followers to “stay in the party” to fight for leftwing principles.
In his constituency of Islington North, which Corbyn won with 64.3% of the vote in the 2019 election, there was anger on Friday over his suspension. While most people did not have pictures of him plastered across their walls, support for the former Labour leader ran deep. “This man works very, very hard for anyone. He spends his whole life helping people,” said Jabar, who has known Corbyn for several years. “Everyone here knows Jeremy is a very good man. This is hard to see, especially with his age. They should be giving him something for his retirement, not this.” One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “Corbyn is a very nice man and very popular here. I’ve known him for a long time and he is always helping poor people. He doesn’t have the arrogance of the other politicians.” He added: “When I woke up this morning and I saw the news, I was so upset. I feel like he is family. He worries about our problems, he is always helping us.” But there was also frustration at how Corbyn responded to the report’s findings. Sue Davies, who was helping her granddaughter move in with her partner, said: “Where he let himself down is that throughout the entire controversy of antisemitism he never stepped up … And when he did talk about antisemitism, he didn’t talk about antisemitism, he talked about racism. Jewish people wanted to hear him on antisemitism.”
Her granddaughter’s partner, Gill, disagreed. “I think he has been misconstrued. I am Jewish myself and I know he isn’t antisemitic. Unfortunately, I do think he has a lot of people behind him who maybe pushed him to say what he said yesterday, but Keir Starmer is an idiot.” She added: “He [Corbyn] was the person who wanted the report to come out. And the press is just twisting it as though he interfered and he didn’t interfere.” Davies said she remembered the first rally she went to after Corbyn became leader and how excited she felt. “He was pro-Palestinian and I understand that, but many Jewish people are pro-Palestinian, and that was never acknowledged. He should have been upfront and had press conference after press conference, day after day.” Ella, a recent university graduate, said she was desperate for Labour to be the strong oppositional party the country needed right now. “It’s disappointing to see such a fractured and divided party when we need a strong opposition.” She said she and her mother had backed Corbyn and she was disappointed to hear he had been suspended, but felt in some way it was inevitable. “It felt like the entire way through his leadership of the party, there were always people rallying against him and trying to divide the party in two.”",,Politics,Guardian,4
1351,"Corbyn-supporting MPs discussed quitting Labour, Ian Lavery says",10/30/20,"Labour MPs who support Jeremy Corbyn have discussed resigning from the parliamentary party and sitting as independents amid fears that Keir Starmer could lead a “mass purge” of the left, an ally of the former leader has said. As senior party figures called for calm following Labour’s suspension of Corbyn on Thursday for saying the party’s antisemitism problem had been overstated, Ian Lavery said there are fears that the move was a “war cry” that could force some MPs to leave. Lavery, who chaired the party for three years until April, told the Guardian that many of Corbyn’s supporters, including MPs, fear the suspension is the beginning of a significant change in direction under Starmer. On Friday evening senior figures close to Starmer and Corbyn were engaged in informal talks in an effort to allow the former leader to return to the party. Officials from Unite the Union have been involved in the discussions, which are expected to continue over the weekend, it is understood. Many on the left of the party, including general secretaries of affiliated trade unions and Socialist Campaign Group MPs, remain furious with the decision to suspend Corbyn. But they have been warned by those closest to the former leader not to do or say anything which may make his position more difficult. Lavery’s comments come after Starmer defended the party’s decision to withdraw the whip from his predecessor. The new Labour leader added that he has not ruled out expelling Corbyn from the party he led until six months ago. Meanwhile, a poll from Ipsos Mori showed Labour five points ahead of the Conservatives on 42%, the first time the opposition had been ahead according to the pollster since Boris Johnson became prime minister, although the research was conducted in the week leading up to Corbyn’s suspension. Lavery told the Guardian on Friday: “I have heard people suggest that if this is going to a continued change in political direction then perhaps they might not stay the full term as a Labour party representative. Perhaps they [MPs] might be convinced to become independent Labour. “I have heard MPs saying that if this is a purge of the left and things aren’t resolved and continue in the same direction, then they would have to check their conscience to see whether they could stay as Labour MPs until the end of this parliament. There is a possibility of people moving to becoming independent.” Any such move would be a “disaster,” Lavery said, urging all MPs to stay within the party, but he called on senior figures including Starmer to reach out before it is too late. “The only way we will win an election is by staying as a united party. If people perceive this to be an all-out attack on the left of the movement – and if that is borne out by other decisions by the leader – there will be issues that will come to the fore that will result in massive problems. “I would urge those MPs not to leave and I would urge the leader’s office to reach out. We have got to try to keep people calm. This dispute with Jeremy has got to be resolved as quickly as we possibly can and then we can move forward,” he said.
Lavery, the MP for Wansbeck in Northumberland, said Labour’s decision to suspend Corbyn could be challenged because it had broken a key recommendation of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report, which found the party responsible for three legal breaches over antisemitism. “The EHRC recommendations, all of which I support, said quite clearly that there shouldn’t be any intervention from the leader’s office in disciplinary matters. Jeremy was suspended on Keir’s say-so,” he said. This is denied by the party, who say the general secretary, David Evans, made the decision. The widening schism in the party could be healed if the two sides come to a resolution over Corbyn’s suspension, Lavery said. “I think that there has been a miscalculation and there is room for discussion between the adults in the room to see if there can be some sort of resolution,” he added. In a series of interviews on Friday, Starmer insisted he had had nothing to do with this disciplinary process. Party staff were told this afternoon that the only person consulted by Evans in advance of his decision to suspend was a lawyer. Asked if possible disciplinary action against Corbyn could include expulsion, Starmer said: “Yes, people have been expelled from the Labour party.” He told the BBC: “But it’s not for me to say what process should be followed, that’s for the general secretary, or what sanction is in order. “I don’t want a civil war in the Labour party. I don’t think there’s any need for one. I want to unite the party. But I’m not going to renege on my commitment to root out antisemitism.” Starmer said he had spelled out to Corbyn on Wednesday evening how he intended to respond to the damning report by the EHRC. “I’m deeply disappointed in that response from Jeremy Corbyn yesterday not least because I spoke to him the night before the report to set out how I intended to deal with it,” he said. Others on the party’s left were preparing to speak up in support of the suspended former leader on Friday night.
Members’ pressure group Momentum held an online rally, with familiar allies John McDonnell, Diane Abbott,and Richard Burgon among those who spoke. . McDonnell told the event that what happened to Corbyn was “profoundly wrong and must be reversed”. He added: “We are stumbling into one hell of a row, over what? The use of language, misrepresentation and overreaction. My advice is with a bit of explanation with what was meant in statements we can save ourselves a lot of grief.” Closing the event, Abbott said she was “shocked and saddened” by the suspension. “It’s most damaging to the prospect of a Labour government,” the former shadow home secretary said. “There’s a truism in British politics that divided parties do not win elections.” Despite Lavery’s comments, some allies and colleagues of both Starmer and Corbyn seemed keen to step back from any immediate confrontation, with Labour officials saying that while the disciplinary process was out of Starmer’s control, there would be “lots of meetings” taking place with all sides in the interim. Len McCluskey, leader of the Unite union, Labour’s biggest financial donor, also rolled back from his more combative tone from Thursday, saying it was “a sensitive time” and people should remain measured. “Now is the time for some calmness, so we can see if we can resolve this,” he told Sky News. “Yesterday should have been about moving on from antisemitism, and embracing what the EHRC said, which Keir did, and unfortunately we’ve all been knocked off the rails a little bit by Jeremy’s suspension.” McCluskey is understood to have toned down his comments after a conversation with Starmer. McCluskey met the Labour leader on Friday afternoon with proposals for an negotiated end to the suspension, but there was no immediate sign that anything had emerged as a result. One Corbyn ally said they believed the Labour leadership would be keen to resolve the disagreement quickly and that both sides were seeking “mutual ladders to climb down”. However, they disputed Starmer’s implication that Corbyn had been fully briefed about the repercussions of downplaying the scale of antisemitism in Labour before the EHRC report, saying the pair only had a “short” phone call on Wednesday evening, with few details.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1352,Covid: Dominic Raab refuses to deny possibility of tier 4 restrictions,10/30/20,"The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has refused to deny that ministers are considering introducing a higher tier 4 level of coronavirus restrictions, less than three weeks after the launch of the three-tier lockdown model. Officials are reportedly drawing up plans for an extra layer of measures forcing restaurants and non-essential shops to close in parts of England with the highest infection rates. Asked whether a new tier 4 was being considered, Raab told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday: “We’re always ready for further measures that we can take. But I think the most important thing about further measures is that we continue on the track we’re on of targeting the virus.”
Ministers are under increasing pressure to announce a nationwide circuit breaker as hospital admissions in badly hit parts of the country exceed the height of the first wave. Raab, who in effect is Boris Johnson’s number two, insisted the “overwhelming scientific advice” to the government was that local lockdowns were “the right way to go”. He said the government was “striving to avoid” a second national lockdown despite France, Germany and Wales announcing similar countrywide measures in recent days. He told Sky News that the idea of “a short, sharp circuit breaker is frankly something of an enigma” and that those calling for one had not set out the exit route from a national intervention.
The government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) advised five weeks ago that the government should urgently consider a nationwide two-week circuit breaker lockdown – similar to that in spring while keeping most schools open – but this was ignored at the time. Raab said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that “the overwhelming scientific advice to us is targeted measures are the right way to go if you take them and you’re committed to them”. He added: “The arbitrariness of a blanket approach would be far worse than the effects of trying to be as targeted as possible” and that a localised approach was “fair” and “fits the natural justice that we’re focusing on the areas where the uptick is the greatest”.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1353,"Donald Trump Jr and father play down Covid deaths as daily toll nears 1,000",10/30/20,"As coronavirus deaths in the US approach 1,000 a day in the current record surge of infections, Donald Trump and his son, Don Jr, appear intent on publicly disputing the lethality of the outbreak at repeated opportunities. Don Jr sat for an interview with Fox News on Thursday night during which he called critics of the Trump administrationâ€™s approach to the pandemic â€œtruly moronsâ€� and said that deaths from Covid-19 in America right now are â€œalmost nothingâ€�.
Meanwhile, having said at a rally last weekend that â€œyou donâ€™t see deathâ€� at this stage of the pandemic in the US, Donald Trump reiterated in a tweet on Friday morning that deaths are â€œWAY DOWNâ€� in the US, mass testing is exaggerating the numbers of infections and hospitals are coping.
In fact, many hospitals across the US, especially the midwest and upper midwest heartland and Texas are on the brink of being overwhelmed and are setting up field hospitals and calling in the military and assistance from state governors. On Fox News, Don Jr said: â€œIf you look at, I put it on my Instagram, I went through the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] data because I kept hearing about the new infections, [but] why arenâ€™t they talking about deaths? Oh, oh, because the number is almost nothing, because we have gotten control of this thing.â€� Public health experts, such as the top public health official on the White Houseâ€™s own coronavirus taskforce, Anthony Fauci, just this week warned that the US was in for â€œa whole lot of painâ€� this winter because it is not controlling the pandemic, and that life probably will not return return to normal until late 2021 or 2022, even with a successful vaccine likely to emerge in the coming months. Nearly 90,000 new coronavirus infections were reported in the US on Thursday, the highest single-day total in the country since the pandemic began, or about one new case every second. In the recent surge deaths can lag cases by several weeks. But already deaths are increasing in about half of states, the New York Times reported. And in the past month, about a third of US counties hit a daily record of deaths in the pandemic.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1354,Dossier alleges Cummings may have perverted course of justice in account of lockdown trip,10/30/20,"Police and the Crown Prosecution Service have been handed a 225-page dossier urging them to investigate Dominic Cummings for allegedly perverting the course of justice, in relation to a statement about his journeys to the north-east of England at the height of the pandemic. The former regional chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal said Cummings’ claims during a press conference in Downing Street’s rose garden on 25 May affected the course of justice as they were made as Durham police’s investigation into his behaviour was already under way. Afzal’s lawyers gave extensive details of the allegation in the dossier sent on Friday to Durham police, the Metropolitan police and Max Hill, the director of public prosecutions, and his staff at the CPS. They claimed the legal test for such a prosecution had been met. The dossier also accuses Cummings and his wife, Mary Wakefield, of multiple alleged offences under the coronavirus regulations for leaving their primary home in London and their second home in Durham without, it says, a reasonable excuse. The most serious allegation in the documents is the claim that Cummings perverted the course of justice in his account of his journey to Barnard Castle on 12 April and his denial of a claim that he made a second lockdown trip to Durham. If such a charge were proven, Cummings could face a prison sentence. In a statement, Afzal’s lawyers said: “The alleged offence of perverting the course of justice arises from Mr Cummings’ statement in the rose garden … Mr Cummings made public assertions about his conduct at Barnard Castle on 12 April and his actions on the weekend of 17-19 April that appear to be wholly inconsistent with accounts of his conduct at that time obtained from eyewitnesses.”
Cummings admitted in his statement that he had travelled to Durham and Barnard Castle, as revealed by the Guardian and the Daily Mirror. He said he had acted legally and travelled to Durham to self-isolate after his wife became sick with suspected Covid, and a day before he also fell ill. He claimed he had phone data to prove he was not in Durham on 19 April as one Guardian source had claimed. When three other people made similar claims, Downing Street said it considered the matter closed and refused to release the evidence that Cummings said proved he was in London. Two of the people, Dave and Clare Edwards, gave statements to Durham police officers on 25 May as the prime minister’s chief aide was giving his press conference, claiming that they saw a man whom they believed to be Cummings on 19 April in Durham’s Houghall woods. The submissions from Afzal’s lawyers said Cummings’ account appeared to have influenced a three-day investigation by Durham police into his lockdown journeys. The force made no finding on his decision to leave London because its investigation was confined to County Durham. It concluded that the journey to Barnard Castle on Wakefield’s birthday amounted to a “minor” breach of the rules “because there was no apparent breach of social distancing”, and it found there was “insufficient evidence” that he made a second trip. Afzal’s lawyers said new statements from witnesses called these conclusions into question. At least three people have reported seeing Cummings in Barnard Castle, including Robin Lees, a retired chemistry teacher, who alerted the Guardian and the police to seeing Cummings and his family getting into a car on a road on the southern side of the Tees on 12 April. Cummings said he stayed by the Tees for 10 to 15 minutes and strayed no more than 15 metres from his car. But Rosalind Evans, a retired council worker, told the Guardian and the police that she saw someone she believed to be Cummings in the town centre on 12 April. A third person, Alan Gowland, told the Sunday Times and later the Guardian that he saw someone he believed to be Cummings on a path by a weir on the other side of the Tees from Lees’ sighting. Afzal’s dossier includes eight annexes of new statements from witnesses in Barnard Castle and Durham. The Met and the CPS have previously refused Afzal’s request to investigate the allegations against Cummings. Afzal, whose brother Umar died from coronavirus when he was self-isolating at home on 8 April when Cummings was in Durham, said he wanted to get to the truth. “The picture painted by the witnesses that have come forward appears clear and coherent and is inconsistent in important parts with the version given by Mr Cummings,” he said. “I believe the CPS’s public interest test is also met, given the impact that this has had on general compliance with Covid regulations.” A No 10 spokesperson said: “The prime minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and he considers the matter closed. Durham Constabulary have made clear they are not taking any further action against Mr Cummings and that by locating himself at his father’s premises he did not breach the regulations.” Cummings and Wakefield have been approached for comment.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1355,Friday briefing: Labour's day of shame and blame,10/30/20,"Top story: McCluskey warns of Labour split Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this morning. Labour has been plunged into turmoil after former leader Jeremy Corbyn was suspended in the wake of a damning report into antisemitism that found the party responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination. Len McCluskey, leader of Labour’s single biggest donor, the Unite union, said the decision risked splitting the party. The investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission found that the party had interfered in antisemitism complaints, had failed to provide adequate training to those handling complaints and was guilty of harassment. But what Keir Starmer called a “day of shame” for the party quickly developed into an internal crisis when his predecessor released a statement rejecting the findings and blaming the media for exaggerating the issue. Amid dismay at party HQ, Labour promptly suspended Corbyn, setting off accusations and counter-accusations between the party’s left and rightwing factions. Many of today’s papers report on a coming “civil war”. Margaret Hodge argues that antisemitism must never be allowed to return, while it appears the report has done nothing to draw a line under the issue. * * * Macron pledge – Emmanuel Macron, the French president, says the country will “give in to nothing” as he called for calm and unity in the wake of the stabbing to death of three people in a church in Nice yesterday morning. The national anti-terrorist prosecutor was placed in charge of the investigation into why a man entered the Notre-Dame basilica in the centre of the city and killed a 60-year-old woman and a 55-year-old man. A woman aged 44 was also attacked but escaped to raise the alarm before dying from her wounds. A suspect was shot and “neutralised” by police but was not killed. He was named as Brahim Aouissaoui, a 21-year-old Tunisian who left his homeland in September for Italy and entered France only at the beginning of the month. Leaders around the world condemned the attack, which has prompted Macron to deploy troops to guard churches and schools. The stabbings follow the murder two weeks ago of a Paris teacher targeted for showing students cartoons of the prophet Muhammad, and place the issue of Islamist extremism back in the national spotlight.
* * * Refugee plea – The United Nations’ refugee agency has urged Britain to restart its resettlement scheme after four members of an Iranian Kurdish family died while trying to cross the Channel. As their extended family grieved in their home city of Sardasht in north-west Iran, the UNHCR’s UK representative, Rossella Pagliuchi-Lor, urged ministers to drop their hardline approach to migrants and facilitate the transfer of recognised refugees from an asylum country to the UK. * * * Coronavirus latest – West Yorkshire will on Monday become the latest urban area to enter the strictest tier of restrictions as the government faces mounting pressure to consider a second national lockdown. Nottinghamshire entered the tier 3 lockdown at mignight and it means nearly 11 million people in England will be living under the most severe curbs by next week, with a further 21.6 million under tier 2 restrictions. Infections are spreading rapidly across the country, with southern England now seeing a sharp spike. The home secretary, Priti Patel, yesterday did not rule out a second lockdown, as has already been announced in Germany and France, where schoolchildren above the age of six will have to wear face masks to keep schools open. Keep track of global developments here. One in four nurseries and childminders in deprived areas of England will not stay in business after Christmas without additional income, according to a survey, as the pandemic continues to squeeze demand for the sector. Guardian readers who work outside give some tips on how to keep warm when you’re socialising around the firepit this winter. It’s all about the layers, apparently. * * * Arming America – A record of almost 17m guns have been sold in the United States so far this year, according to estimates from a firearms analytics company, driven by fears about the coronavirus pandemic and the summer’s racial justice protests. A decision by Walmart to remove guns from display in its stores underlined concerns about possible unrest in the aftermath of Tuesday’s presidential election, with Donald Trump repeatedly casting doubt on the reliability of the country’s electoral system. Trump and his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, both held campaign rallies in the key battleground state of Florida overnight, but while the latter is ahead in the national polls, can they relied upon this time? * * * BBC ban – BBC journalists may no longer be allowed to attend gay pride marches, even in a personal capacity, after the director general unveiled new rules designed to head off complaints from rightwing media outlets about alleged political bias at the corporation. The guidelines introduced by Tim Davie ban news reporters from taking part in “public demonstrations or gatherings about controversial issues”. Journalists have been led to understand that while pride marches were not specifically mentioned, they would be stopped from attending due to the new rules. * * * Yes to euthanasia – New Zealand has voted convincingly to legalise euthanasia but appears to have rejected allowing recreational cannabis use, preliminary results of a dual referendum held on election day two weeks ago revealed this morning. The electoral commission said 65.2% of eligible voters ticked “yes” to legalising euthanasia, with 33.8% ticking “no”. Only 46.1% voted to legalise cannabis, while 53.1% voted no. While the count has not been completed, it is believed the cannabis resolution will be rejected. Today in Focus podcast White supremacist extremism is the most lethal terrorism threat to the US. It’s a hateful ideology that the Guardian’s Lois Beckett says has infected many parts of American society.
Lunchtime read: the best Halloween horror shows
In case you hadn’t noticed, Halloween is upon us again so we’ve asked some of our film writers to pick out the best scary movies you’ve (probably) never seen, ranging from Brazil’s first horror film to a found-footage gem. Sport Eddie Jones has claimed the Barbarians fiasco has reduced rugby union to a “laughing stock”, urging his England side to restore the sport’s reputation when they seek to clinch the Six Nations title on Saturday. Mo Farah’s rumoured appearance on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! next month could affect his chances of defending his 10,000m Olympic title, the head of UK Athletics has warned. Eddie Nketiah, Joe Willock and Nicolas Pépé scored in three minutes to give Arsenal a 3-0 Europa League victory over Dundalk, while Lior Refaelov’s wonder goal was enough for Antwerp to edge Tottenham 1-0, and first-half goals from Jamie Vardy and Hamza Choudhury gave Leicester a 2-1 win at AEK Athens. Bureta Faraimo and Ratu Naulago scored two tries apiece to give Hull a 31-16 Super League derby victory over local rivals Hull KR. The German rider Pascal Ackermann won stage nine of the Vuelta a España despite finishing second behind the Irishman Sam Bennett, who was relegated for barging an opponent. Dan Palmer, the former Australia international, has become just the second rugby union pro, after Welshman Gareth Thomas, to come out as gay. And former England player Ebony Rainford-Brent, who spoke up this summer about racism in cricket, says “the game has been shaken up and there is no going back”. Business Jobs are being lost at the fastest rate on record as Britain heads towards the brink of a double-dip recession just as Rishi Sunak is planning to close the government’s furlough scheme this weekend. Analysis by the Guardian shows that early warning indicators suggest business activity is faltering as local coronavirus lockdowns take effect and as unemployment is on course to hit the highest levels since the 1980s by Christmas. Although resilient retail spending has provided a bright spot for the economy, the Conservative peer David Young, who served under Margaret Thatcher, writes in the Guardian urging the chancellor to develop new measures to create jobs. The FTSE100 is on track to lift 0.25% this morning while the pound is buying $1.293 and €1.107. The papers
Labour strife dominates the front pages today, with the Guardian saying “Labour plunged into crisis after Corbyn suspended”. The Times reckons it’s “The battle for Labour’s soul” while the Telegraph says “Shaming of Corbyn sparks Labour civil war”. The Mail says ““R.I.P. Corbyn’s legacy of hate” and the Mirror headline searches for some positive spin with “Starmer’s zero tolerance”. The i reads “Labour facing civil war after Corbyn is suspended” while the Metro puns “Corbinned”. The Scottish Herald says “Labour split over Corbyn anti-Semitism bombshell”. The FT finds room for Labour’s woes but leads with “Trump seizes on record growth in late push to close gap on Biden”. The Express prefers another line altogether, reporting “Stampede to cash in on house sales”. In Scotland the Record reads “Local heroes” over a lead about Nicola Sturgeon’s plea for people to stay at home to avoid spreading the virus. Sign up

1356,From ice swims to knitting: Europeans seek ways to ride out Covid winter,10/30/20,"For Alice Weiss there is no alternative to what the Germans call Flucht nach vorne, or knuckling down, to cope with the challenge of surviving winter during a pandemic. Others are determined to stay warm as the temperature drops, but Weiss has embraced winter swimming, plunging into the chilly lakes on the western edge of Berlin. “It is invigorating, it takes me out of myself. It makes me stronger, healthier,” she said. “I’ve yet to have the legendary endorphin release that some swimmers talk of, but I expect that to come in winter.” Winter or “ice” swimming, as it’s known once the water gets cold enough, is just one of the ways Europeans across the continent have been trying to keep up morale while boosting their immune systems. Experts say psychological strain can have a huge impact on physical health, and the pandemic has inspired a boom in everything from knitting to foraging to a surprising craze for ponchos. Sometimes referred to as the “Estonian vitamin”, ice swimming or jääujumine is a flourishing trend among young people in the capital of Tallinn, where winter swimmers are organising a festival in a former Soviet submarine shipyard in December. They hope to set a world record for the number of participants in an ice swim.
For those without an icy lake nearby, cold water immersion of the kind advocated by the Dutch extreme athlete Wim Hof is possible just by taking a cold shower. It is an “alternative way of experiencing its benefits in the comfort of your own home,” says Hof. He has been running workshops during the pandemic to introduce more people to his theories about how to boost the immune system to keep the worst effects of the coronavirus at bay. “Wim Hof is good at three things in particular,“ according to Andreas Michalsen, the head of natural medicine at the Charité hospital in Berlin. He told the broadcaster DLF: “Cold therapy, breathing exercises and meditation, all of these can help prevent many stress-induced illnesses, from high blood pressure to autoimmune disorders.” For those looking for less adventure and more cosiness, knitting has found a new lease of life, particularly in Norway. “While not spawned by the pandemic, its fan base has only strengthened in numbers because of it,“ said one member of Strikkesida for Alle, or Knitting for Everyone, a Facebook group based in Norway that has introduced knitting to newcomers as well as encouraged veterans to pick up their needles.
In neighbouring Sweden, where there is also an unquenchable thirst for holiday cottages, interior design is receiving a boost, as is ice fishing, a previously somewhat old-fashioned activity now promoted as an antidote to the Covid-19 blues. Sales of pets and books have both been on the rise across Europe too, ditto Vitamin D and ginger. Ponchos are an even more unusual new craze. They might not be seen as very practical in normal times, says Anita Schmid, a translator who lives in the Belgian countryside, but they are “the next best thing to a blanket and useful for those of us not going out much but needing the nearest thing to a cuddle as we pursue hours on end of home office, possibly in a draught.”
In Barcelona, where the winters are generally sunnier and milder than up north, musicians have been meeting on the city’s roof terraces to practise, inevitably attracting audiences on adjoining terraces. Assuming the weather holds, some have pledged to continue to rehearse there through the winter. For people who have access to countryside, foraging for everything from sloe berries to funghi has been rediscovered from Scandinavia to Germany. For those who do not, there is always bread making – which has put a strain on yeast and flour supplies - letter writing, sock darning and jam making … as well as pottering, ceramics and night hiking.
In Germany, where most traditional Christmas markets have been cancelled, fans of glühwein, the hot mulled wine widely sold at the markets, have coined their own term for taking a flask of it on a walk in the forest: Adwaspaglüh. Alice Weiss, keen to warm her bones after her lakeside plunges, prefers her new infrared cabin, installed next to her bathroom for around €2,000. “Infrared light improves my circulation and helps me to sleep better,“ she said. “Like the winter swimming, it’s my way of taking back control at this difficult time.” • This article was amended on 2 November 2020 to correct an error in the spelling of jääujumine, which was introduced during the editing process.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1357,Global Covid report: Belgium facing new lockdown as Germany takes in patients,10/30/20,"Belgium was in effect put into a second national lockdown on Friday as scientists and officials directing efforts to control coronavirus said the government’s already tough restrictions were failing to work and that deaths were doubling every six days. Belgium’s prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said the government had no choice but to move into a “stricter lockdown”. “Our country is in a health emergency,” he said. “The pressure on hospitals is immense, our care providers are making inhuman efforts. In the past week, 100,000 of our fellow countrymen were infected, we do not see any change ... We are moving to a stricter lockdown.” After six hours of debate the federal government and the states decided to close all non-essential businesses for six weeks from Monday, including hairdressers. Supermarkets will only be allowed to sell essential items. Only one visitor will be allowed in each household and gatherings in public places will be restricted to four people. Those who live alone may have two visitors. It is already mandatory to work from home where possible and that will continue. The current midnight to 5am federal curfew will continue and bars and restaurants will remain shut. Schools will, however, reopen on 16 November after an extended half-term break and people will not have to give a reason to leave their homes, as in France. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said this week that Belgium had the highest number of coronavirus infections per 100,000 people in Europe.
Belgium has reported 1,391 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants over the past two weeks. Rates have alsosoared elsewhere across the continent, prompting a series of governments to tighten their restrictions on social contact. The Greek government said that from Friday it would impose regional lockdowns on its second-largest city of Thessaloniki and two other regions after a rise in cases. A new record in daily cases was reported in Spain, with a further 23,580 infections, bringing the nation’s tally to 1,136,503, health ministry data showed. The Spanish government voted on Thursday in favour of a six-month extension of the state of emergency, which allows Spain’s 17 regional governments to limit mobility, impose curfews and shut their borders with other regions. Italy registered a record 26,831 Covid infections in the previous 24 hours, its highest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. Under new restrictions, bars and restaurants must stop serving customers at 6pm while cinemas, theatres, swimming pools and gyms must close completely. With intensive care units under strain in many countries, including in Belgium, Germany’s health minister, Jens Spahn, said his country would open its hospitals to neighbouring countries for as long as it could. Belgium transferred its first patients to Germany on Thursday. Speaking after a video conference with his European counterparts, Spahn said: “It makes us humble and grateful to be lucky enough to be able to support our neighbours. So far we have taken from the Netherlands. Of course we will help Belgium, the Czech Republic and all our neighbours as soon as they ask and as long as we can.”
There has been growing acceptance in all parts of Belgium that a new series of restrictions would be imposed. Dr Yves Van Laethem, Belgium’s federal spokesman for Covid-19, had warned last week a lockdown would be inevitable unless the current measures began to bear fruit this week. He told reporters on Friday that he was unable to report any positive developments. “The indicators have not changed and all remain red,” Van Laethem said. “For the last week, for the first time, we exceeded 100,000 new contaminations. Hospital admissions remain high with a doubling every eight days and we have a doubling of mortality every six days. In short, nothing is changing in a favourable way at the moment.” The government has been forced to stop testing those who are asymptomatic due to a lack of laboratory capacity, leading to a week-on-week increase in recorded infections of just 38%. “[But] projections have also concluded that if the testing policy had not been modified, 18,000 contaminations per day would be recorded, an increase of 66%,” Van Laethem said. The pandemic hotspots are in Liège, Hainaut and the Brussels capital region. On Wednesday a record was broken with 743 hospital admissions, higher than any day at the height of the first wave. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, took France into a lockdown at midnight on Thursday until at least December, warning that the country’s health system was being “overwhelmed” by the disease. A dash by Parisians to either escape the new national lockdown or scramble back to the French capital to prepare for the restrictions caused record traffic jams on Thursday night. The movement in and out of the city created 706km (438 miles) of traffic on roads in the region by 6pm, according to France’s traffic department. Germany is also shuttering its hospitality and leisure sectors from Monday.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1358,Health chief in England's worst-hit Covid area calls for immediate lockdown,10/30/20,"The public health chief in England’s worst-hit coronavirus area has called for an immediate three-week “circuit breaker” across the country, calling Boris Johnson’s current approach “the worst of all possible outcomes”. Prof Dominic Harrison, the director of public health at Blackburn with Darwen borough council, said it was “highly unlikely” that the strictest tier 3 restrictions would reduce the infection rate or protect the NHS. “To put it bluntly, we’re going to need a much harsher set of control measures that look very much more like the first total lockdown, and very much more like what France is doing,” he told the Guardian. “It doesn’t have to be exactly the same as the first lockdown but unless we do an awful lot more, it’s really not going to have the desired effect.” Downing Street is facing mounting pressure to implement tougher or countrywide measures amid concerns the localised approach is failing. Almost 60% of England’s population will be under such restrictions by Monday, including nearly 11 million people north of Nottinghamshire living under the most severe lockdown restrictions. Harrison’s area, Blackburn, has the highest infection rate in England – at 740 cases per 100,000 people it is nearly quadruple the country’s average, according to the latest NHS Digital data – despite having been under local restrictions for 13 weeks.
The government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said five weeks ago that the government should urgently consider a nationwide two-week “circuit breaker” lockdown – similar to that in spring, while keeping most schools open – but this was ignored. Harrison said the north of England was now “likely to pay a disproportionate price for that scientific advice not being taken” and that there was no other option but to have a national lockdown for at least three weeks. “Because the government decided not to do that on the 21st of September it will have to last longer to have the same effect because we would enter it with higher [infection] rates,” he said, adding that the UK should take note of the national measures announced in recent days in France and Germany. “The idea of British exceptionalism, that we can fix it ourselves with some other kind of strategy, is going to be increasingly hard to defend,” he said. Harrison suggested primary schools should continue to operate as normal but that secondary schools should operate on a two-week rota basis, except for pupils with special educational needs and the children of key workers who would remain in school full-time. The disruption, he said, would be less than the current situation of whole year group bubbles being sent home. Harrison said the emerging consensus of many public health professionals and epidemiologists was that the strictest tier 3 measures – meaning the closure of pubs and bars that could not serve meals, as well as some other venues – were not “strong enough to turn around the high rates of transmission we’ve got in those tier 3 areas”. Harrison said he believed a national lockdown would be announced or happen by default in about a fortnight, when the infection rate in London catches up to parts of the north-west, where tier 3 was implemented this month. “By that time, of course, the north-west will have been in a tier-3 system that really was obviously not going to fix the problem,” he said. “And will have been further disadvantaged economically, socially. Everyone will be even more fed up and will be very conscious of the unfairness of it.” Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said on Friday that the idea of a “short, sharp circuit breaker” was “frankly an enigma”. He said the “overwhelming scientific advice” to the government was that local lockdowns were “the right way to go”.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1359,Iran moves detained academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert back to Tehran prison,10/30/20,"The detained British-Australian academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert has been moved back to Tehran’s Evin prison, sources with knowledge of her case have confirmed to the Guardian. Moore-Gilbert is understood to be back in the secretive ward 2A of Tehran’s largest prison, where she had spent much of the past two years under the control of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. A Cambridge-educated Middle East scholar, Moore-Gilbert was convicted in a secret trial and given a 10-year sentence for espionage after being arrested in September 2018 in Tehran, where she had attended a conference. She was suddenly removed from Qarchak women’s prison last Saturday, and for days her whereabouts were unknown to family and friends.
Other political prisoners have been moved back to 2A as a prelude to their release, sources have told the Guardian, but there is no firm evidence this is the case with Moore-Gilbert. Her move could be related to conditions at Qarchak prison or other concerns about her detention, sources said. Last week Moore-Gilbert met the head of Iran’s Prisons Organisation, Mohammad Mehdi Haj-Mohammadi, and the secretary of the Iranian High Council for Human Rights, Ali Bagheri-Kani, and reportedly raised issues about her incarceration. After the meeting, reported by Iranian judiciary’s official news agency Mizan, Haj Mohammadi told prison staff they should act to fix shortcomings at Qarchak. “We understand that a prisoner is a criminal before entering the prison, but after entering the prison, we consider them a needy, capable person deserving of correction and assistance.” Isolated in the desert outside Tehran, Qarchak is widely regarded as the worst women’s prison in Iran, and known as a site of extrajudicial killings, torture and other rights violations. But Moore-Gilbert was in good condition in the days before she was moved from her ward in Qarchak, according to activists, including one who shared a cell with her last week. Nasrin Sotoudeh, an Iranian human rights lawyer and political prisoner, was a close friend of Moore-Gilbert’s when they shared a cell in Evin. Last week Sotoudeh was moved to Qarchak where she was reunited with Moore-Gilbert, Sotoudeh’s husband, Reza Khandan, told the Guardian on Thursday. They shared a cell together for about five days, he said. Sotoudeh could say little on their monitored calls, but told him: “She was in a good and comfortable condition in that ward compared with other wards of Qarchak prison and Evin which she had previously been. But unfortunately she spent only a few days in that ward … and then moved. “They were talking in English,” Khandan said. “[Kylie] was in a good condition in those final days and had someone around to talk to.” The eyewitness account confirms reports by the Human Rights Activists News Agency that Moore-Gilbert was moved on Saturday with all her possessions. Iranian activists including Khandan have spoken to contacts inside the public wards of Evin prison, who say Moore-Gilbert has not appeared there. He said if Moore-Gilbert was in ward 2A, controlled by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, she would have no contact with the outside world.
“Inmates there are either in a single-person cell or two in one cell, and have no phone,” Khandan said. “Prisoners in this ward have no such freedom which they have in other wards. It has very tough restrictions.” No evidence of Moore-Gilbert’s alleged crimes has ever been publicly presented. She has denied the allegations against her, and the Australian government rejects them as baseless and politically motivated. Late on Friday, a Dfat spokesman told the Guardian that Australia’s ambassador in Tehran, Lyndall Sachs, had been advised that Moore-Gilbert has been moved to Evin prison. “Our ambassador last visited Dr Moore-Gilbert at Qarchak prison on 19 October. The ambassador has requested that the regular access to Dr Moore-Gilbert continue at Evin prison.” Free Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a group of friends, colleagues and supporters of the jailed academic said: “After a stressful six days, we’re relieved that the Australian government has finally managed to locate our friend Kylie Moore-Gilbert in Evin prison. But make no mistake: this is not a victory, nor does it suggest that progress is being made in Kylie’s case.” The group said the Australian government should concede it had failed Moore-Gilbert. “Not only did they lose an Australian citizen in the Iranian prison system for the second time in three months, but 778 days after her arrest, Kylie is back at square one in the prison where she was originally held. Australia has achieved no progress in Kylie’s case in more than two years, despite maintaining that their strategy is working. If quiet diplomacy was working, Kylie would not be treated worse than any other foreign national held in Iran. “The Iranian regime is running circles around the Australian government and this case is a shambles.” Sotoudeh, an internationally renowned lawyer, was sentenced last year to 38 years in prison and 148 lashes. Khandan said she was suffering from a heart condition and he was hoping she would be granted conditional leave to seek treatment at a hospital.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1360,Japan's 'love hotels' accused of anti-gay discrimination,10/30/20,"In May this year, at the height of the coronavirus’s first wave, two gay men living together in Amagasaki, western Japan, thought they would ease the boredom of the country’s soft lockdown with a visit to a love hotel, where couples pay for short stays to have sex. But rather than the carefree time they had anticipated, the couple, in their mid-30s, did not even get as far as the door to their room. “The receptionist was very polite,” one of the men told the Kobe Shimbun. “He just said men aren’t allowed.” An attempt to find a room at another love hotel nearby also ended in disappointment. But this time the language was overtly homophobic. “Gay men don’t use the facilities properly,” the female receptionist reportedly told them, without explanation. “It was a clear case of discrimination,” the man, who has not been named, told the newspaper. “We were being treated like second-class citizens.” He and his partner, who are in a civil partnership recognised by the local government, are not alone. While Japan’s thousands of love hotels welcome millions of heterosexual couples in search of the privacy and intimacy denied them at home, gay couples say they are routinely turned away. Despite rising awareness of LGBT rights, Japan is the only G7 country that does not recognise same-sex marriages, and much of the country’s multibillion-dollar love hotel industry accepts only heterosexual couples. Taiga Ishikawa, Japan’s first openly gay MP, estimated that of 143 love hotels in Tokyo’s Toshima ward, where he began his career as an assembly member, 30 refused entry to same-sex couples. The expectation that they will be rejected means many gay men have come to regard love hotels as off-limits, according to one member of Tokyo’s LGBT community, who told the Guardian: “Nothing dampens the prospect of a romantic evening out more than a homophobic hotel policy.” Akira Nishiyama, assistant executive director of the Japan Alliance for LGBT Legislation, said hotel rejections of same-sex couples were common, even though it is illegal under a 2018 revision to the hotel business law, which states that hotels “should not reject guests on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity”. On the rare occasions that customers report a hotel for homophobia, authorities simply offer the proprietors “administrative guidance” – a measure campaigners say lacks legal clout. Modern love hotels, so named after the first of their kind – Hotel Love – opened in Osaka in the late 1960s, originally catered to couples desperate to escape their extended families, who traditionally lived under one roof, for a few hours of intimacy. But a decline in the young population, the rise in single households, and the pre-pandemic boost in international tourism have prompted many to undergo image makeovers to appeal to travellers, including single guests looking for comparatively cheap and comfortable accommodation. As a result, the number of hotels with an overtly sexual theme has dwindled to less than 10,000 in recent years, compared with around 30,000 two decades ago. Still, every day an estimated 1.4 million Japanese people visit a love hotel, and analysts believe the industry generates between ¥2-3tn (£14.8bn-£22.2bn) a year. Gon Matsunaka, founder and president of Pride House Tokyo, which opened this month, believes most hotels will continue to ignore the law. “They often get away with discrimination as they don’t give an explicit reason for denying rooms to same-sex couples,” he said. “They make excuses, like claiming there are no rooms available. “We could have people coming from all over the world to next year’s Olympics, and if gay couples are denied entry to love hotels it will not reflect well on Japan.” Although some websites have started listing “gay-friendly” love hotels, Matsunaka said Japan’s refusal to fully accept the LGBT community, exemplified by the ban on same-sex marriages, made homophobia socially acceptable. “There are a few love hotels that accept same-sex couples, like in the ni-chome gay district of Tokyo, but it’s very limited,” he said. “There is no pressure on the industry to change its ways.” Japan has not passed an LGBT equality act, and a survey published this week found that 79% of LGBT respondents said they had heard discriminatory remarks about sexual minorities at work or school, although a large proportion – 67% – said social attitudes towards diversity of sexual orientation and gender identity had improved over the past five years. Only this month, Masateru Shiraishi, a conservative assemblyman in Adachi ward in Tokyo, was forced to apologise after saying the neighbourhood would be “wiped out” by depopulation if the rights of sexual minorities were protected by law. The lack of legal protection for sexual minorities makes it “really difficult” for many LGBT people to come out, said Nishiyama. “Places like love hotels where LGBTQ+ people can be guaranteed privacy are really important. They make it possible for them to be who they are, and to be with their partner, without fear.” The two hotels in Amagasaki were reprimanded after the man lodged a complaint, prompting officials to order them to stop discriminating against same-sex guests. Last month the city’s assembly said it planned to drop “opposite sex” from a local ordinance definition of love hotel clientele. “This is a great decision,” said Nishiyama. “A change in attitude among government organisations so they no longer exclude same-sex couples from love hotels will enable people to use them in safety. And it will raise awareness among hotel staff.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1361,Jeremy Corbyn's suspension: what will Labour do next?,10/30/20,"Why was Jeremy Corbyn suspended ? David Evans, the party’s new general secretary, sent Jeremy Corbyn an email at about 1pm on Thursday notifying him of his suspension from the Labour party after the former leader said antisemitism in the party had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons” as he responded to the Equality and Human Rights Commission report into the issue. The email came two and a half hours after Corbyn’s statement and, given the time elapsed, the message would have been brief, citing only the rule broken. Accusations about antisemitism are covered by Labour’s catch-all rule 2.1.8, which says: “No member of the party shall engage in conduct which in the opinion of the NEC is prejudicial, or in any act which in the opinion of the NEC is grossly detrimental to the party.” What happens next? Labour’s governance and legal unit will review the file and invite Corbyn to discuss the case, in a process expected to take several weeks or possibly months. The process typically involves an interview where a friend or lawyer can be present, and where officials will seek to establish if the former leader stands by his remarks, qualifies them, or seeks to apologise or walk them back. The interviews can often have an important bearing on proceedings; party insiders say that when the former London mayor Ken Livingstone was questioned, he was combative. Others, however, show contrition. What is the role of the party’s national executive committee (NEC)? Under Labour’s current rules, the case with a report from the governance unit is sent to the disputes panel subcommittee of the party’s ruling NEC, which is now up for election and is comprised of elected delegates from all parts of the Labour party from the membership to trade unions, councillors and MPs. The party has confirmed that its leader, Keir Starmer, who sits on the NEC, will not be involved in handling Corbyn’s complaint. Other senior figures such as the deputy leader, Angela Rayner, are unlikely to be involved either, meaning the case would be determined by a subgroup of less well-known Labour figures. What are the sanctions? The NEC disputes panel can recommend anything from ending the suspension, issuing a warning, or expulsion. In the case of expulsion, Corbyn would be able to appeal, this time to another party body, the national constitutional committee, which appoints a panel of three and operates similarly to a court. But there is a strong possibility Labour’s rules will change too. In response to the EHRC’s finding that Labour broke equalities law, Starmer promised to establish “an independent complaints process” – designed to be without political interference – which would be in place “as soon as possible in the new year”. What about the Conservatives and other parties? All parties have disciplinary systems but after the EHRC’s report, they are likely to have to be revamped. The Conservatives have been accused of refusing to take complaints about Islamophobia in its ranks seriously after ditching plans to hold an inquiry into the issue. Boris Johnson himself was subject to a complaint, eventually dropped by the party without further action, after he compared fully veiled Muslim women to letterboxes and bank robbers. The EHRC said as much in the foreword to its report, arguing that politicians on all sides had a responsibility for “challenging racism in all its forms”. But it complained that “in recent times, there have been examples of behaviour that falls well below the standards we would expect, from politicians of various parties”.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1362,Labour to investigate complaints of antisemitic messages after EHRC report,10/30/20,"Labour officials are poised to investigate complaints about antisemitic messages on social media after campaign groups reported an apparent increase in the use of suspicious terms after the publication of a damning report on the issue. The expected crackdown prompted concerns from allies of Jeremy Corbyn, who was suspended from the party over his response to the report, that members or officials who support the former leader on social media could also face sanctions. The inquiry by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which found Labour broke equalities law in areas including harassment and discrimination, was particularly critical about antisemitism on social media. It said that under Corbyn’s leadership the party’s investigators did not look into complaints about such content being liked or shared, “which meant that potentially antisemitic conduct went unchallenged”. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said the party would now “proactively investigate” the social media accounts of Labour members and officials to prevent the spread of such themes. The party leader, Keir Starmer, has more generally promised a robust disciplinary response over the issue. In interviews on Friday, in which he did not rule out the possibility of Corbyn being expelled, Starmer said that of 827 cases connected to antisemitism that had been dealt with since he took over as leader in April, a third of the perpetrators had been removed from the party.
As part of Labour’s promised response to the EHRC’s recommendations, officials are expected to draw up guidelines on what would constitute messages that would merit disciplinary action. Corbyn was suspended for saying in his response to the EHRC report that while he accepted its recommendations, the problem of antisemitism in Labour had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by opponents and the media. One issue yet to be determined is whether simply agreeing with, or repeating, this statement would amount to an offence, or if it would need to be a stronger message, for example, arguing that the claims of antisemitism in Labour more generally were a political plot. One ally of Corbyn expressed concern that the process could end up being a wider purge of members or officials sympathetic to the former leader. “It is a fact that polls have shown people believed the scale of antisemitism in the party was much greater than it actually was, so people can legitimately say that,” they said. “But the problem is, once you start a process it takes on its own dynamic.” Sefa Ozalp, a researcher at Cardiff University’s HateLab who studies hate speech on social media, said that antisemitism on Twitter had more than tripled compared with the week before the EHRC report was published. “Compared to the mean of antagonistic tweets counts in the seven days leading to the publication of the EHRC report, there was a 260% increase in antagonistic tweets on 29 October,” Ozalp told the Guardian. “This significant increase demonstrates that [the] offline antisemitism row in [the] Labour party triggers online discussion around Jewish identity and antisemitic sentiments.” The Community Security Trust, a Jewish organisation that monitors and tracks antisemitism and has previously produced reports about its prevalence on social media, said there were signs that the publication of the EHRC report could have triggered an increase in such postings. The group said it had used software to search for terms linked to leftwing antisemitism, such as “Zionist”, “Mossad” and “Rothschild”, alongside Starmer’s name over the past 30 days.
On Thursday there was a “significant spike”, it said, adding that some of the messages could have been expressing sentiments opposing antisemitism as the software covered all mentions. A separate issue for Labour officials to work out is their precise legal culpability for online sentiments expressed by officials and others. The EHRC report cited two instances where antisemitic conduct amounted to harassment under equality laws, one of which was due to Facebook comments by a Labour councillor. In dealing with social media messages, disciplinary teams must be able to discern not just whether those behind them were Labour members, but if they also held an official role, potentially making the party legally responsible, one insider said.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1363,Lessons from Estonia: why it excels at digital learning during Covid,10/30/20,"As hundreds of thousands of children in the UK found themselves shut out of education during lockdown, without access to a laptop or internet, pupils in Estonia reaped the rewards of the Baltic country’s long-term investment in digital learning. Long before coronavirus began to wreak havoc on the world, Estonia made the development of digital skills, high-speed internet and a sophisticated IT infrastructure a national priority. In 2001, it was one of the first countries in the world to classify internet access as a human right. Estonian schools have been using digital study materials and electronic school management systems for years, so when the pandemic hit and schools were forced to close in Tallinn, Estonian children went home where their studies moved seamlessly online. In the UK, by contrast, online education during lockdown was patchy, with children’s learning determined mainly by digital access. Teachers have had to rapidly develop new digital skills, and the government’s laptop scheme to provide kit to disadvantaged children in England has been criticised as too little, too late. “It has not been a piece of cake,” said Taavi Kreitsmann, a headteacher in Estonia. “But in many ways we are definitely in a more fortunate situation than others.” Kreitsmann is the head of Tartu Erakool, a school for seven– to 13-year-olds in Tartu, a city in the east of the country. Way before Covid, all 340 students at Kreitsmann’s school had their own iPads, centrally managed by the school and used routinely to deliver and learn lessons, and children were used to occasional online study days, where they worked from home rather than in the school building while their teachers were involved in other tasks. Admittedly, Tartu Erakool is private and may be better equipped than other schools, but since Estonia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the country’s ambitious young leaders have thrown themselves into the challenge of creating a digital state, with education at the heart of their plans. In 1997, a project called Tiigrihüpe (the Tiger Leap) was launched to provide computers and internet access for schools, and vital digital training for teachers. “Estonia has been preparing for digital education for years,” said Laura Limperk-Kütaru, the head of Estonia’s international relations department. “For us this transformation to distance learning was not something new.” Before the pandemic, most Estonian schools were routinely using digital study materials, including a platform of digital books called Opiq and electronic school management systems such as eKool, which connect pupils, parents and teachers. “All these systems have been set up for years now,” said Limperk-Kütaru. When Covid closed school buildings, “it was just moving from classrooms to a virtual environment”. Not every child in Estonia had access to a laptop or tablet, but where they did not, schools, local authorities and voluntary organisations stepped in. A team of university-trained “educational technologists” who are based in schools worked with teachers to ensure the best use of digital resources. The results so far are positive. “Teachers at schools were able to reach out to almost all children,” said Limperk-Kütaru, who is confident there has not been significant learning loss. “Currently we have not seen much difference from other years.” In England, there are fears that 10 years of progress in narrowing the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers may have been wiped out by Covid. Estonia has not only done well during lockdown, it has established itself in recent years as the new education powerhouse of Europe, outperforming even Finland in the international Pisa tests. With a population of just 1.3 million, the educational challenges Estonia faces are very different from those in the UK, but its digital success may hold lessons for other countries. Andreas Schleicher is the head of education and skills at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, where he also oversees the international Pisa tests. Asked why Estonia’s move to remote learning has been so successful compared with the UK’s, he said: “The key difference is that teachers and school leaders in Estonia are used to working as designers of innovative learning environments, and have great flexibility on how to best configure the people, the spaces, the technology and times in their respective context. “It goes back to when Estonia became independent. Unlike other countries in the region, they didn’t try to restore the old system but had a young generation of entrepreneurs create an entirely new public system with entrepreneurship and digitalisation at its heart.” The pandemic has reinforced Estonia’s commitment to digital education, and with disruption to school-based education likely to continue, other countries will follow suit. “Many things will never be the same again,” said Kreitsmann, “and education is one of those things.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1364,Man arrested over deaths of Iranian Kurd family in Channel sinking,10/30/20,"An Iranian man has been held on suspicion of manslaughter following the deaths of four people, and the disappearance of a further three who are believed to have died, as they attempted to cross the Channel. Iranian Kurds Rasul Iran Nezhad and his wife, Shiva Mohammad Panahi, both 35, and two of their children, Anita, nine, and Armin, six, drowned on Tuesday as they tried to reach Britain by boat after departing from near Dunkirk. The family’s third child, 15-month-old Artin, and two other adults are being treated as missing presumed dead by authorities. The suspect was allegedly piloting the semi-rigid boat that capsized carrying 22 people from the Grande-Synthe migrant camp near Dunkirk, according to reports. The weather and sea conditions at the time were “extremely unfavourable”, according to coastguards, and the boat was carrying too many people. The Dunkirk prosecutor Sébastien Piève said the suspect was arrested after statements from those who were rescued when the boat capsized. “He told us he was just a migrant, but the information we have gathered against him, notably from 13 others who were interviewed, suggests that he is close to the smugglers and his claims do not stand up,” Piève told reporters. The man has been “mis en examen” – officially put under investigation, close to being charged under French law – for involuntary homicide, the endangering of others’ lives and helping “illegals” as part of an organised gang, as well as criminal association. He has been placed in provisional custody. If convicted, he faces 10 years in jail and deportation from France after serving his sentence. The investigation is being handled by an investigating judge. Piève said the aim of police inquiries was to dismantle the smuggling network. In the UK, the deaths have led to renewed calls for the government to abandon its hardline approach to asylum seekers and expand or create safe and legal routes for people fleeing torture and death to travel to the UK and claim asylum.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1365,Mexicans for Trump? Amlo supporters have unlikely pick in US election,10/30/20,"Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador identifies as leftist, dismissing his opponents as “conservatives”. Donald Trump launched his 2016 bid for the US presidency by describing Mexican migrants as “rapists” and threatened economic ruin by ripping up a trade deals between Mexico, the United States and Canada. But some of the Mexican president’s supporters are pulling for an unlikely candidate in the upcoming US election: Donald Trump. “We want President Trump to stay in office. Why? Because there’s good communication between him and President López Obrador,” said Carolina Mayor, a veterinarian. “They understand each other perfectly because they’re nationalists. They’re nationalist presidents.” Amlo, as Mexico’s president is known, has not commented on the election, saying he wants to stay out of US politics. But he has forged a surprisingly close relationship with Trump, going out of his way to praise the US president, and deploying the national guard to crack down on Central American migants. Trump, meanwhile, has dialed down the insults and repeatedly called Amlo a “great guy”. Some Amlo supporters, taking a cue from the leader, have also adopted positive attitudes toward Trump – who they claim Amlo was able to “tame”. “I don’t think Trump is racist. Perhaps he says these things for political reasons,” Mayor said of the US president. “But broadcasters speak very badly of Trump – and they do the same with López Obrador.” Despite the many obvious differences between the austere Mexican leader and his ostentatious US counterpart, there are also close parallels, said political analyst Bárbara González Like Trump, Amlo frequently badmouths the press, describes himself in self-aggrandizing terms, indulges conspiracies and wallows in self-pity. “A president has never been attacked like now,” he said in a statement on his commitment to press freedom. Like Trump, Amlo is an enthusiastic supporter of fossil fuels, dismissing clean energy as a “fallacy”. Trump recently intervened in Opec+ negotiations to allow Mexico not to make serious cuts to its oil production. “They are both leaders of break-with-the-past movements and they both thrive on negative polarization and foster a cult of personality,” said González.
Amlo’s only international trip since taking power was a visit to Washington in July where he celebrated the signing of the USMCA trade deal – and was immediately included in Trump’s campaign ads. He did not meet with senior Democrats while there – a move analysts say could come back to bite him should Joe Biden win on 3 November. A foreign ministry spokesman said the Mexican government did not have a preference and would work productively with whoever won. But Amlo has continued to signal that he is comfortable working with the Trump administration: he recently released water from the Rio Grande Basin to the US to ensure Mexico met its obligations under an international treaty – despite drought conditions in Chihuahua state. He also sent immigration officials to the southern border in a show of force as a new caravan of Central Americans attempted to head north. Amlo’s apparent acquiescence on migration matters – including allowing asylum seekers to be returned to dangerous Mexican border cities while they wait for their cases to be heard in US courts – has not hurt him domestically. Polls put his approval rating above 60%, while Mexican attitudes towards migrants have also worsened.
“We gave in on stopping migrants, but from then onward, we haven’t heard many opinions from Washington on topics that would usually cause tension between the two countries,” said Brenda Estefan, a former security attache at the Mexican embassy in Washington. Those tensions traditionally included security issues, human rights and promoting democracy. But despite record murder rates, rampant conflict between organized crime factions and constant attacks on the Mexican press, the US government has stayed mostly silent. “Trump won’t get into your affairs and you won’t get into his. That’s very comforting for Amlo,” said Jorge Guajardo, senior director at McLarty Associates in Washington and a former Mexican ambassador to China. “So I think Amlo is heavily invested in a Trump re-election.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1366,National Covid lockdown expected across England next week,10/30/20,"Boris Johnson has bowed to pressure from his scientific advisers for new national lockdown restrictions, which are expected to be announced early next week, the Guardian has been told. Sir Patrick Vallance and Prof Chris Whitty, who head the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), are understood to have warned the prime minister that the time has come for national action across England. Sage scientists presented Johnson with evidence at a meeting in Downing Street, where they explained that Covid-19 is spreading significantly faster than their worst-case scenarios. The scientists, who are supported by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and Michael Gove, are understood to have argued that local measures are no longer enough and that the virus could kill 85,000 people this winter. Sage’s proposals for a two-week “circuit breaker” over half-term were turned down by ministers. It is now thought something longer will be needed. However, the exact extent of the new lockdown restrictions have yet to be decided. That will be thrashed out this weekend as Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, try to work out what can be imposed across England without major damage to the economy.
The scientists have been warning for weeks that the pandemic is spreading nationally and that local action will not be enough. The React study from Imperial College London this week flagged that the R number – measuring how many people are infected by each person transmitting the virus – was at its highest in the south of the country, which meant it was likely to follow the pattern in the north, which currently has the highest numbers of cases and where tier 3 restrictions are widely imposed. The development came after scientists and public health advisers said imposing new national measures could “save Christmas from the coronavirus” and allow families to meet during the festive season. Documents from Sage released on Friday showed Covid was spreading significantly faster through England than even the government’s predicted worst-case scenario for cases and hospital admissions earlier this month. Official figures also showed that more than half a million people were estimated to have had coronavirus in the week ending 23 October, with more than one in 100 people infected in England, up from one in 130 the previous week. There were a further 24,405 positive tests in the UK and a further 274 deaths. The impact on the economy of national restrictions would be significant, however. Many shops make the bulk of their profits in the “golden quarter” between Halloween and the January sales. The British Retail Consortium has launched a campaign asking shoppers to “shop early, start wrapping, enjoy Christmas”. Cases are rising faster in London and the south-east than in the north of England, which is subject to stricter measures, but the whole country is at a critical point, an Imperial College London report warned this week. On Friday Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, did not deny ministers were considering introducing a higher tier 4 level of coronavirus restrictions for England, with officials reportedly drawing up plans to force restaurants and non-essential shops to close in areas with the highest infection rates. Nearly 60% of England’s population is now subject to tier 2 or tier 3 measures, barring households from mixing indoors. Without intervention it was “only a matter of time” before most, if not all, of the country would face such restrictions, Dr Mike Tildesley warned. Tildesley, an epidemiologist from the University of Warwick, helped produce a “reasonable worst-case scenario” for the modelling sub-group of Sage, which warned that 85,000 people could die from Covid this winter. He told the Guardian: “As epidemiologists we need to think about the impact on public health and that’s really key, but I think it’s important for us to acknowledge that the general public has had a pretty rotten year [but] I don’t think any of the science group would advocate that we should remove all restrictions at Christmas – it’s clear that that’s not possible. “But speaking on behalf of myself, what I would like to see is that we are in a position to do a minor relaxation, for example allowing slightly larger family groups to be together, maybe having the rule of 10 or 12 instead of six. To do that we have to do something like a circuit break or something on a more national scale to bring incidents down … sooner rather than later.”
Dr Julian Tang, a consultant virologist at Leicester Royal Infirmary, said: “If we started now I would say you’d need at least six weeks of lockdown with total compliance across the nation. The government would have to fund that because the economy would be catastrophically hit. “Unfortunately after Christmas and new year the cases are going to rise again, but if we want that break we might have enough drop in [the reproduction number] to give everyone a break … If you say ‘if you want to save Christmas from the coronavirus Grinch’, then I think people will do it.” Linda Bauld, a professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said tighter restrictions in the devolved nations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland seemed to be working and that England should follow suit with a national circuit breaker. “I think it should be done, I don’t really see any other options, but I don’t think it would allow us to have a normal Christmas,” she said. “However, I would hope if you did have a circuit breaker it would bring the whole country in line with tier 1 by Christmas. “I’m cautiously optimistic here in Scotland that we might be able to meet people indoors from two or three households, say. It’s not normal, but it would allow you to see immediate family.” Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said: “I do think if we were to approach a national circuit break in the right way at the right time it would allow families more contact over the Christmas period than might otherwise be the case – particularly if we ask families to manage their own isolation arrangements … so that perhaps two households could bubble together.” At a press conference on Friday he presented figures showing cases in London and the south-east had increased by 55% and 63% week on week, compared with 43% in Greater Manchester. The leader of Birmingham city council, Ian Ward, called for an urgent national lockdown to last four weeks, warning tier 3 curbs were not sufficient to protect the NHS. “The sooner we implement a national circuit breaker, the better because that will save lives and it will do more to save the economy,” he said. “If there are eight weeks to go until Christmas … we need a four-week [national] circuit breaker … [as] the best opportunity to get on top of the numbers to drive the case rates back down again and allow for some easing, or other restrictions, for families over that Christmas period.” Downing Street is concerned that Covid measures will not be adhered to over Christmas. This week the TV and radio presenter Victoria Derbyshire was forced to apologise after declaring she would break the “rule of six” for her festive lunch. Others have suggested ways around the rules, including holding a funeral on 25 December for a “pet turkey”, while one man from Leeds set up a company so he could hold an “unpaid work event” with people from outside his household on Christmas Day. On Thursday Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the best chance to secure some “Christmas cheer” was to stick to the different tiered restrictions for areas across Scotland. The shadow UK health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said he doubted a family of more than six would be able to meet up at Christmas. “I think because they’ve missed this window of opportunity over the half-term, I’m worried now that what we’ll see is deeper, more drastic lockdown action throughout November and December, which sadly probably does put Christmas at risk,” he told Times Radio.
His Labour colleague Khalid Mahmood, the MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, said it was now time for those thinking of Christmas celebrations to recognise the sacrifices made by Muslims across the UK earlier this year. Swathes of northern England went into lockdown on 31 July, hours before the festival of Eid-al-adha. “People had been preparing to see their families, all the food had been cooked, the clothes had been bought and then literally with a few hours’ notice Eid was cancelled in some parts of the country,” he said. “But we bit the bullet and stayed resolute and just got on with it because we were told we had a duty and we couldn’t let the side down. Now is the time for others to do the same.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1367,New Zealand votes to legalise euthanasia in referendum,10/30/20,"New Zealanders have voted to legalise euthanasia for those with a terminal illness, in a victory for campaigners who say people suffering extreme pain should be given a choice over how and when to bring their life to a close. The decision on whether to legalise euthanasia appeared as a referendum question on the 17 October general election ballot paper, alongside a second referendum question on whether to legalise cannabis – which did not succeed, according to preliminary results. The results of the euthanasia referendum are binding and will see the act come into effect 12 months from the final results – on 6 November 2021. Assisted dying will be administered by the Ministry of Health.
Preliminary results announced on Friday by the electoral commission saw 65.2% of eligible voters tick “yes” to legalising euthanasia, with 33.8% ticking “no”. Only 46.1 % of New Zealanders voted to legalise cannabis, while 53.1% voted no. The referendum results so far do not include nearly half a million special votes, meaning the final results will not be confirmed until 6 November. This has left cannabis supporters hoping special votes may be able to tip the outcome, but they would need to be overwhelmingly in favour – an outcome seen as slim. For years support for euthanasia has hovered around the 60-70% mark in polls, with widespread backing across the political spectrum, from prime minister Jacinda Ardern to opposition leader Judith Collins. The vote makes New Zealand the seventh country in the world to legalise assisted dying. It was a “momentous day” for the country, said campaigner Mary Panko. “It’s now clear what we have known for decades that Kiwis want, and have always wanted, the right to die on their own terms,” said Panko. “One day New Zealanders will shake their heads in amazement that the basic human right to say ‘no’ to intolerable suffering ever had to be debated in this country … now because of the passing of this Act our lives as well as our deaths will be immeasurably better.” Matt Vickers is the widow of Lecretia Seales, who died of a brain tumour in 2015 and was at the forefront of efforts to legalise euthanasia. “I feel relieved, and I feel grateful that New Zealanders were kind enough to pass this law, and to give the terminally ill a say about how they die,” said Vickers. The referendum follows the passing of the End of Life Choice Act in parliament in 2019. Under New Zealand law, the act could only come into force if more than 50% of voters ticked “yes” on the referendum ballot. The act outlines criteria for who can apply to end their life, including that they be aged 18 or over, are New Zealand citizens, are suffering from a terminal illness that will end their life within six months, “have a significant and ongoing decline in physical capability”, are “enduring unbearable suffering that cannot be eased” and are in a position to make an “informed decision” about their death. Those suffering mental illness or decline would not be eligible, nor would those applying solely on the basis of “advanced age” or a disability. Two doctors – one independent – would have to sign off on the decision, with a psychiatrist called in if either doctor has any doubts. ACT party MP David Seymour, who sponsored the bill, has been a tireless campaigner for euthanasia, saying New Zealand has steadily become “decades” behind the most progressive countries in the world. “I think it’s time New Zealand moved towards being a more compassionate and tolerant society,” Seymour told the Guardian. “People continue to suffer in ways that are traumatic. I don’t want to have to suffer on to adhere to the morality of someone else. They’ve got their own body if they want to have a ghastly death.” While the results of the euthanasia referendum are binding, the cannabis issue was not, meaning no matter the outcome the government would still need to debate the issue and pass policy through parliament. In the lead-up to the October election polls showed a country divided; with support for legalising cannabis veering between 30-50%. Voters were asked to decide whether they wanted to pass a bill that would legalise cannabis and regulate how it was used and sold. This would include producing and selling fresh and dried cannabis, including plants and seeds – for people over 20 years old. The change would impose more stringent restrictions than the rules around sales of alcohol and tobacco. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said she voted yes on both referendum questions. Ardern recently said she had used cannabis “ a very long time ago”. Former Labour prime minister, Helen Clark, said cannabis prohibition “doesn’t work” and should be abandoned, a position echoed by many leading public health professionals. Cannabis is New Zealand’s most commonly used illicit drug, and the latest New Zealand Health Survey found that 15%, or 590,000 New Zealand adults used cannabis in the past 12 months. Victoria University criminologist Fiona Hutton has worked in harm reduction with cannabis users and said the no vote meant New Zealand’s “most vulnerable and marginalised people will continue to suffer”. “I am quite devastated, to be honest, very very sad,” said Hutton. “People voted no to protect young people and the mentally ill. None of that will happen. All the harms from decriminalisation will carry on unabated.” Māori account for 16% of New Zealand’s population and are shown to be disproportionately affected by New Zealand’s drug laws, facing three times as many arrests and prosecutions for possession of cannabis than non-Māori.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1368,Nice police question man over reported contact with basilica suspect,10/30/20,"Police in Nice are questioning a 47-year-old man reported to have been in contact with a suspected knifeman just hours before he carried out an attack in which three people were killed. The man was taken into custody late on Thursday evening. Police have given no more details and said there is currently no evidence that the knifeman had an accomplice. The suspected attacker, 21-year-old Brahim Aouissaoui from Tunisia, was shot by police and is in a serious condition in hospital in Nice. The development came as France stepped up security across the country and ministers and officials warned further attacks were likely. “We are in a war against an enemy that is both inside and outside,” the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, told RTL radio. “We need to understand that there have been and there will be other events such as these terrible attacks.” As the nation reeled from the murders, tens of thousands joined protests against France in countries from Pakistan and Bangladesh to Lebanon and the Palestinian territories on Friday. Effigies of the French president, Emmanuel Macron were burned over his defence of the right to publish caricatures of the prophet Muhammad, a position that has sparked anger across the Muslim world. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, defended free speech on Friday but added that it was “not without limits” and should not “arbitrarily and needlessly hurt” certain communities. “We will always defend freedom of expression,” Trudeau said in response to a question about the right to show a caricature of the prophet Muhammad, as Charlie Hebdo magazine did. “But freedom of expression is not without limits. We owe it to ourselves to act with respect for others and to seek not to arbitrarily or unnecessarily injure those with whom we are sharing a society and a planet.” French investigators are attempting to establish exactly how and when the suspect arrived in Nice after being refused permission to remain in Italy on 9 October. Aouissaoui’s family told Tunisian journalists on Friday that he had phoned them the day before the attack to say he had just reached Nice and was planning to sleep rough in the city overnight. “He called us Wednesday evening to say he had arrived in France,” a relative at the family home near Sfax said. On Friday, the first day of France’s new Covid-19 lockdown, Macron held an emergency defence council meeting. He announced on Thursday that France’s security threat alert had been raised to the highest level. He also said an extra 4,000 soldiers were being deployed across the country as part of Operation Sentinelle, bringing the total number of troops mobilised to 7,000. Security has been stepped up at churches and other religious sites ahead of All Saints’ Day on Sunday. After the meeting, Darmanin said an additional 3,500 gendarmes were also being drafted in to protect schools when they open after the half-term holiday on Monday, and that 120 extra police would be sent to Nice. The foreign affairs minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, has told French citizens living abroad to be aware that “the threat is everywhere”. He said instructions would be given to French ambassadors to step up security at their embassies. Nice’s police chief, Richard Gianotti said: “Any symbol of the republic or Christianity is a potential target. We have to be vigilant, we have to be attentive.”
The three people who died in the attack were a 60-year-old woman who was almost decapitated, 55-year-old Vincent Loques, who was the church sexton, and Simone Barreto Silva, a 44-year-old Brazilian-born mother-of-three. Mourners lit candles and prayed on Friday to honour the victims. Local police officers have been praised for their quick response in confronting the attacker. The incident lasted 28 minutes and officers afterwards described the scene as a “vision of horror”. Gianotti, said six of his officers were inside the basilica “almost immediately” after the alarm was raised. A police patrol was passing the basilica at the time and was approached by a person who had come out of the church saying someone had been “seriously stabbed”, he said.
The patrol was quickly joined by reinforcements. One team went in through the main entrance and a second entered via the sacristy door. “Those that went in the main entrance saw the 60-year-old woman who was stabbed on the ground. Those who went into the sacristy came immediately across the man who was holding a knife,” Gianotti told BFMTV. “He had just killed three people, he was shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’. One officer shot but missed him. It was done in legitimate defence. “The corridor was quite narrow and he [the attacker] continued to advance. He was quite determined. A second police officer shot at him and brought him down, neutralised him.” Gianotti said two officers used their guns, and they fired around 10 times. “He was neutralised on the ground. The only words he pronounced were ‘Allahu Akbar’.” The police chief said his officers had no idea at that point whether the attacker was wearing a suicide vest or had an accomplice. “We checked him on the ground, he was not wearing a vest. A second municipal police team arrived rapidly with a national police team. It’s hard to imagine but it happened very quickly, in three or four minutes.” Macron was among those who acknowledged the officers’ bravery.
Gianotti said: “When they entered they were going into the unknown. They took measure of the situation and the legal framework of such an intervention … it was a situation of legitimate defence, and they knew they could fire their weapons. They saved lives by being at the scene almost instantly.” He said Nice police were well equipped with bulletproof vests, the means to fire rubber bullets and semi-automatic 9mm Glock pistols with 15 bullets.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1369,Paris region sees record traffic jams ahead of lockdown,10/30/20,"A dash by Parisians to either escape the new national lockdown or scramble back to the French capital to prepare for the restrictions caused record traffic jams on Thursday night. The movement in and out of the city created a record 706km of traffic on roads in the region by 6pm, according to France’s traffic department. France’s new four-week lockdown comes into effect at midnight on Thursday, prompting those who can afford it, or who don’t have children, to leave Paris to spend “reconfinement” in the countryside – and those already on holiday to return en masse.
France’s lockdown comes into effect two days before the end of the All Saints school holidays, which mark the half way point between summer and Christmas. French president Emmanuel Macron said there would be “tolerance” so that “everyone can return from their vacation spot, so that families can organise themselves”. Thursday’s total traffic was nearly 200km longer than the previous record, which was also at the end of the All Saints holiday in 2019, le Parisien reports. Then, the record was was 525km at 6pm. Under the lockdown, people will only be allowed to leave their homes for essential purposes: food shopping, commuting to work if it is not possible to work from home, and medical or imperative family reasons. Outdoor exercise will be allowed for one hour per day and within 1km of home. Schools will remain open, with children aged six and over required to wear masks. Le Figaro reported that several accidents and breakdowns occurred in and around Paris. “Paris traffic is legendary,” wrote one user on Twitter, “but this I’ve never seen.”
Others referred to the traffic as a “mess”, a “madness” and a “hell”.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1370,Plant inspectors and rising prices: UK garden industry set for Brexit shock,10/30/20,"The UK’s love of horticulture has grown during the coronavirus pandemic, but avid gardeners are being warned of a Brexit shock, with rising prices, potential plant shortages and even the need for plant inspectors at nurseries. Every year 55,000 trucks loaded with plants arrive in the UK from the Netherlands alone. Each individual pot or hessian root wrap bears an EU “plant passport”, which allows frictionless cross border trade. But from 1 January, these passports will no longer be valid in Britain. Importers will need to complete their own checks to comply with new UK regulations to certify that each plant is disease- and pest-free, adding costs and delays to suppliers who will now have two layers of red tape to contend with – one for EU customers and one for British nurseries. Andy Moreham, the sales and marketing manager at Joseph Rochford Gardens wholesale plant nursery in Hertfordshire, said the new regime would choke off some supplies from industrial suppliers in the Netherlands.
“They are now going to be exporting at additional cost and some of our suppliers have told us they will not want to do this and they want to just sell their products to the EU,” he said. “I feel sorry for them because they have nothing to do with the UK government’s decisions, it’s going to be difficult for them and for us as it’s been nice to have built up a close working relationship with them over decades.” Strolling through the remainder of this season’s lavenders, hydrangeas and hedging from the Netherlands, Moreham pointed out the EU flags and passports on the plants. He said it was the consumer who would pay for Brexit. “Most likely we will see a 10% increase in costs.” It is no surprise that in a nation of gardeners, the horticulture industry is huge, worth £5bn a year, yet it does not receive the same attention in Brexit talks as farming and fishing.
Joseph Rochford Gardens is a small family business with a turnover of about £4m to £5m. But like many nurseries it relies heavily on imports, with about £1.5m worth of stock coming from the EU. The doubling up of regulations – one for EU buyers and one for British buyers – seemed unnecessary, said Moreham. Some suppliers have told the nursery it could need plant inspectors on site every day to produce the quantity of certificates that would be required for cross-channel trade under the new “independent UK” regulatory system. Each certificate will cost £180 to the supplier, enough to wipe out the small margins on sales. In addition to the health certificates, suppliers will be subject to health inspections at ports and inland border control posts, which are being set up under Michael Gove’s border operation model. Suppliers will also have to supply export declarations to EU authorities for the first time, coupled with customs documentation on arrival in the UK for the first time.
“The cost of inspection at each end, the increased cost of transport, the cost of hiring agents to register each import on the various new software systems for imports, it is likely that there will be a 10% increases in costs,” Moreham said. “Plants are perishable, if our plants get stopped at the harbour for God knows how long, then they will dry out and if they are delayed for a day or two or they decide they need to put them in quarantine, they could deteriorate or die.” Joseph Rochford Gardens is adding £150,000 worth of seedlings and cuttings to its December orders to beat the potential chaos and supply shortages in January, when it would usually grow on for saleable produce in March and April. “Covid has cost us £1m in sales and has long-term consequences,” he said, adding that it had not left any money for capital expenditure that would be needed across the industry to do what the government would like them to do: develop a homegrown business to match that of the Netherlands and obviate the need for so many imports. Moreham’s immediate concern is delays at the borders and a second wave of coronavirus destruction. “Horticulture has been the poor relative to agriculture and doesn’t have the same clout. But we are a multibillion-pound industry, a successful industry that is only going to grow. We are going to have to look at how the industry changes and grows more for our market.”",,Politics,Guardian,4
1371,Polish hospitals begin turning away women seeking abortions,10/30/20,"Hospitals in Poland have been turning away women seeking abortions even though a court ruling that has instituted a near-total ban on terminations has not yet taken effect. The ban, which outlaws one of the three narrow exceptions under which abortion is still permitted – that of severe foetal defects – has sparked huge protests in Poland. Yet hospitals appear to be already falling in line with what campaigners describe as a “cruel and inhumane” judgment. The ruling by the constitutional tribunal on 22 October came after lawmakers from the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) pushed for a review. Since last week, The Federation for Women and Family Planning has received dozens of calls from distressed women, including from those turned away from clinics despite having pre-existing appointments on the grounds of foetal abnormalities. “Most are too distraught to even speak to me,” said the group’s executive director, Krystyna Kacpura. “They start talking and break down in tears. These women need psychological help, their mental health is in very poor shape.” The federation appealed to the mayor of Warsaw to urge hospitals to reverse their policies, and subsequently some, including the Bielański hospital and the Orłowskiego hospital in Warsaw, made a U-turn. One woman from Wrocław in south-western Poland, who is 16 weeks pregnant, was turned away from a local clinic despite a booking and documents confirming the foetus had severe malformations. “She was told there were no beds available and to come back in two weeks,” said Kacpura. “But we know this access soon won’t be possible, and she is already well into her pregnancy.” She tried to advocate on behalf of the distressed caller but said the doctor refused to assist. “He said there are many cases where women change their minds. The attitude to women of some gynaecologists in this country is appalling,” said Kacpura. Kamila Ferenc, a human rights lawyer who has been representing some of the women, said: “They are terrified, they are afraid about the future, they feel humiliated and are so depressed that doctors and hospitals they trust in let them down.” The situation is being exacerbated by rising cases of Covid-19 in Poland. The country of 38 million people reported a record 21,629 new infections on Friday, the health ministry said, and some abortion clinics were already closed because of the pandemic. Given that 97% of the 1,110 legal abortions in Poland last year were performed on the grounds of severe foetal defects, the court ruling means a near-total ban. The other exemptions are if the mother’s life is in danger or in cases of rape or incest. Many women seeking abortions travel abroad to foreign clinics or seek clandestine providers inside Poland. Abortion Without Borders said that since last week’s ruling it had supported 21 Polish women in accessing an abortion outside the country. “We don’t believe there are good or bad reasons to have an abortion but we know a wanted pregnancy diagnosed with a severe abnormality is devastating,” said the organisation’s Mara Clarke. “This tribunal thinks it is best to force women to continue pregnancies that may not be viable … to give birth to sick babies and to watch them die.” In 2016 Jarosław Kaczyński, the PiS leader, said: “We will strive to ensure that even in pregnancies which are very difficult, when a child is sure to die, strongly deformed, women end up giving birth so that the child can be baptised, buried and have a name.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1372,Pro-choice supporters hold biggest-ever protest against Polish government,10/30/20,"About one hundred thousand protesters took to the streets of the Polish capital, Warsaw, on Friday, in the largest demonstration of popular anger directed against Poland’s ruling rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS) since it assumed office in 2015. Protests have been held across the country since Poland’s constitutional tribunal declared earlier this month that abortions in instances where a foetus is diagnosed with a serious and irreversible birth defect were unconstitutional. Such procedures constitute about 96% of legal abortions in Poland, which already has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe. On Wednesday, pro-choice activists called a “women’s strike” that attracted over 400,000 people to protests in over 400 towns and cities across the central European nation.
Just hours before Friday’s protest, Andrzej Duda, Poland’s right-wing president, announced what he described as a “legislative solution” to the political crisis, proposing that terminations in instances where birth defects are terminal would be allowed. Terminations of foetuses with conditions such as Down’s syndrome would be banned, however.
Strongly criticised by Poland’s medical and legal establishments, Duda’s intervention did little to quell the anger that has left the government and its de facto leader, PiS founder Jarosław Kaczyński, reeling. On Friday, tens of thousands of protesters gathered at points across the city, chanting “I think, I feel, I decide” and anti-PiS slogans. The protests, held as the government introduces ever-stricter restrictions in response to a sharp rise in coronavirus infections and fatalities in recent weeks, have been characterised by humorous slogans and placards and the engagement of Poles in their teens and early 20s.
But there were also violent incidents, as bands of nationalists dressed in black attacked protesters on the streets of central Warsaw. According to the Polish police, several of those arrested were carrying knives and batons. Earlier this week, Kaczyński made an address to the nation calling on his supporters to defend churches from the protests, after services were disrupted and in some instances churches defaced during protests last weekend. Some have blamed the PiS leader for implicitly encouraging far-right groups to attack protesters.
On Friday night, having gathered in the centre of Warsaw, tens of thousands of protesters marched north to the leafy suburb where Kaczyński lives, only to be blocked off by hundreds of riot police. “I just spoke to a young woman who told me that she is 24, and that she has done nothing for the last six days except protest,” Maja Wojcikowska, one of the protest’s organisers, told broadcaster TVN. “There is an incredible energy, we are not going to waste it.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1373,Qatar says those behind search of Australian women at Doha airport committed 'illegal actions',10/30/20,"The Qatari government says those responsible for the intimate medical examinations of women at Doha airport did not follow standard procedures and have been referred to the public prosecution office. Women on 10 flights – including 18 women bound for Sydney – were strip-searched in early October after a newborn baby was found dumped in the terminal. Officials said they were looking for evidence that any of the women had recently given birth. The Qatari government’s decision comes in the wake of widespread international outrage, and after official diplomatic complaints from at least three countries whose citizens were affected. Prime minister Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdulaziz Al Thani also said on Friday that the women’s treatment had been “unacceptable”. “I assure you that we will hold those responsible for these acts to account. What took place does not represent Qatar’s laws or values. We will undertake all measures to prevent a recurrence,” he said in a statement on Twitter. The government on Friday said a preliminary investigation into the “attempted murder” of the infant, and subsequent actions taken by airport authorities, had found “standard procedures were violated”. “Those responsible for these violations and illegal actions have been referred to the public prosecution office,” the Qatari government said in a statement. “This incident is the first of its kind at [the airport] which has served tens of millions of passengers without any issues like this before. What took place is wholly inconsistent with Qatar’s culture and values. Qatar is fully committed to the safety and security of all travellers.”
The government expressed the “sincerest apology for what some female travellers went through as a result of the measures”. The final report’s findings will be shared after it is completed “in the very near future”. Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, on Friday night said she welcomed the apology. “The preliminary investigation of Qatar into this incident has shown illegal actions occurred,” she said in a statement. ‘“It is an important step that these offences have been referred to the public prosecution office. Australian passengers will be reassured that Qatar has established a specialised taskforce to review procedures and protocols to ensure there is never a repeat of this incident.” On Wednesday, the government of Qatar said it regretted “any distress or infringement on the personal freedom of any traveller” caused by the decision to conduct intimate medical examinations of women transiting through Doha airport, in what it said was an “urgently-decided search” to find the mother of an abandoned baby. The Australian government confirmed earlier this week that 18 women on the flight from Doha to Sydney were subjected to the compulsory examination including 13 Australian citizens. Passengers on 10 flights leaving Doha on the evening of 2 October were affected. Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, has said the invasive treatment of the women was “unacceptable” and “appalling” and his government would take a strident approach in seeking answers and ensuring it would never be repeated.
The statement issued by the Qatari government on Wednesday came three days after the incident became global news. It said the search was triggered by the discovery of a baby in a trash can at Hamad international airport “concealed in a plastic bag and buried under garbage”. “The baby girl was rescued from what appeared to be a shocking and appalling attempt to kill her,” the statement said. “The infant is now safe under medical care in Doha. This was the first instance of an abandoned infant being discovered in such a condition at HIA – this egregious and life-threatening violation of the law triggered an immediate search for the parents, including on flights in the vicinity of where the newborn was found. While the aim of the urgently-decided search was to prevent the perpetrators of the horrible crime from escaping, the state of Qatar regrets any distress or infringement on the personal freedoms of any traveller caused by this action.” New Zealand has revealed one of its citizens was among the women subjected to invasive pelvic examinations at Doha airport, labelling the action “completely unacceptable”. Two British women were also among the group of travellers searched, UK authorities have confirmed.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1374,QR codes: how an old technology could help contact tracers keep the pandemic in check,10/30/20,"Businesses across Australia are being encouraged or required to keep logs of who has been in their establishment in case of a Covid-19 outbreak. Many choose to use paper and pen to keep records, but increasingly QR code posters are up so people can check in via their phones. What is a QR code? Quick response code is a computer-generated image that looks a bit like a barcode, and when scanned by a phone with a QR code reader (many phones have this built into the camera app), it’ll open a website the code links to. They were designed in Japan in the mid-90s, and became more popular with the broader public with the advent of cameras on smartphones. QR codes never really took off in western countries largely due to the lack of a built-in QR code reader app in the early phases of Apple’s iOS iPhone software. Now in a pandemic, with the need for retailers and other businesses to quickly get check-in infrastructure in place, QR codes are having a renaissance. Apple’s iOS camera app also supports QR code scanning. On Android 9 and above, Google Lens allows people to scan QR codes. How does it keep a record of where I’ve been? Restaurants, cafes, bars and shops will link their QR codes to a Google form or a website that keeps logs of who has been there and at what time, and their contact details in case someone tests positive. What information do they need? Ideally they need only your name, and a contact number or email address, and the time you are there.
What information they do collect, however, will vary depending on the system being used, and the jurisdiction. In New South Wales, the ACT and South Australia, only name and contact details and time of visit is required. In Victoria, just a first name and a phone number and time of visit must be recorded. In Queensland, name, address or email address and phone number must be collected. The length of time the records are held also differs. Queensland requires the data to be held for 56 days. NSW, South Australia and the ACT require a minimum of 28 days. In Victoria, the records must be destroyed as soon as practicable after 28 days. In Western Australia, no register is required to be kept in the current phase of restrictions. The NT and Tasmania also do not appear to require record keeping in their health orders. But beyond the basic requirements – unless specifically prohibited by public health orders – the businesses can collect more information, and if you agree by checking a box when you sign in can use the information to market to you. Myguestlist, for example, which is one of the most common to be used in Sydney, advises that businesses can access the contact records of those who opt in to receiving marketing information. Other third-party services that have been reported being used in NSW include Kounta, Covidcomply, Visitsafe, Guesthq, Medallia, and Guesttrack. Big companies such as Woolworths and Kmart have implemented their own check-in service. With most of the cases of community transmission of Covid-19 in NSW and Victoria, the focus will be on what they are doing to use the check-in records for contact tracing. What is NSW doing? In September, the NSW government released an update to the Service NSW app to allow people to check in to a venue using a QR code. The data on date and time is kept by the NSW government and deleted after 28 days, unless it is needed by NSW Health for contact tracing. As of 30 October, 13,500 businesses have downloaded a QR code to print out and use for customer check-ins, and there have been 1m check-ins on the app. On Friday, the government announced taxis in NSW would also allow people to check in via the app. Due to the delay in getting the app out to market, several months after NSW venues began reopening it is just one of many used by businesses. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, indicated in early October she was considering mandating businesses to use the Service NSW app. What is Victoria doing? The Victorian premier said this week that the state government would “soon” release its own QR code check-in application for businesses in Victoria. Daniel Andrews said it was being built from scratch, and would integrate with the new Salesforce contact tracing system, meaning health officials would have easy access to a store’s records when needing to find people to contact. Andrews has said he wants the QR code system to be universal in the state, but it is not yet clear whether businesses will be encouraged to take it up or if it will become mandatory. What are other jurisdictions doing? In the UK, a QR code check-in app is built into the NHS contact tracing app. Singapore had been using QR codes for entry into venues, but that will now be integrated into the TraceTogether app, which Australia’s Covidsafe app is based on. The Australian Digital Transformation Agency, which built Australia’s Covidsafe contact tracing app, has indicated it would not be possible to include a QR code check-in feature in the Covidsafe app. Its chief executive, Randall Brugeaud, told a Senate estimates hearing on Thursday that because of strict privacy legislation governing the use of data around the app, it would not be allowed to record location information. He said such an update would otherwise be technically easy for the agency to bring in.
New Zealand has the NZ Covid tracer app, which acts more like a digital diary. When you go to a venue, you scan a QR code and it makes a record on your phone. You can sign up to alerts and be notified when a venue you have attended was also attended by someone infectious with Covid. A person who tests positive can share their diary with a contact tracer so those alerts can be sent out. It means none of the restaurants, bars or cafes keep a record of who has been there. Which method is best? From a privacy standpoint, the New Zealand version is the best around, but means health officials won’t be able to directly contact those who were close contacts and ensure they isolate and get tested. The NSW and Victorian versions are better on the public health side of things because if the government holds the records, that information will be available as soon as it is needed rather than finding the business, and extracting the records from whichever of the many varieties of system that business may be using. The other benefit of logging in via a government app is that malicious QR codes that direct people to fake login websites designed to take people’s information are less likely to work, given in the app people will not have to fill out their details. The government apps also mean your personal details will not end up being used for marketing. The check-in systems developed by private companies may offer individual businesses benefits, but the lack of a single check-in system across the board means people will need to sign in with multiple companies sometimes multiple times a day. The more check-ins with multiple companies, the greater the risk of a potential data misuse if even one of the companies suffers from a data breach.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1375,Refugee agencies call for action on people smuggling after 140 die in shipwreck,10/30/20,"UN refugee and migration agencies have called for renewed efforts to tackle people-smuggling and trafficking gangs, and to protect those they exploit, after at least 140 people died off the coast of Senegal in the deadliest shipwreck recorded this year. The deaths, which followed four shipwrecks in the central Mediterranean last week and another in the Channel, come amid a huge rise in the number of migrants and refugees using the dangerous Atlantic route from Africa to the Canary Islands. According to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), a vessel carrying 200 people left the Senegalese coastal town of Mbour last Saturday, bound for the Canary Islands. A few hours into the journey, the boat caught fire and capsized near Saint-Louis on Senegal’s north-west coast. Fifty-nine people were rescued by nearby fishing vessels and the Senegalese and Spanish navies, and the bodies of 20 others were recovered.
A survivor of the wreck said it had been impossible to count the number of passengers on the boat, a narrow craft called a pirogue more usually used for fishing. Many were from Saint-Louis, where entire streets were plunged into mourning by the tragedy. Rescued by Spanish coastguards before being handed over to Senegalese authorities, the 20-year-old told local media that “when it blew up, it was everyone for themselves to escape and survive”. He described catching hold of a plastic jerry can, throwing it into the water and then diving in after it. “It was a fight for the jerry cans,” he said. “I spent three hours hanging on to it. When the boat exploded I saw people, possibly dead, either side of me, but I was only thinking about saving myself.” The incident on Saturday was followed by another early on Monday in which a Senegalese navy vessel struck a boat filled with migrants when it tried to escape a patrol. Authorities said they were able to save “only 39” people. More are presumed to have drowned. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said the Atlantic route was growing in popularity once again because of enduring conflicts, land border closures due to coronavirus and increased controls in some north African countries. “This is a trend that’s going to continue – especially given the current context,” said María Jesús Vega, a spokeswoman for UNHCR Spain. “We need to do a lot more to fight these merciless mafias, who are already reorganising themselves to play with people’s lives.” Even before reaching an overcrowded boat, said Vega, many people were tortured and abused by the gangs. “Then there’s the crossing itself, which is very long and dangerous and which can take days or even weeks. This is the deadliest route. Some of these boats are fully packed with people – 100, 200 per boat – so people are really risking their lives all over again.” Vega said that unlike the crisis in 2006, when about 32,000 people arrived in the Canaries, NGOs were seeing “mixed flows”, with more refugees braving the Atlantic route along with migrants. Interviews with 130 men and women in August revealed that many were fleeing conflict or indiscriminate violence in the Sahel region, while others said their already precarious situation had been worsened by the pandemic. “The proportions vary, but more than 30% of these people are from Mali. There are also a lot of Moroccans and as well as people from Ivory Coast, Senegal and Guinea,” said Vega. “The majority are men, but 20% are women and 12% are children. There wasn’t a significant number of women in the 2006 crisis.” Vega said that while the number of arrivals, compounded by the pandemic, was putting the Canaries’ reception infrastructure under huge strain, “a good, coordinated response” was required from the local, regional and central governments. She said interpreters and legal advisers needed to be on hand to identify, help and protect people who may be entitled to asylum and who could be at risk if returned. Bakary Doumbia, IOM’s Senegal mission chief, also called for a united front to tackle the people smugglers and traffickers. “We call for unity between governments, partners and the international community to dismantle trafficking and smuggling networks that take advantage of desperate youth,” he said. “It is also important that we advocate for enhanced legal channels to undermine the traffickers’ business model and prevent loss of life.” IOM said that in September alone, 14 boats carrying a total of 663 migrants left Senegal for the Canary Islands. More than a quarter of the departures were reported to have experienced an incident or shipwreck. This week, the Senegalese government said it was also concerned by the number of people trying to reach Europe by sea. “The government has noted with regret the resurgence of clandestine emigration by sea,” it said in a statement, adding that navy patrols had rescued 388 people at sea between 7 and 23 October. According to IOM figures, 11,006 people have arrived in the Canaries since January this year, with 4,925 arrivals in October alone. Last year, 2,557 migrants arrived in the archipelago, up from 1,307 in 2018. An estimated 414 people have died trying to reach the Canaries so far this year – almost double the 210 deaths recorded in 2019. In an interview with the Guardian this week, Spain’s secretary of state for migration said the issue required a coordinated international response. “It’s clear that everyone realises that we won’t be able to deal with this phenomenon unless we work in countries of origin,” said Hana Jalloul. “But we also need to focus on the mafias who abuse these people and push a dream that ends in death at sea.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1376,Slovakia to test all citizens over age of 10 for coronavirus,10/30/20,"Slovakia’s government has involved the military in a three-week programme to test every citizen over the age of 10 for coronavirus. A three-day pilot was run last week in four regions in the north of the country, and further mass testing will take place this weekend and next with the aim of reaching 4 million adults and isolating those who have the disease. The army will assist 20,000 medical staff working across thousands of testing sites. Results will be given within roughly half an hour of a sample being taken. People who test positive will have the option of quarantining for 10 days at home or moving into a facility provided by the government. Those not willing take the antigen test will have to self-isolate for 10 days or face a €1,650 (£1,485) fine. Everyone tested will receive a certificate, and police will conduct spot checks to find anyone seeking to avoid the process. Ministers have said the country’s hospitals could be on the brink of collapse within weeks. The number of infections has risen steeply since the end of the summer, after the country came through the first wave of the disease in the spring relatively unscathed. There were 2,785 new cases of infection recorded on Wednesday, compared with 231 a month ago. The prime minister, Igor Matovič, outlined the approach to his fellow EU leaders during a summit held via videoconference on Thursday evening. The European council president, Charles Michel, who chaired the meeting, said: “The prime minister explained what the strategy is in his country regarding the rapid test … He will share the outcome of the result of this strategy, this project, to organise on a very broad basis testing in order to be able to isolate and in order to be able share with us after that the data.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1377,Starmer says Corbyn could have predicted suspension for EHRC response,10/30/20,"Keir Starmer has said Jeremy Corbyn could have predicted that his decision to play down the extent of antisemitism in Labour would lead to disciplinary action, and added that it was theoretically possible the former leader could be expelled from the party. In a round of media interviews as Labour descended into infighting following Corbyn’s suspension for saying that antisemitism in Labour had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons”, Starmer insisted he had had nothing to do with this disciplinary process. But asked if possible disciplinary action against Corbyn could include expulsion, Starmer said: “Yes, people have been expelled from the Labour party.” Of 827 cases connected to antisemitism dealt with since he took over as leader in April, Starmer said, a third had been kicked out of the party. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “But it’s not for me to say what process should be followed, that’s for the general secretary, or what sanction is in order. I don’t want a civil war in the Labour party. I don’t think there’s any need for one. I want to unite the party. But I’m not going to renege on my commitment to root out antisemitism.” Starmer said he had spelled out to Corbyn on Wednesday evening how he intended to respond to the damning report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which found Labour responsible for three legal breaches over antisemitism. “I’m deeply disappointed in that response from Jeremy Corbyn yesterday not least because I spoke to him the night before the report to set out how I intended to deal with it,” he told Today. “And from discussions yesterday morning I’m in no doubt that Jeremy Corbyn and his team knew exactly what I was going to say in my response about not only antisemitism but the denial and the arguments about exaggeration, and it’s just a factional fight. “That is why appropriate action was taken yesterday by the general secretary in suspending Jeremy Corbyn. That’s the right acton – very difficult action, but the right action, which I fully support.”
Speaking earlier, Starmer told BBC One’s Breakfast that the decision was made at about 1pm on Thursday by Labour’s general secretary, David Evans, as a result of Corbyn’s rebuff of criticism in the EHRC report. The Labour leader, who took over from Corbyn in April, and has accepted in full the EHRC’s findings, said he had not spoken to his predecessor since the report was published. He said: “What I had hoped would happen yesterday is that we could accept what was going to be a very difficult day, draw a line in the sand and move on. “And I’ve spoken extensively to Jewish communities, Jewish leaders over the last six months. That’s what they wanted to happen yesterday, an ability to recognise the hurt, draw a line and move on. “That’s what I hoped would have happened yesterday. As it happens it took a different turn of events because of Jeremy Corbyn’s response.” Corbyn has pledged to fight the suspension, and is rallying allies, including supportive MPs and friendly unions, including Unite, which is Labour’s biggest financial supporter. Asked about the former leader’s future in the party, Starmer declined to comment, saying it was “very important that I don’t now comment on what is going to happen in the process”. Asked whether he believed Corbyn was himself antisemitic, he indicated not: “I don’t see Jeremy Corbyn in that light. Neither did the commission report make any findings, individually, about things that Jeremy had said or done.” The EHRC said Labour under Corbyn was responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act, connected to harassment, political interference in antisemitism complaints and inadequate training for those handling the complaints. Challenged on what he did while serving as shadow Brexit secretary to try to change the party’s actions, Starmer said he had spoken out, both privately and in public, adding: “Within the shadow cabinet you have responsibility, and I accept that. And we all have to accept the findings yesterday, and apologise for them.” Asked why he did not resign, he said: “I thought it was important to have voices in the shadow cabinet.”",,Politics,Guardian,4
1378,Suspect in Nice terror attack phoned his family hours before rampage,10/30/20,"The 21-year-old Tunisian man who is accused of using a kitchen knife to kill three people in a church in Nice spoke to his family 12 hours before the attack, giving no indication he was contemplating violence. Brahim Aouissaoui grew up among eight sisters and two brothers in a modest home on a potholed road in Thina, a working-class neighbourhood in an industrial zone close to Sfax, a major port on Tunisia’s eastern coast. Sfax is 80 miles (130km) from the small Italian island of Lampedusa and a key point of departure for Tunisians attempting the crossing to Europe. Aouissaoui abandoned his education while at high school and worked as a bicycle mechanic before launching a roadside business selling small quantities of petrol to motorists, family members said. Authorities said Aouissaoui’s occasionally violent behaviour and drug use had brought him to the attention of local police. “He drank alcohol and used drugs. I told him: ‘We don’t have enough and you, you waste money?’” Gamra Issawi, Aouissaoui’s mother, said. She said her son responded: “If God wills it, he will direct me to the right path, that’s my business.”
Over the last two years, relatives noted a change in Aouissaoui’s behaviour. He began praying regularly, staying at home and shunning the company of former friends. But he “never showed extremism”, said Yassin, an older brother. “He respected all other people and accepted their differences even since he was a child.” Aouissaoui had begun to think about leaving Sfax and Tunisia, and made at least one abortive attempt to cross the Mediterranean to reach Italy. He did not warn his family that he was going to try a second time. “He did not tell … and we were surprised when he told us he had reached Italy,” Yassin said. According to prosecutors in Tunisia and Sicily, Aouissaoui disappeared on 14 September and arrived on the island of Lampedusa on 20 September on a small fishing boat with 20 other young male Tunisians. There were favourable sea conditions that day and a total of 26 boats arrived on Lampedusa over 24 hours, each carrying between 10 and 20 people. Aouissaoui was questioned by police upon arrival who noted no indication of distress or cause for alarm, according to sources cited by la Repubblica. Italian officials told local media Aouissaoui had never been on the Tunisian police’s watch list and was not on the radar of intelligence organisations. Tunisian officials confirmed Aouissaoui was not listed by their security services, and French investigators said he was unknown there. Italian investigators confirmed to the Guardian that on 23 September Aouissaoui was on deck five of the Covid-19 quarantine ship Rhapsody, with 804 others. The result of his swab test was negative, and on 9 October the Rhapsody docked at the Adriatic port of Bari in Italy, where Aouissaoui was photographed and registered by the authorities. Italian prosecutors also confirmed that Aouissaoui had no papers with him at that time. According to Italian investigators, after being questioned by the police in Bari, Aouissaoui spent more than 10 days in Sicily, presumably in Palermo. Prosecutors in Palermo and Bari have launched an investigation. The high number of arrivals from Tunisia means repatriation procedures from Italy are often delayed. Instead, Tunisians are given a written order requiring them to leave Italy within seven days. About 50 people a week are transferred to a guarded migrant centre before being escorted back to Tunisia by plane but the rest are released, said Fulvio Vassallo Paleologo, a professor of asylum law at the University of Palermo. Aouissaoui received the order to leave Italy but his movements were not monitored. He may have travelled illegally through Ventimiglia on the French border. He had called his family at about 8pm on Wednesday to tell them he was in France. “He said he had decided to go to France because there were better work prospects and there were too many people [seeking employment] in Italy,” his brother said. Aouissaoui’s sister, Afef, said he had sought out Notre-Dame church in Nice when looking for a place to sleep, and told her he planned to rest in a building opposite. He had shown no sign that he was planning any kind of attack, she said, but 12 hours later allegedly entered the church and killed two women and a man with a knife. Aouissaoui, who was carrying two phones and a Qur’an in addition to the weapon, was shot by police. He is in a critical condition and under heavy guard in hospital.
French police have arrested a 47-year-old man who was in contact with Aouissaoui on Wednesday evening, though officials said there was no evidence of any complicity. Tunisians were involved in eight plots in France between 2014 and mid-2019, as well as four elsewhere in Europe, according to Aaron Zelin, the author of a recent book on extremism in the country. A major attack was carried out by a Tunisian man on Bastille Day in Nice in 2016. He drove a truck into a crowd, killing 86 people. Though the 2011 revolution brought Tunisia democracy and freedom of expression, it did not translate into an improvement in living standards or economic opportunity, and increasing numbers of young people have sought to emigrate. In September, Italy said the number of migrants arriving over the past year in boats across the Mediterranean had risen by half.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1379,The face mask test: which are the best at limiting the spread of Covid?,10/30/20,"Some fabric face coverings on sale in supermarkets and high-street pharmacies could be giving people a false sense of security by letting the vast majority of large particles pass through them, an investigation by the consumer magazine Which? has revealed. Three of the masks the magazine’s researchers tested failed to capture 93% of bacterial particles, meaning that these particles could be inhaled or exhaled by the mask wearer. However, it was found that the best-performing face coverings were as good as surgical masks at blocking bacterial particles, preventing more than 99% of them from penetrating the fabric. Although reusable fabric masks are not intended to block ultra-fine particles such as viruses, they are designed to trap larger respiratory droplets and aerosols which the wearer breathes, coughs or spits out, so can minimise the transmission of any virus particles that they contain.
“With face coverings now such an important part of daily life they not only need to be durable and comfortable, but also provide effective filtration from harmful particles in order to keep us and others safe,” said Natalie Hitchins, Which? head of home products and services. “Our results prove that there is a huge difference in quality between reusable masks sold in stores around the country and online.” The researchers looked at a range of popular brands and styles of face coverings on sale in the UK, testing them for breathability, durability and comfort as well as the ability to filter bacteria. Bacterial particles were shot out of an aerosol generator and the proportion that made it through the mask fabric were measured. Measuring three micrometers in diameter the bacteria used were about 30 times larger than coronavirus particles, but the results were likely to be relevant to Covid-19 nevertheless, independent researchers said. “Chances are that if they let bacteria through they’ll also let virus through,” said Cath Noakes, a professor and expert in airborne disease transmission at the University of Leeds. “Although much smaller than a bacteria the virus will be contained in respiratory aerosols and droplets, which are larger. We are probably most concerned with aerosols that are 1-50 microns in diameter, so a bacteria is a reasonable proxy for the size range that is likely to matter.” In a separate study, published in BMJ Open, Eugenia O’Kelly, at the University of Cambridge, and colleagues, tested the ability of various fabrics, ranging from T-shirts and socks, to jeans and vacuum bags, to trap virus-sized particles, when emitted at high speeds. These high speeds were comparable to the velocity of the air exhaled during coughing or heavy breathing. O’Kelly found that masks made of multiple layers of fabric were more effective, trapping 45% of particles, compared with 35% for single-layer fabric masks. Adding a layer of non-woven fusible interfacing – such iron-on webbing used to stiffen garments – added an additional 11% to a mask’s filtration ability, though this affected breathability. James Ward, a University of Cambridge engineer, who was also involved in the research, said: “I think when you’re purchasing a face covering or mask you want to consider more than just price, but a balance between multiple things, including filtration, breathability, durability, fit, long-term comfort and safety. Layering of fabrics is a good idea, but you’ve got to consider the trade-off between filtration and breathability. Which? awarded Best Buy status to two of the products it tested – the NEQI reusable face mask (available from Boots and Ocado), and Bags of Ethics Great British Designer face coverings (available at Asos and John Lewis). Although these masks did not receive the highest filtration scores, they were considered comfortably breathable, whereas the masks which scored five out of five for filtration received low breathability scores. Breathability is especially important for people who wear glasses because condensation from trapped breath can cause lenses to steam up, encouraging people to pull down or remove their masks. “As winter approaches, the air is getting colder, so glasses will steam up more easily,” Ward said. Which? awarded two masks the highest rating for comfort while wearing glasses – the Asos and AB Mask. It found that the worst performing masks were made from a single layer of fabric, mostly polyester. Though lightweight and breathable, these masks were not as good at filtering particles. It also discovered that the filtration of almost all the face coverings improved after being washed at high temperatures, due to the fibres in the fabrics compressing. O’Kelly warned, however, that masks should not be reused indefinitely as repeated washing can degrade the fabrics.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1380,The US election that doesn't count: Guam goes to the polls but votes won't matter,10/30/20,"Politics is a favourite sport on the streets of Hagatna, where voters are preparing for the US elections. Billboards adorn every street corner and conversations are dominated by candidates and their policies. But when Guamanians go to the polls on 3 November and mark down their preference for president, their “votes” won’t count. Despite being American citizens, an anomaly in US law means the residents of the island, which lies in the Pacific Ocean 8,000 miles from Washington, have no say as to who runs their country.
They vote for a local legislature, a governor, and a delegate to the US House of Representatives – a delegate who cannot vote – but their choice for president, marked on the same ballot, carries no weight. Guam’s is a straw poll: a non-binding four-yearly exercise that serves merely as an early barometer for how the rest of the nation will vote. Guam residents are among the 4 million disenfranchised Americans living in US territories who can’t vote for president. And being left out of the election stings. “I am deeply unhappy that as a US citizen formerly residing on the mainland, I have to give up my voting rights for president simply by moving to another part of the US,” James Hofman, a corporate lawyer who moved to Guam from California in 2006, told The Guardian. Guam, “where America’s day begins” – as the island’s slogan goes - is 14 hours ahead of Washington, DC. “It might have some symbolic value, but until there is a direct nexus between our political will and some reciprocal action and engagement by DC it’s not very meaningful,” Hofman said of the straw poll.
While they may not be as emotionally invested in the presidential election as they are in local politics, the island’s voters don’t mind taking the time to pick their choice for president for what it’s worth. “If you’re already in the voting booth, you might as well register your opinion. What’s one more oval to shade?” Tes Venzon, an accountant from Agana Heights, said. Tony Azios, spokesperson for Progressive Democrats of Guam, said the presidential straw vote “amounts to little more than a fun activity and a quirky quadrennial [news] item”. But Guam’s straw-poll has proven a remarkable bellwether: in every election from 1984 to 2012, Guamanians voted for the ultimate presidential winner. In 2016, the island backed Hillary Clinton, the winner of the popular vote. Guam’s exclusion from national elections is a political anomaly that some find baffling, given that American citizens living abroad are eligible to vote by absentee ballot. “It was very simple for me in 2008 to send in my ballot by mail while living in South Korea,” Azios said. “But now that I live in Guam, which has been a part of the United States for roughly 120 years, I cannot vote. It’s absurd.” While some are consoled with Guam’s exemption from paying the federal income tax, many believe such a waiver is not commensurate to the island’s oft-repeated strategic importance to national defence. Guam, which is home to naval and air force bases, is known as the “tip of the US military spear,” and, with a burgeoning Chinese presence in the Pacific, it will grow increasingly geo-strategically valuable.
In coming years, around 5000 marines will be relocated to Guam from Okinawa in Japan as part of the Pentagon’s Indo-Pacific troop realignment program. Guamanians enlist in the US military at a higher rate than any US state. One in every 20 of Guam’s 165,000 residents is a military veteran, according to the US census. “So why shouldn’t we be able to help select the commander-in-chief?” Azios asked.
Guam’s only formal participation in national elections are the state caucuses held by the island’s Republican and Democratic parties, to choose delegates to send to the parties’ national conventions. Guam is one of the 16 remaining colonies in the 21st century – alongside other US territories such Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and US Virgin Islands - whose representatives to the US Congress does not have a voting power. The island’s representative can introduce bills and push for the territory’s agenda at the congressional committee level, but has no vote on the floor. “I consider myself an American and if you want my personal opinion, of course I want to vote for president,” said Senator Wil Castro, a Republican who is running for the representative seat. “But I am not going to take it upon myself to assume that every Guamanian wants to vote for president. We might have to consult the legislature and the governor before pushing for a congressional agenda. It’s not for me to decide.” Last month, six residents of Guam and the US Virgin Islands sued the US government in federal court, challenging the territories’ exclusion from presidential elections. “The next congress may have an historic opportunity to finally address the denial of voting rights to the nearly 4 million US citizens who live in territories,” said Neil Weare, founder of Equally American, a nonprofit group that advocates for the political rights of US territories. “Whether it takes statehood or a constitutional amendment, congress and the president must act to end over 120 years of disenfranchisement.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1381,UN urges UK to restart resettlement of refugees after family drowns in Channel,10/30/20,"The UK government needs to urgently restart its resettlement scheme after two young children and their parents died while trying to cross the Channel, the UN refugee agency’s UK representative has said. Iranian Kurds Rasul Iran Nezhad and his wife, Shiva Mohammad Panahi, both 35, and two of their children, Anita, nine, and Armin, six, drowned on Tuesday as they tried to reach Britain by boat. The fate of the family’s third child, 15-month-old Artin, is unknown. Their deaths have led to renewed calls for the UK government to abandon its hardline approach to asylum seekers and expand or create safe and legal routes for migrants fleeing torture and death to travel to the UK and claim for protection. One such route would be the UK’s global resettlement scheme, which facilitates the transfer of recognised refugees from an asylum country to the UK with the aim of permanent settlement. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) assesses and grants refugee status. The scheme, which is supposed to resettle about 5,000 refugees a year, has been suspended because of the Covid-19 pandemic. UNHCR’s UK representative, Rossella Pagliuchi-Lor, said: “UNHCR hopes that resettlement to the UK will restart very soon, once reception capacity is confirmed and any remaining logistical issues related to Covid are overcome by the authorities. The pandemic has presented new, acute hardships and uncertainties for refugees. “The tragic events in the Channel this week demonstrate again the need for concerted international efforts to address the complex root causes of displacement. Reopening and expanding legal pathways for more refugees to come to the UK in safety is one tangible way that this country can help.” Pagliuchi-Lor’s intervention comes as UNHCR launches a series highlighting the benefits of the UK’s community sponsorship programme. The programme, which has been running since 2016, enables community groups to become directly involved in supporting refugee families resettled in the UK through the currently suspended resettlement programme. “Community sponsorship is transformative,” said Pagliuchi-Lor. “It provides refugee families with a support network to help them adapt, learn and become independent more quickly. “But it also has a real effect on local volunteers, binding them together in a common cause and allowing them, in a small way, to be part of the global solution to forced displacement.” UNHCR travelled the UK last year chronicling the lives of five refugee families and their community supporters in Wales, Devon, Liverpool, Greater Manchester and London, and has pulled together images and videos for a series illustrating the scheme. More than 7,400 people have arrived in the UK in small boats this year, according to analysis by PA Media, nearly four times as many as in 2019. A record 416 arrived on a single day on 2 September. Seven migrants have died trying to cross the Channel this year, three more than last year. UNHCR joins groups such as Safe Passage, Amnesty and Choose Love/Help Refugees in calling for safe alternatives to the government’s current focus on physically obstructing the crossings. Other options, such as cross-border family reunion arrangements, are the best way to reduce the number of attempted crossings, the groups have said, although the UK government rejected amendments to its immigration bill as recently as last week that would have ensured that rights under British law to family reunion continued after the Brexit transition period. The Home Office has been approached for comment.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1382,World leaders condemn Nice attack as France terror alert level raised to maximum,10/30/20,"Leaders from around the world have offered condolences and expressed their solidarity with the people of France after the nation suffered a second suspected Islamist extremist attack on its soil in a fortnight. President Emmanuel Macron said France was “under attack” in the wake of the killings inside the Notre-Dame basilica in the coastal city of Nice on Thursday which left three worshippers dead, but he vowed the French people would “not give in to any terror” in fighting intolerance. As the government raised the terror alert level to the maximum “emergency” level nationwide, and soldiers were deployed to guard schools and churches in France, UK prime minister Boris Johnson said he was appalled to hear of the “barbaric attack”.
“Our thoughts are with the victims and their families, and the UK stands steadfastly with France against terror and intolerance.” Pope Francis said he mourned the attack “that sowed death in a place of prayer and consolation”. “I pray for the victims, for their families and for the beloved French people, that they may respond to evil with good.” US president Donald Trump said: “America stands with our oldest ally in this fight.” Australian prime minister Scott Morrison also spoke out in support of France.
Condemnation also came from Middle East, Arab and Islamic leaders, who drew a clear distinction between their religion and violent acts that claimed to defend it. Turkey, which is embroiled in a row with France over publication of cartoons of the prophet Muhammad that have triggered a wave of attacks against French people, was among the first to respond to the attack. “We strongly condemn the attack committed today inside the Notre-Dame church in Nice,” a Turkish foreign ministry statement said. Egypt’s foreign ministry said it “stands as a government and people with ... France in combatting this hateful incident”. Iran’s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said “peace cannot be achieved with ugly provocation”. Thursday’s alleged attacker, a 21-year-old Tunisian named as Brahim Aouissaoui, who entered Europe through Italy and travelled to Paris in early October, was shot by police and arrested inside the church.
Aouissaoui allegedly walked into the basilica just before 8.30am on Thursday carrying three knives and a copy of the Qur’an in a bag. The attack lasted 28 minutes and left two people dead and a third fatally injured. The eldest victim was a 60-year-old woman who had been in the basilica praying since shortly after it opened that morning. France’s anti-terrorist prosecutor Jean-François Ricard said she had her throat cut “to the point of being almost decapitated”. Vincent Loqués, 55, also had his throat cut. His body was found inside the church. Loqués was a devout Catholic and had been sexton at the basilica where he prepared the sacraments and altar for the mass for 10 years. His role was also to welcome visitors and worshippers to the basilica when it opened each morning. The third victim was 44-year-old mother of three named in Brazilian media as Simone Barreto Silva, who was stabbed several times inside the basilica. Severely injured, she managed to flee the church before collapsing in a nearby bar. She told those who were treating her: “Tell my children I love them” before dying at the scene. Police described the scene as a “vision of horror”.
Officers who were first at the scene shot the killer several times after he reportedly refused to drop the knife, injuring him in the shoulder. By 9.10am the attacker had been “neutralised”. French officials praised the prompt police action in preventing further bloodshed. The national anti-terrorist prosecutor has opened an investigation into “killings linked to a terrorist organisation”. Aouissaoui reportedly entered France from Italy. Investigators have established he was registered at Lampedusa in Italy on 20 September and had been at the Italian Adriatic port of Bari on 9 October. He was not carrying any identity papers apart from a document from the Italian Red Cross. Ricard said the man was picked up by CCTV cameras at Nice station at 6.47am. “He changed his jacket and his shoes. He then walked 400m to Notre-Dame basilica. He entered at 8.29am,” the prosecutor said. After worshippers fleeing the church raised the alarm, four municipal police officers entered the church at 8.57am.
The attacker advanced towards the officers in “a threatening manner, shouting Allahu Akbar, forcing them first to use an electric pulse pistol and then firing their service weapon several times,” the prosecutor said. Fourteen bullet casings were found on the ground. Thursday’s attack came 13 days after an 18-year-old man beheaded Samuel Paty, 47, a history teacher, outside his high school north-east of Paris. The professor had shown pupils caricatures, including one of the prophet Muhammad published in the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, during a discussion on freedom of speech. Macron promised after Paty’s murder to crack down on Islamist extremism, including shutting down mosques and other organisations accused of fomenting radicalism and violence. His comments sparked angry protests across the Muslim world and calls for a boycott of French goods. Having flown to Nice following the attacks, and visiting the basilica, Macron was sombre but defiant in his response on Thursday. “It is France that is under attack,” the president said. “Three of our compatriots died at the basilica in Nice today and at the same time a French consular site was attacked in Saudi Arabia.
“I want to express, first and foremost, the nation’s support for the Catholics of France and elsewhere… We are at their side in order that religion can be freely exercised in our country. People can believe or not believe, all religions can be practised, but today the nation is beside our Catholic compatriots. “My second message is to … the people of Nice who have already suffered as a result of the Islamist terrorist folly. This is the third time terrorism has struck your city and you have the support and solidarity of the nation. “If we have been attacked once again, it is because of our values, our taste for freedom; the freedom to believe freely and not give in to any terror. We will give in to nothing. Today we have increased our security to deal with the terrorist threat.” Macron said the French military was being mobilised to protect all places of worship, particularly Catholic churches, for the religious holiday of All Saints Day on Sunday. The number of soldiers on the streets is to be raised from 3,000 to 7,000 and troops will be deployed outside schools for the return to class on Monday. France’s security alert has been raised to its highest level, warning of an imminent attack, or in the immediate aftermath of an attack. The elevated alert allows authorities to increase controls, deploy more police and carry out more systematic searches at train stations and airports.",,Foreign,Guardian,4

1399,He just says it as it is': why many Nigerians support Donald Trump,10/31/20,"The pursed, stony expression is familiar in Peter Odoakang’s striking oil painting of Donald Trump, but not the outfit. The US president is portrayed wearing a wine- and peach-coloured agbada and cap, traditional Yoruba attire, fitting him into the mould of a south-western Nigerian leader or “big man”, as Odoakang says. “People see him in agbada and say wow, it fits him. People really laugh about it and react to it,” says Odoakang, 23, of the portrait commissioned by a company in Lagos, which he says brings Trump’s “personality into our setting”. “I’ve been in many offices and seen pictures of Trump, but when you put him in our attire it starts to say something about Nigeria and his influence here,” he says. Portraits of Trump have grown more common among the impressionist depictions of notable figures often sold from open stalls on the streets of Nigeria. In some images he is depicted in his normal suit, and in others in traditional Nigerian clothing or in the green military uniform of former Nigerian dictators. His image strikes a chord in a country where admiration for him is easy to find.
Pew research suggests 58% of people in Nigeria say they have confidence in Trump – the fourth highest total after the Philippines, Israel and Kenya. Trump’s tightening of immigration laws, his reference to “shithole countries” in Africa, and widespread accusations of racism and Islamophobia might be assumed to be reasons for hostility towards him. Yet, although perceptions of Trump vary across Nigeria’s diverse cultural and religious landscape, there is a large affinity towards him, fostered years before he entered politics when his larger-than-life image as a bombastic, straight-talking, self-made billionaire made his books a hit here. “Trump’s popularity in Nigeria probably preceded his becoming president,” says Sa’eed Husaini, a political analyst in Lagos. “Judging by its popularity with traffic hawkers, The Art of the Deal has been a bestseller here for many years now.” Husaini also notes similarities between Nigerian and US politics. “Judging by our own president, it isn’t entirely surprising that a septuagenarian economic nationalist with a born-again vice-president, minimal respect for rule of law and archaic views about women is popular in Nigeria.” Nigeria’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, is 76; its vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo, is a Pentecostal pastor.
At the Church and School Society bookshop in Lagos, the oldest in the country, books by stalwarts of US evangelicalism such as Billy Graham, Joyce Meyer and John C Maxwell line the shelves along with fiction and educational material. Gifted Hands, the autobiography of Ben Carson, the US housing secretary and former neurosurgeon, effusing on how his hard work, intelligence and deeply held faith helped lift him out of poverty, takes pride of place. Trump’s Art of the Deal and Think Big, regularly stocked by the store, are sold out, says the store’s procurement manager, Felix Abiodun. “They don’t stay on the shelves, they go too fast,” he says. Abiodun believes Trump’s often abrasive, off-the-cuff style shows his authenticity. “Some people are careful with what they say, appear holy and do things in secret that you don’t know. But he just says it as it is,” he says. To many in Nigeria’s Anglican community, Trump’s presidency came at a moment “ordained by God”, Abiodun says. “You can see it with the restoration of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, which is what God said in his word, and it has now come to pass.”. Trump’s stated opposition to gay marriage further bolsters this sense, he says.
Trump is not universally popular among Christians in Nigeria, many of whom are critical of allegations of sexual abuse, financial misconduct and association with rightwing white nationalist groups. Yet, especially in Nigeria’s south, some of his most ardent supporters see a god-given imperative behind some of his controversial policies. “With Obama, he prioritised gay rights, abortion, an Islamising agenda. Such policies were not good for America,” Abiodun says. Trump slogans such as “America first”, and policies that disadvantage Nigerian migrants, simply reflect that leaders should put their own countries first too, he says. “Our own leaders have not done that.” Some criticism of Buhari, a Muslim from the country’s north where Islam is more dominant, has been spurred by religious concerns. Accusations of an “Islamisation agenda” and filling powerful positions with northern Muslim figures are common in media commentary.
As insecurity has spread in Nigeria, some influential groups have depicted complex communal and regional conflicts as religious warfare by Muslims against Christians and accused Buhari’s government of complicity. The growth of militancy among Buhari’s ethnic Fulanis has only fuelled simplistic narratives further. Meanwhile, Trump’s outspoken criticism of Christian persecution has not gone unnoticed. In 2018 when Buhari visited the White House, Trump said: “We have had very serious problems with Christians who are being murdered in Nigeria. We are going to be working on that problem very, very hard because we cannot allow that to happen.” Among Biafra secessionists in Nigeria’s south-east, support for Trump is often emphatic. When Trump tweeted in response to Britain’s EU referendum result in 2016 that “self-determination is the sacred right of all free peoples”, many pro-Biafran sites claimed it was veiled support for a Biafran state. Trump is in many ways a useful avatar for many, embodying what they feel is missing in Nigeria. Painting Trump helped attract attention to Odoakang’s craft, which he began when he was 12. “When you see him, he’s a proud figure,” he says, describing how he painted the president’s posture. “He speaks up and doesn’t hold back.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1400,"Add vitamin D to bread and milk to help fight Covid, urge scientists",10/31/20,"Scientists are calling for ministers to add vitamin D to common foods such as bread and milk to help the fight against Covid-19. About two in five people in the UK are estimated to have a vitamin D deficiency in winter, and government guidance that people should take supplements is not working, according to a group convened by Dr Gareth Davies, a medical physics researcher. Low levels of vitamin D, which our bodies produce in response to strong sunlight, may lead to a greater risk of catching the coronavirus or suffering more severe effects of infection, according to some studies. Last week, researchers in Spain found that 82% of coronavirus patients out of 216 admitted to hospital had low vitamin D levels. The picture is mixed, however – some research shows that vitamin D levels have little or no effect on Covid-19, flu and other respiratory diseases. Vitamin D deficiency can cause rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults – soft bones that lead to deformities – and children with severe vitamin D deficiency are prone to hypocalcaemia – low levels of calcium in the blood – which leads to seizures and heart failure. However, Public Health England (PHE) and the Department of Health and Social Care have rejected calls over the past 10 years to fortify foods such as milk, bread and orange juice, which is the practice in Finland, Sweden, Australia, the US and Canada. “In my opinion, it is clear that vitamin D could not only protect against disease severity but could also protect against infection,” Davies said. “Food fortification would need careful planning to be rolled out effectively, particularly as people are now taking supplements. Picking the right foods to fortify would need to be done carefully. “But it’s clear that the current policy is not working.” He said that at least half the population has a vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Adrian Martineau, professor of respiratory infection at Queen Mary University in London, who is not part of Davies’s group, is leading a clinical trial to examine whether vitamin D can reduce the risk of Covid-19, or its severity. The Coronavit study, which began last week and is backed by the Barts Charity, the Fischer Family Trust and the AIM Foundation, will follow more than 5,000 people through the winter. “The government recommends that the whole population takes vitamin D supplements in winter months, and those in high risk groups take it all year round,” Martineau said. “But we know that people just aren’t doing that in any significant numbers. Even I forget to take my supplement sometimes, and I’m living and breathing this subject. Fortification is a really good way of eliminating deficiency.” Our bodies produce vitamin D in response to strong sunlight, and levels of vitamin D deficiency fluctuate throughout the year according to the amount of sunlight. A paper in the British Journal of Family Medicine said as many as 30% to 40% of the UK population is vitamin D deficient in winter, falling to 8% by the end of summer. In the UK, that means that from October to March, people need to rely on other sources: oily fish, eggs and food supplements. Some foods, such as breakfast cereals, are fortified with vitamin D, and people in low-income households are entitled to free multivitamins. White flour in the UK is already fortified with vitamins B1 (thiamin) and B3 (niacin), and last year the government began a consultation on adding vitamin B9 (folic acid) to help prevent spina bifida and other birth defects of the brain and spine. A 2019 study at the University of Birmingham, led by Magda Aguiar, a health economist, showed there would be at least 25% fewer cases of vitamin D deficiency over the next 90 years if flour fortification were adopted, saving about £65m. In 2017, Professor Louis Levy, PHE’s head of nutrition science, responded to calls for fortification by saying that there was not enough evidence that vitamin D would reduce the risk of respiratory infections. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Companies are free to fortify food products with Vitamin D and already do so for a number of foods, including many breakfast cereals. Public Health England advises people to take a Vitamin D supplement during the autumn and winter and this is particularly important this year as many people may have spent more time indoors due to COVID-19.” Recruitment to the clinical study trial at Queen Mary University has recently been extended. Observer readers who would like to find out more should email coronavit@qmul.ac.uk • This article was amended on 1 November 2020 to add a statement from the Department of Health and Social Care, and to remove mushrooms as an example of a food which is fortified with vitamin D. It was further amended on 5 November 2020 to clarify that about two in five people in the UK are estimated to have a vitamin D deficiency in winter; a previous reference to at least half the population having a vitamin D deficiency should have referred to either a deficiency or insufficiency.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1401,Americans go to the polls as US suffers worst week for coronavirus infections,10/31/20,"The US has suffered its worst week for new infections of the entire Covid-19 pandemic just days before the election, underscoring what some epidemiologists described as “life and death” stakes as Americans head to the polls. Scientists have sounded alarms about unabated Covid-19 spread across the midwest, a spread that has the potential to create even more devastation this winter if nothing is done to control the virus. And political divisions are fueling the surge. “There were so many red flags early on that made us vulnerable from day one,” said Natalia Linos, a social epidemiologist who ran in a Democratic primary in Massachusetts this fall and is executive director of the Harvard FXB Center for Health and Human Rights. “We were worried, and it showed from day one this has been a political failure.”
As swing states such as Wisconsin are experiencing “crisis levels” of Covid-19 infections, people have been “driven people further into their camps”, said Katherine J Cramer, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and author of The Politics of Resentment: Rural Consciousness in Wisconsin and the Rise of Scott Walker. “There’s still very strong support for President Trump here, and I think among his supporters they think he’s done a great job handling the pandemic,” said Cramer. “Then, the opposite is the case for people who are leaning toward Joe Biden,” she said. This week marked the worst week in terms of new infections of the pandemic in the US, breaking 500,000 new cases for the first time, according to the Covid Tracking Project. More tests are coming back positive in 47 states, and hospitalizations are climbing in 39 states. More than 1,000 people are dying a day on average, but deaths have not risen as fast as new cases, because they are considered a “lagging indicator”. It often takes weeks between a positive test, hospitalization, death and reporting for victims of Covid-19. A number of coalescing forces could cause dramatic increases in deaths in the coming months, although they are far from inevitable. Scientists believe deaths have not risen in direct correlation with new cases for a few reasons. First, more young people, who are more resilient to the disease, are getting infected. Second, clinicians have found ways to modestly reduce mortality through treatment. Last, and most importantly, hospitals are not yet as overwhelmed as they were at the start of the pandemic. However, if politicians resist enacting containment measures or people refuse to follow them, the virus will spread, and could overwhelm hospitals. Nursing homes are again warning of shortages of personal protective equipment, especially nitrile gloves. Furthermore, government watchdogs said the Trump administration is “woefully behind” in stocking gloves necessary to mitigate spread.
“When scientists say this is life or death – this election – it really is. And it’s not life and death equally for everyone,” said Linos. “One in 10 white Americans know someone who has died of Covid, and one in three black Americans do. That is unfair, unjust and my biggest worry.” Even as cases have increased to record numbers, politicians have shown little political will for more lockdowns. In El Paso, Texas, a local judge declared a two-week lockdown, which was then declared unlawful by the state’s attorney general. In Wisconsin the Democratic governor, Tony Evers, has framed Covid-19 as an “urgent crisis” but described containment measures as a “self-imposed lockdown”, according to local news station WMTV. Meanwhile, Trump has held multiple in-person rallies, playing up the threat of lockdowns while also helping spread the virus. “Biden’s cruel and senseless lockdowns would cause countless deaths from suicide and from all of the problems we have,” Trump told supporters in West Salem, Wisconsin last week. “People lose their jobs.” That is a potent message for supporters, many of whom blame lockdowns (rather than the virus) for devastating local economies. “People perceive that President Trump has been something of a hero in saying, ‘this has to come to an end,’ and ‘we have to get people back to work,’” said Cramer. “With respect to freedom and employment, people think he’s done the right thing.” What is certain is the race will turn on Covid-19. Six in 10 voters consider it a “very big problem”, facing the country. An overwhelming majority of Democrats feel lockdowns were lifted too soon, while a majority of Republicans feel lockdowns were not lifted soon enough, according to a recent analysis of polls in the New England Journal of Medicine. “We’re all so focused on the election but the biggest challenges are in front of us,” said Cramer. The challenge will be “how we actually come together as a state and as a country to deal with this pandemic”.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1402,At least 25 Americans were killed during protests and political unrest in 2020,10/31/20,"At least 11 Americans have been killed while participating in political demonstrations this year and another 14 have died in other incidents linked to political unrest, according to new data from a non-profit monitoring political unrest in the United States. Nine of the people killed during protests were demonstrators taking part in Black Lives Matter protests. Two were conservatives killed after pro-Trump “patriot rallies”. All but one were killed by fellow citizens.
The new data highlights the danger of the presence of guns during politically charged protests, and raises concerns about continued violence during and after election day, when many Americans anticipate delays, confusion and protests before the winner of the presidential race is confirmed. Violence at US protests The new data on fatalities and violence at American protests comes from a database created by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED), a non-profit, working in collaboration with a group of researchers at Princeton. ACLED, a widely cited source for data on civilian casualties in Yemen, has been a non-partisan monitor of protests and violence in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Latin America, and launched its US Crisis Monitor in July, citing concerns over hate crimes and rising political violence. ACLED found that the overwhelming majority of the more than 9.000 Black Lives Matter demonstrations that took place across the US after the killing of George Floyd have been peaceful. News reports at the height of demonstrations over Floyd’s killing cited dozens of deaths in connection with protests, but many of those turned out to be examples of deadly crimes carried out in the vicinity of protests, rather than directly related to the demonstrations themselves, the researchers concluded. ACLED’s dataset only focuses on political violence.
Most of the protesters killed this year were shot to death, and many of the incidents involved confrontations at protests that escalated and turned deadly when at least one of the people involved had a gun. Lee Keltner, a navy veteran who made custom western hats, was shot after a “patriot rally” in Denver on 10 October. Video and photographs of the incident appear to show Keltner slapping a security guard for a local news crew, who responds by pulling out a gun and shooting him. Aaron “Jay” Danielson, a far-right Trump supporter, was shot after a rally in Portland in August. Danielson’s suspected killer, Michael Reinoehl, was a leftwing protester who called himself an “anti-fascist”, and who was later shot to death by law enforcement officials, an outcome Donald Trump referred to as “retribution”. Garrett Foster was reportedly carrying an AK-47 rifle when he was shot to death in July by an armed man who had been driving a car through a crowd of Black Lives Matter protesters in Austin. Whether Foster threatened the driver with his gun is still disputed. The man who shot and killed Foster, the US army sergeant Daniel Perry, had previously tweeted “Now is the time to take up arms and protect yourselves against violence” and responded to a Trump tweet in June about “protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters” by saying, “Send them to Texas we will show them why we say don’t mess with Texas.”
Citing those tweets, analysts at a thinktank that monitors domestic terrorism classified the shooting as an act of “violent far-right” domestic terrorism. But Perry has not yet faced any criminal charges, and a local prosecutor in Texas said the incident was still under investigation. Both Reinoehl and Perry have claimed they were acting in self-defense when they opened fire and that they felt their own lives were in danger. In Kenosha in August, a 17-year-old carrying a rifle he was not old enough to legally possess shot and killed two people, Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, and seriously injured a third at a volatile late-night protest. His lawyer has argued the teenager, who came to Kenosha from Illinois, was also acting in self-defense. In Louisville, the photographer Tyler Gerth was shot and killed at a downtown park where protesters gathered. The alleged shooter, Steven Nelson Lopez, was homeless and had a history of severe mental illness, and had reportedly been asked to leave the park earlier because of his behavior. Many of the protesters in the park were armed and on edge, and returned fire when Lopez started shooting, local news outlets reported. In Las Vegas, Jorge Gomez was wearing body armor and carrying several guns when he was shot to death by Las Vegas police at a protest in June. Before he was shot, several protesters told Gomez they disapproved of him being armed, and even a journalist questioned him about why he was holding his gun in his hand with his finger on the trigger, the Las Vegas Sun reported. Las Vegas police officer Shay Mikalonis was shot in the head during the same protest, and reportedly remains paralyzed from the injury. Officials have said the 20-year-old Las Vegas resident charged in the shooting had not been participating in the protest before the attack, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Other law enforcement officers have been injured in non-fatal shootings this year, including two Los Angeles sheriff’s deputies shot in Compton while sitting in their patrol car in mid-September, and two Louisville police officers shot in late September during a protest over the lack of serious charges against police officers in Breonna Taylor’s killing. James Scurlock, a Black Lives Matter protester with an infant daughter, was shot to death in Omaha in May after a confrontation with a white bar owner outside the man’s bar.
Other demonstrators died when cars drove through or rammed into crowds of Black Lives Matter protesters. Summer Taylor, a Black Lives Matter protester who worked in a veterinary clinic, was killed in such an incident in Seattle. So was Robert Forbes, a black protester from Bakersfield whose sister recalled him demonstrating decades earlier over the brutal police beating of Rodney King. In St Louis, Barry Perkins, a father of two, was killed after being dragged and run over by a FedEx truck during a protest in May. Killings amid political unrest In addition to the people killed while demonstrating, at least 14 more Americans have been killed in other incidents linked to political unrest this summer, including seven people shot during alleged looting of businesses, among them David Dorn, a retired police officer shot during the robbery of a pawn shop in St Louis; two California law enforcement officers murdered by an alleged anti-government “Boogaloo” extremist, one person found dead in a pawn shop in Minneapolis that had been set on fire; an eight-year-old shot to death in Atlanta; and a Louisville restaurant owner who was shot dead by the national guard. Some of those killings remain unsolved. One of two fatal shootings of young black men in Seattle’s self-declared “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone” was not politically motivated, according to ACLED’s review of details in the case, but the June shooting of Antonio Mays Jr, a 16-year-old, was found to be connected to the broader unrest. A Seattle Times review of footage linked to the chaotic scene of the shooting suggested that some people in the protest zone might have believed they were under attack when they fired their guns at the stolen Jeep Mays and another young teenager were driving into the zone.
Jessica Doty-Whitaker, a white woman, was shot to death early one July morning in Indianapolis. Her fiance told media outlets that her shooting had been preceded by a tense argument with some passerby about the use of a racial slur and the statements, “Black Lives Matter” v “All Lives Matter”. While they walked away from that confrontation, the fiance said, someone opened fire later and the 24-year-old mother was killed. Indianapolis police have not verified those claims or released any details about the circumstances of the shooting, and no one has been charged, but ACLED categorized the shooting as potentially politically motivated. Victor Cazares Jr was described by friends and family as a supporter of Black Lives Matter. On 1 June, a day of widespread protests across the country, he was shot to death outside a neighborhood grocery store in Cicero, Illinois, that he was reportedly trying to protect. While a Chicago resident was quickly charged in the shooting death of another man, Jose Gutierrez, that same day in Cicero, the Cicero police department did not respond to requests for comment about whether anyone had yet been charged in Cazares’s death. “He was just standing there making sure that everybody is OK,” Cazares’ sister told the Cicero Independiente. “He wasn’t there to cause any violence. He didn’t even have a weapon.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1403,Boris Johnson announces four-week national Covid lockdown in England,10/31/20,"A second national lockdown will be imposed across England on Thursday with all nonessential shops, restaurants, pubs and leisure facilities to close for at least four weeks, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister dramatically escalated the country’s response to the pandemic in a press conference on Saturday evening, telling the public that “we must act now to contain this autumn surge”, with measures due to remain in place until 2 December. People have been told to “stay at home” where possible, but will be allowed to leave their homes for education, medical appointments, to shop for essential goods, and to work if they cannot work from home. Outdoor exercise will also be permitted, with members of the same household or one person from another household. People will be allowed to leave home to care for vulnerable people, or to escape injury or harm. Takeaways and deliveries will continue to be allowed. The furlough scheme, covering 80% of the wages of workers who are temporarily laid off, will be extended throughout November, the prime minister said. Announcing the extension, Johnson apologised for the impact of coronavirus measures on businesses, saying: “I’m under no illusions about how difficult this will be for businesses which have already had to endure such hardship this year and I’m truly, truly sorry for that.” Under the new regulations, which will be published in full on Tuesday and voted on by MPs on Wednesday, households will be banned from mixing indoors, with the exception of for childcare and other forms of support. Support bubbles will remain in place, and children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated.
Unlike the first national lockdown introduced in March, schools, colleges and universities will remain open, as will childcare and early years care. “We cannot let this virus damage our children’s futures any more than it has already,” Johnson said. People who can work from home will be asked to do so, but those working in manufacturing and construction will be encouraged to continue going to work. Johnson also announced a ban on overnight stays and outbound international travel, unless the trips are for work, while places of worship will be open for private prayer but not for services. He also confirmed that the Premier League would continue. Despite the imposition of stricter new measures, shielding guidance will not be reinstated. However, Johnson said those who are over 60, or have health conditions that make them more vulnerable to the virus, should be especially careful and minimise their contact with others. He said it was vital to keep non-coronavirus healthcare operating, and insisted that people should continue to attend appointments and use NHS services. The prime minister said the government would seek to end the measures in early December, but said the exit strategy from the regulations would vary according to the severity of the virus transmission rates in different areas of England. He said he hoped the measures could enable families to reunite over Christmas. “Christmas is going to be different this year, perhaps very different. but it’s my sincere hope and belief that by taking tough action now we can allow families across the country to be together,” he said. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, described the restrictions as “a devastating blow” to business communities. Market confidence has been “hit hard by the unclear, stop-start approach” taken by governments across the UK during the pandemic, he said. He added: “Many firms are in a much weaker position now than at the start of the pandemic, making it far more challenging to survive extended closures or demand restrictions.” He called for government support for businesses facing hardship, whether through loss of demand or closure, to be boosted. He said: “The government must not squander the time afforded to them through another lockdown to enable mass testing and fix test and trace systems – which hold the key to a lasting exit strategy for both public health and the economy.” Mark Tanzer, chief executive of travel trade organisation Abta, said: “Today’s announcement that holidays in the UK and abroad will not be allowed under lockdown in England will mean a complete shutdown for travel businesses which have already been severely damaged by the pandemic – but public health must come first. “We’re pleased to see the government has recognised the significant impact the latest lockdown will have on businesses and has extended the furlough scheme until the start of December. “The government must also make good progress with the Global Travel Taskforce, ensuring a testing regime is ready to go as soon as lockdown is lifted. Anyone due to travel imminently on a package holiday should speak to their travel company to discuss their options.” Labour leader Keir Starmer said it was unfair to pretend to the public that Christmas “will be normal”. The Labour leader told reporters: “I don’t think Christmas will be normal and I think we need to level with the public on that. “This lockdown is going on to at least 2 December, everybody’s seen the figures, and, therefore, I don’t think it’s fair to pretend that Christmas is going to be normal in any sense of the word.” The prime minister’s announcement follows a sharp increase in the spread of coronavirus across England in recent weeks. The Office for National Statistics estimated that 568,100 people were infected with the virus in the week ending 23 October alone. According to modelling shared by the government’s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, without further action, the NHS would breach its fixed and surged bed capacity by the first week of December.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1404,Downing Street launches Covid lockdown leak inquiry,10/31/20,"An investigation has been launched in Whitehall after details of the government’s plans to introduce stricter national lockdown measures next week were leaked to newspapers. The Times reported on Friday night that the prime minister was considering imposing a national lockdown early next week. According to the report, Boris Johnson met with the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, and the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove to discuss the steep rise in infections, and was expected to hold a press conference on Monday.
Other newspapers, including the Daily Mail and the Sun, also wrote that a national lockdown was expected to be announced next week, which reportedly led Downing Street to launch a leak inquiry to uncover the source of the story.
The government has come under fire for failing to release the information directly to emergency services and businesses. John Apter, the chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, demanded “clear communication” from the government on coronavirus restrictions, saying a leak created a “media frenzy, causes confusion and … encourages some to make the most of their pre-lockdown time”.
Dr Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that briefing newspapers before businesses forced the latter to “wait and worry”. “If the government is planning another national lockdown it must say so immediately, rather than allow business and market confidence to be further eroded by speculation,” Marshall said. “The media briefings have to stop. The government needs to speak honestly with the nation, setting out a clear plan, the evidence for its actions, and significant increases in the support available for businesses and employees facing the hardship of no demand or the crushing blow of closure.” This is not the first time the government has been criticised for releasing information to national newspapers before affected communities. Earlier this month, the Sheffield city region mayor, Dan Jarvis, said “frustrations had bubbled over” among northern mayors when they found out about lockdown measures in their areas through newspaper reports. In September, the Speaker of the House of Commons accused Hancock of “running this chamber ragged” by deciding to brief the media about changes in restrictions before informing parliament. “I accept that decisions have been taken in a fast-moving situation, but timings for statements are known to ministers,” Sir Lindsay Hoyle told MPs.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1405,"Drive less or face post-lockdown gridlock, UK transport experts warn",10/31/20,"Many Britons will have to get used to driving less if the country is to avoid gridlock on the roads once coronavirus restrictions ease, and councils must provide better routes for cycling and walking, transport experts say. Government statistics show motor traffic is almost back at pre-lockdown levels, and only 59% of employees have returned to their workplaces. One study predicts that with health concerns reducing the use of public transport, up to 2.7 million more people could end up using cars for commuting trips alone. Cycling UK, the campaign group that commissioned the findings from a series of road transport experts, is urging the government and local authorities to push ahead with schemes to boost walking and cycling as alternatives. In May the government announced £250m in emergency funding for councils to implement schemes to boost active travel, including wider pavements, coned-off cycle lanes and so-called low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), where some residential streets are blocked to through motor traffic. However, some such schemes have been abandoned after angering some locals and politicians. A pop-up cycle lane in Reigate, Surrey, was removed within days following pressure from the local Tory MP, Crispin Blunt. In London several schemes have been abandoned or rolled back, including a bike lane on the busy Euston Road and an LTN in Lewisham. Rachel Aldred, a professor of transport at Westminster University, who was one of the experts consulted by Cycling UK, said non-car transport methods should be encouraged. “Without such changes, motor traffic will only grow further as and when [restrictions] are relaxed,” she said. “[Doing] nothing means more traffic jams, more road injuries, and more pollution.” Another of the experts, Richard Allsop, emeritus professor of transport studies at University College London, said people who usually drove would face some difficult choices on whether to endure – and contribute to – gridlock, or seek alternatives. “All users of motor vehicles have to find by trial and error how best to make their journeys, and perhaps which to give up making in their vehicles, as they collectively get used to the enhanced – but from their point of view reduced – network,” he said. “This will be a bit uncomfortable for quite a lot of us and really awkward for some. But our share in this discomfort is just our tiny share of the vast price that needs to be faced up to to reduce emissions, decarbonise transport and do our country’s bit in keeping climate change manageable for future generations.” Duncan Dollimore, the head of campaigns at Cycling UK, said ministers had correctly warned of the looming problems on the roads and had acted with the £250m emergency fund. “Unfortunately, a vocal minority of people and MPs have taken exception to these schemes, blaming them as the sole cause of congestion.”",,Politics,Guardian,4
1406,Flower power: Covid restrictions fuel boom in plant and bulb sales,10/31/20,"As winter approaches, the pandemic continues and spending time outdoors seems less appealing, how can you still get your fix of nature? By bringing the outdoors inside, or at least that’s what soaring plant sales seem to suggest. Latest figures show there has been a huge increase in the number of people buying plants and bulbs during lockdown, and medicinal plants have proven particularly popular. Experts say people want to connect with nature and that customers are buying more bulbs so they can grow their own plants next spring as gardening grows in popularity. Sales at Gardening Express of plants including echinacea, gingko, sambucus and green tea have risen sharply, in the case of echinacea by almost 3,000% compared with last year. It has sold more than 20,000 echinacea plants in the last three months alone.
The online plant store Patch said its sales had increased by 500% during lockdown and the DIY chain Homebase said the number of fruit and vegetable plants purchased has risen by 45% compared with the same time last year. Guy Barter, the Royal Horticultural Society’s chief horticulturalist, said: “Grow-your-own edible plants have seen huge interest. Over 3.5 million people have taken up gardening for the first time and there have been shortages of seeds and plants.” He put the rise in interest down to people having more time on their hands, being indoors more and wanting to make the best of their garden. “Gardening is also a comfort in troubling times,” he said. Barter said indoor plants had been equally popular among those without gardens. “House plants have certainly taken off … They are bought by those who want the benefits of horticulture but don’t have a garden or are not comfortable visiting parks and having to practice social distancing.” The RHS also said there had been a 533% increase in the number of 18- to 24-year-olds visiting its website in the last five months. Barter said: “One other thing is the demand for allotments has gone through the roof, certainly here in the suburbs, it has gone from small waiting lists to long ones. That is an interesting puzzle for councils who have to provide to meet the demand for allotments.” Beth Griffiths, a garden buying assistant at Homebase, said the number of people buying spring bulbs had risen by 18% compared with last year. “This suggests that gardening novices, as well as green-fingered pros, are still busy in their gardens, planning ahead for an edible, fragrant and colourful spring,” she said.
Chris Bonnett from GardeningExpress said: “We’ve had a very busy year and are continuing to see sales increase despite the slight easing of restrictions. September this year was up 200% on the same time last year but interestingly the types of plants that are selling well have changed. “We’re seeing an increased demand for plants with medicinal properties and health benefits. It seems like customers are looking for natural ways to boost their immune system and remain healthy as lockdown restrictions continue.” Howard Griffiths, a professor of plant ecology at the University of Cambridge, said that during the lockdown people’s awareness of the natural world “increased as we took our limited walks during springtime and heard the birdsong. It was only natural, as soon as we could get back to garden centres to try and bring some of that verdant world into our homes.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1407,From no to go: how Johnson's position on an England lockdown shifted,10/31/20,"Boris Johnson has relented to pressure from the government’s scientific advisers to impose another full lockdown in England, following warnings that the virus could kill 85,000 people this winter and local measures were not sufficient. After describing the move as “the height of absurdity” that would “turn the lights out” just 10 days ago, the prime minister announced on Saturday that new restrictions – including the closure of pubs and restaurants, and a ban on most international travel – would come in on Thursday and remain in place until 2 December. Here is how he changed his tune. 16 September: The prime minister tells MPs that a second national lockdown would have “disastrous” financial consequences for the country and that the government would do “everything in our power to prevent it”. He sympathised with critics of the government concerned over infringements on civil liberties, but said: “We must defeat this disease.” 19 September: Following the introduction of the rule-of-six restrictions, Johnson said the UK was beginning to see the onset of an “inevitable” second wave and suggested the government would have to go further. 21 September: Ministers were advised by Sage to urgently introduce a two-week “circuit-breaker” lockdown to reduce the spread of coronavirus, since the UK faced a “very large epidemic with catastrophic consequences” on its current course. The seven-day average of daily cases stood at 4,964; there were 1,502 Covid patients in hospital and daily deaths stood at 28. 12 October: Johnson announced a three-tier system, dividing England in areas with medium (tier 1), high (tier 2) or very high (tier 3) coronavirus alert levels. He said that the social and economic trauma of a full lockdown “shuttering our lives and our society … would do such damage to our economy as to erode our long-term ability to fund the NHS and other crucial public services”. 13 October: After news breaks that the government chose not to follow advice from Sage, Keir Starmer calls for the government to “follow the science” and impose a circuit-breaker of between two and three weeks to prevent a “sleepwalk into … a bleak winter”. Daily cases were 16,228, there were 5,030 Covid patients in hospital, and 108 daily deaths. 14 October: The prime minister tells Starmer in the Commons that he sought to “avoid the misery of another national lockdown” and attacked what he described as opportunism from the opposition party. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, also declared that a second national lockdown could irreparably damage the economy. 16 October: During a press conference, Johnson said he “cannot rule anything out”, but expressed his desire to avoid a national lockdown because of “the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have”. 21 October: Johnson again attacks the idea of a second national lockdown, condemning it as “the height of absurdity” that would “turn the lights out”. He said it would cause “psychological and emotional damage”. 29 October: The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, argues once again that the government does not want to introduce a second national lockdown because of fears that it could be “immensely destructive” for the country. 30 October: Government scientists warn that a two-week circuit-breaker is not enough to contain the spread of the virus, saying a longer lockdown is required. However, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, declares that a national lockdown would be damaging to the economy and would create “uncertainty”. There were 21,915 daily cases, 10,918 patients in hospital, and 326 deaths.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1408,How plot linked  to Kremlin fooled UK peers into fake ‘murder’ probe,10/31/20,"It was a murder straight from the McMafia playbook, a killing that connected Moscow to London and high finance to a criminal underworld. In its aftermath, a group of Siberian miners launched a campaign to get justice for the murdered man – Evgeny Lazarevich, a coal mine manager who had apparently fallen foul of a magnate whose profits flowed into London via Cyprus. But all was not what it seemed. Hacked emails revealed that the campaign was in fact being orchestrated by people with close links to the Kremlin who had an ulterior motive: to trigger an investigation by the UK’s National Crime Agency into the London-based daughter and son-in-law of the mining magnate, Alexander Shchukin. Winning support for the investigation in Westminster was a key part of the plan. Now the son-in-law, Ildar Uzbekov, is demanding an apology from those who were sucked into the campaign, which he suspects has been waged on behalf of one of several Russian oligarchs vying for control of Shchukin’s prize asset – a highly profitable mine owned by his family trust in Cyprus. Uzbekov, whose wife, Elena, runs an art gallery in Mayfair, has chosen to go on the offensive after two men who knew Lazarevich and had no links to Shchukin or his family were last month charged with the murder. “I am writing to those parliamentarians and all those individuals who were associated with the campaign against me demanding an apology,” Uzbekov told the Observer. It is a gambit that could potentially embarrass Westminster. A report by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee published in July warned insufficient attention had been paid to Russian infiltration in British life.
“This campaign was orchestrated by people claiming to act in the interests of the Russian Federation,” Uzbekov said. “I am a British citizen and this was an attempt to destroy me and my family. It is only right that I seek justice.” Those involved in the campaign to target Westminster included Alexander Korobko, a journalist who wrote a favourable biography of Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Andrei Liakhov, awell-connected former Russian military officer. Stanislav Antipin, first secretary at the Russian embassy in London, was also on board in the campaign’s initial stage, suggesting it had backing at the highest levels of Russian officialdom. Centred around a film, Blood Coal Money, the campaign erroneously sought to implicate Shchukin in Lazarevich’s murder and made a series of unfounded money-laundering accusations against Uzbekov. But the film was pulled before it was screened after Uzbekov sued for libel. In a darkly ironic example of life imitating art, a putative guest list for the premiere reveals that organisers had intended to invite the star of McMafia, James Norton, and the author of the book on which the BBC crime drama is based, Misha Glenny. The Liberal Democrat peer Lord Razzall hosted a dinner in parliament at which a 31-page dossier reiterating the film’s central claims was distributed. And Tory peer Lord Bellingham wrote to the then security minister, Ben Wallace, raising concerns about alleged human rights abuses and money laundering after a talk from the campaign’s organisers. Using data protection legislation, Uzbekov applied for “subject access requests” against both Razzall and Bellingham to see what contact they may have had with the campaign, which his lawyers said was being waged maliciously “by certain persons of influence within the Russian Federation to damage his reputation and cause him serious harm”. Both peers said that they had never discussed Uzbekov and were interested only in securing justice for Lazarevich’s family and encouraging cooperation with Russian prosecutors. “It has now emerged that the person who was alleged to have been disappeared by my father-in-law was actually murdered in a parochial dispute between neighbouring gangs in Russia,” Uzbekov said. “Those who have launched and participated in the campaign ought to have known that. We deserve to have our name cleared and all investigations by parliamentarians – and other British institutions – should be called off immediately and an apology issued.” Since the campaign against him began, Uzbekov has had his British bank accounts closed and has had to travel with an extensive security detail. The coal mine at the centre of the black ops campaign is being sold. Razzall and Bellingham did not return requests for comment.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1409,"Hugs, sequins and rainbows as Taiwan enjoys victory over coronavirus",10/31/20,"At the entrance to Taipei’s Pride march on Saturday, Pearl Jain and Lance Xie held up a sign offering free hugs. Similar placards were waved above the pulsating crowd of 100,000 sweaty and bedazzled party goers along the parade route. Xie had recently returned from Melbourne, where 5 million people have just emerged from one of the toughest lockdowns in the world and everyone is trying not to touch each other. It was good to be home. Jain said: “It’s nice to have the chance to hug people here because everywhere else is in lockdown and that’s just so sad.”
People in Taiwan are still taking precautions – mandatory masks on public transport, digital registration for some events, isolation for people with symptoms – but Jain said life in Taipei had barely changed in 2020. “We’re doing really great, our government and people here are just trying to protect ourselves,” she said. Saturday was Taiwan’s 202nd consecutive day without a single locally transmitted case, and for the tens of thousands out celebrating the LGBTQ+ community, Covid feels like a distant memory. Taiwan, a self-governing democracy of 24 million dangerously close to mainland China, where the virus began, has essentially eliminated community transmission of Covid-19 after recording just 550 mostly imported cases and seven deaths. Amid a global downturn, Taiwan’s GDP is predicted to grow by more than 1.5% this year. In the third quarter it grew by 3.3% – the fastest since 2018. The only other government claiming growth is China, which considers Taiwan to be a breakaway province that it must take back – by force or otherwise.
“In Taiwan, even though people are quite divided on political issues, when we face a common threat, people want to come together and work together,” Yawen Cheng, professor of health policy at the National Taiwan University, told the Observer. After the 2004 Sars epidemic killed 73 of its people, Taiwan strengthened and centralised its disease control framework and pandemic preparations, and started annual drills. Taiwan also learned from that epidemic that it couldn’t rely on bodies like the World Health Organization (WHO) for timely information, because China had ensured the country’s exclusion from global briefings and emergency meetings. “We couldn’t get direct information from international organisations,” said Cheng. “Taiwan has always been careful about what happens in mainland China, so the Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) of Taiwan tried to get information from informal channels.” When Taiwan’s authorities received a social media message in late December warning of a strange pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, they acted almost immediately, screening flights from the Chinese city before enacting entry bans, which were eventually extended to all foreigners by March. Strict border controls are still in place, and around 340,000 people have gone through the mandated quarantine for new arrivals, monitored by the CECC and police, and tracked by mobile phones. The government also banned mask exports while it stockpiled and then rationed them out to residents as local production increased tenfold. The health system was scaled up and new technologies developed to monitor, track and trace potential cases, and to support people with grocery deliveries and counselling. Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s digital minister, said the most important technologies in the Covid response were masks and soap, but technology played an “assistive role”. This included the development of a mask availability map using pharmacy supply and sales data, and “digital fencing” – using phone tracking to allow people to quarantine at home. When a signal leaves the property or drops out, a call is made to the police.
The measures “piggyback” on existing technology – such as mobile phone mast triangulation and SMS warning systems for earthquakes – to alert people to infection risks nearby, said Tang, a former civic hacker and well-known advocate of open democracy. They don’t collect any data they weren’t collecting pre-pandemic, Tang added. Other countries have balked at proposals far less intrusive than those that Taiwanese people accept. Cheng said there had been a lot of discussion about whether the state had gone too far but acknowledged that it had been responsive to concerns. In a policy study published in October, Cheng and her co-author suggested the Taiwanese government’s landslide election win in January gave it the political capital to maximise its response, and perhaps even to overreact. “I think social trust is the key to the success of Taiwan’s virus control,” she said. “It’s an interactive process. The government has done a lot to make the information more public and open, and so in turn the public trust the government’s actions.” Taiwanese society was not unchanged by the pandemic. While Taiwan’s tech exports rose in a world full of people stuck at home with their devices, the local economy suffered. The Taiwanese government has passed financial measures worth billions of pounds. Tang said habits formed in the early months, like contactless payments and online food deliveries, boosted e-commerce but hurt sectors that rely on face-to-face interaction. In response, the government launched a programme selling NT$3,000 (£80) shopping vouchers for $1,000. “That rebuilt the habits of spending outside of one’s home, and rebuilt the economy based on face-to-face transactions, like night markets,” Tang said. Now, Taipei’s shops and markets are heaving. People browse, busk and greet each other with handshakes and hugs. It feels normal.
Tang said the government’s willingness to listen to expertise outside its inner circle was key. It helped that the vice president at the time of the outbreak was Chen Chien-jen, an epidemiologist, but there was also “a larger culture that says we trust the wisdom at the edges and the frontline”. Back at the parade, the afternoon sun bounced off the blue sequins of Diva Wei’s ballgown as she and Daniel Lin waited to start marching, something they were conscious was open to few others around the world. “I feel this is the marvellous outcome of our government’s policy and the collaboration from society,” said Lin. “It’s so great.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1410,‘I became convinced I was channelling powers’: my life as a teenage witch,10/31/20,"I don’t trust anyone who didn’t have a teenage Wiccan phase. More than being gay, or British, or refusing to upgrade my iPhone, having been a teenage witch is a crucial part of my identity. I treat my dabblings in the craft like a competitive sport. Sure, you were into Charmed – but did you do your high school work experience as a fortune-teller? Did you ever travel to Croydon to attend Witchfest? Did you pay a membership fee to use a coven directory service, only to discover that none would accept ill-adjusted 14-year-olds? While some kids embraced the late-90s witchcraft boom by hoarding Buffy The Vampire Slayer box sets, or playing light as a feather, stiff as a board at sleepovers, I was not messing around. All it took was a single viewing of seminal teen horror film The Craft for me to realise that the lifestyle portrayed – being intimidatingly mysterious, wearing pleather, having supernatural dominion over others – was very much my vibe.
As an adult, I’ve realised that a teenage obsession with witchcraft is much more common among kids who grew up to be queer. It checks out. At that age, you already have a secret that you’re terrified might get you set alight – of course you identify with the maligned women of Salem. Plus witchcraft is inherently camp. Candles? Capes? Crystals? I shouldn’t have to join the dots. Factor in that witchcraft is an established gateway to boys wearing eyeliner and sure, I was interested. Other kids might have imagined life would be perfect if only their parents hadn’t divorced, or they’d made it into the football team, or could will themselves to go up a bra size. As a heroically camp child who was obsessed with Richard Madeley, I knew that any chance of leading a happy and fulfilled school life would require serious occult intervention. I wasn’t into football, or South Park, or casual racism. It was clear that I stood more chance of communing with the spirits of the four quarters than with my actual classmates. In lieu of a social life, weekends were spent hovering around the mind, body and spirit section of our nearest Waterstones, hoping that a passing witch might invite me to join her coven. (Unless you’ve actually visited Merry Hill shopping centre in Dudley, it’s impossible for me to impress upon you just how much that was Never Going To Happen.) My favourite book was Teen Witch by Silver Ravenwolf, largely because the cover illustration featured four girls and one boy, the precise gender ratio that teenage gay boys need to feel safe. Evenings were consumed by asking my tarot cards if I’d ever meet a Spice Girl or (this felt like a reach) have physical contact with another man. I spent a lot of time performing midnight rituals designed to make myself popular, and no time at all wondering whether the lingering scent of mugwort was stopping me getting invited to the cool parties. I wasn’t raised in religion, so had no prior experience of the altered states that can be achieved through ritual. This was a revelation. Surrounded by flickering candles, smoking incense and crudely drawn pentagrams, my senses would heighten as I cast a magic circle with my wand. Reciting incantations in a hushed voice, I’d feel the veil between our world and the next begin to shimmer. Nine times out of 10, this rapture would be interrupted by my sister storming into my room to reclaim her nag champa incense sticks. Still, I felt sure that my ascent to a higher frequency was simply a matter of time, dedication and copious amounts of sandalwood oil. When a money spell led to me finding £10 in the street, I became convinced I was channelling powers – dangerous ones – beyond my comprehension. I was delighted. By the time I was 15, I had to choose where to do my mandatory week of work experience. I was torn between Toni & Guy hairdressers (proximity to gay men meant that I might finally lose my virginity and/or emerge with a trendy mullet), or the nearest metaphysical supply store (I was pretty sure they’d teach me to levitate). In the end, I plumped for being bestowed unimaginable powers, but it was a close call.
In case you’re picturing Hogwarts, I should say that the scene of my mystical education was a cluttered shop next to a chippy in suburban Birmingham. I was already on first-name terms with the staff, who were used to answering my various questions (Is bergamot or coltsfoot better for protection spells? If I can’t afford a cauldron, is it OK to represent the goddess’s womb with a Simpsons mug? Why am I so lonely?). The owner, Jemima, was a huge advocate of urine, which she insisted could be used as a substitute for pretty much any medicine or cosmetic. On my second day, she pulled me to one side and suggested I get into the habit of washing my face in my own wee, which was apparently more potent than the animal urine she said was used in expensive face creams. When I expressed surprise that luxury brands were trafficking in pig piss, she assured me that they got away with it by labelling the ingredient as plant urine. After a moment spent watching me grapple with the ramifications, she assumed the smug expression of a prosecutor about to deliver their killer detail, and hissed: “But. Plants. Don’t. Urinate.” The next day I listened as Jemima regaled a customer with her conspiracy theory. When they remained unconverted to the notion that bathing in urine guaranteed eternal youthfulness, she lifted her fringe and demanded to know, “How old do I look to you?” I pretended not to hear when Shola, the shop assistant, muttered, “About 79.” Shola was a non-believer, and nurtured a long-running feud with one of the mediums after he implored her to listen to her child’s psychic pronouncements. At 18, she was livid that he thought she looked old enough to have a child capable of speaking, never mind to dead people. When a pair of schoolkids burst in and screamed, “Is this a hippy shop or something?”, she didn’t look up from her copy of Take A Break before responding, “Yes, now fuck off.” Fortunately for me, the owners were too busy contemplating their own auras to think that there might be a conflict of interest in asking me to price the assorted amethysts I’d later be buying. My other duties included cleaning the flotation tank, dusting the wands and studying Cunningham’s Encyclopedia Of Crystal, Gem & Metal Magic as if it were a GSCE set text (I hadn’t been explicitly asked to do this, but my work experience guidelines encouraged me to use my own initiative). I should have been on cloud nine, but by the end of the week I felt deflated. I hadn’t learned how to astrally project, or divine the future with runes, or even mastered working the till. At the very least I’d hoped I could leverage my week of retail experience into a Saturday job at Waitrose; but when I later had an interview for the fish counter, they seemed unimpressed by my extensive knowledge of crystal balls.
Perhaps the biggest disappointment was that I still hadn’t found my people. The witches I idolised were glamorous and enigmatic – like Maxine Sanders, the peroxide blond Witch Queen who ruled the sketchier parts of 1970s London. The pagans I met in real life didn’t look like people who had harnessed the unseen currents of the universe. A surprising number wore fleeces. I began to wonder whether people drawn to mystical realms really were charmed souls, or misfits who had struggled to find a place for themselves anywhere else. It was painful to consider that I might belong to the second category. As I entered my late teens, other things started to preoccupy me, like reordering my Myspace top eight and tending to an asymmetrical haircut that required straightening every four to six hours. By the time I left school for a different sixth form, I’d reinvented myself as someone who wore distressed denim and had never accidentally referred to their form teacher as “Mum”. There was no single moment when I disavowed my pagan past, but my esoteric pursuits began to take up less space. Sabbats would pass unmarked, and I discovered a gay club that charged £8 for entry and all-you-could-drink spirits and mixers. I imagine many of history’s most promising occultists fell by the wayside in a similar manner. While my interest in mysticism receded, it has never entirely left me. I still occasionally visit psychics, and maintain a crystal collection that could fairly be described as unnerving. As a teenager, I felt powerless in a world I couldn’t make sense of; sometimes I still do. But somewhere along the way, I lost my conviction that the solutions lay in a red candle, or a green knotted ribbon, or a five-pointed star. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss it. • Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

1411,Johnson to hold press conference as England Covid lockdown looms,10/31/20,"Coronavirus is “running riot” across all age groups, a government scientific adviser has said before an expected announcement by the prime minister that England will go into lockdown next week. Downing Street confirmed that Boris Johnson would hold a press conference late on Saturday afternoon, after scientists on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) told him Covid-19 was spreading significantly faster than their worst-case scenarios and could kill 85,000 people this winter.
The Times reported on Friday night that Johnson was expected to announce the measures for England, which could be introduced on Wednesday and last until 1 December. It is understood that an official inquiry has been launched after details of a meeting between senior members of the cabinet were leaked on Friday night. Everything except essential shops and education settings could be closed. Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were to spend the weekend trying to work out what restrictions could be imposed without causing major damage to the economy. The National Education Union has called for schools and colleges to close during any national lockdown, and the University and College Union has said all university teaching should move online if stricter measures are introduced. Speaking in a personal capacity on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Prof Calum Semple, a member of Sage, said the country was in a second wave of the virus. “Unlike the first wave, where we had a national lockdown which protected huge swathes of society, this outbreak is now running riot across all age groups,” he said. He said there were “many more cases, particularly in younger females between the ages of 20 and 40”, with three to four times as many women in that age group going to hospital as men, because they were being exposed to the virus in hospitality, retail and some educational settings.
Prof John Edmunds, a professor of epidemiology and population at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a Sage member, said the spread of coronavirus in England had been worse than the forecasted worst-case scenario “for some time”. Edmunds criticised the government’s current approach to the pandemic, saying that it “guarantees high incidence across the country over the winter”. “It is really unthinkable now, unfortunately, that we don’t count our deaths in tens of thousands from this wave,” he told the Today programme. “The issue is, is that going to be low tens of thousands if we take radical action now or is that going to be the high tens of thousands if we don’t?” Ministers previously rejected a two-week “circuit breaker” lockdown, as recommended by Sage and the Labour party. It is now thought something longer will be needed. Edmunds said the country needed to “put the brakes on harder and longer” to reduce infection rates, and that it would be beneficial to impose this even in areas with low transmission rates. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey found cases “continued to rise steeply” in the week ending 23 October, with an estimated 568,100 people in households becoming infected. Scientific advisers at the top of government believe it is now too late for a two-week lockdown to have enough of an effect, and a longer one is needed to drive the reproduction number, or R value, of the virus below one. The advisers believe all parts of England are on course to eventually end up in tier 3 restrictions, and deaths could potentially hit 500 a day within weeks. Government scientists are also confident that more than 50,000 new cases of coronavirus are now occurring every day in England. Official documents released by the government showed that a Sage meeting on 8 October said the number of infections and hospital admissions was “exceeding the reasonable worst case scenario planning levels at this time”. The meeting, held just days before three-tier restrictions were announced, said the number of deaths was also “highly likely to exceed reasonable worst case planning levels” within the next two weeks.
Prof Jeremy Farrar, an infectious diseases expert and Sage member, said on Friday that “we have to act now” to bring coronavirus under control. He tweeted: “The best time to act was a month ago but these are very tough decisions which we would all like to avoid. The second-best time is now.” Lucy Powell, the shadow business minister, told BBC Breakfast that the government’s “dithering” meant it had missed the opportunity to lockdown over half term and have the most impact. “It sounds like it is going to have to be longer than it would have had to have been because we are doing it too late.” France and Germany announced national lockdowns earlier this week, while in Northern Ireland pubs and restaurants were closed, except for takeaways and deliveries, for four weeks starting on 16 October. Schools were closed for two weeks. Wales is currently under a “firebreak” lockdown with leisure, hospitality and tourism businesses closed, and in Scotland the majority of people will be under level 3 of a new five-level system from Monday. Nicola Sturgeon has told people in Scotland not to travel to England. Speaking before Johnson’s press conference, the first minister said: “People should not travel to or from level 3 areas in Scotland and for now, we are asking people not to travel to or from England at all, except for essential purposes.” The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the country’s ministers would meet to discuss “any potential border issues for Wales in light of any announcement by No 10”. He reiterated that the firebreak lockdown in Wales, which came into force on 23 October, would end on 9 November regardless of what England did.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1412,New Zealand Greens accept Ardern's offer of 'cooperation agreement',10/31/20,"New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has agreed on a governing “cooperation agreement” with the Green party, offering two ministries and agreeing to a handful of shared policy priorities for her second term – an offer they accepted late on Saturday. Labour won the general election in October with an outright majority, meaning they could govern alone. But Ardern invited the Greens into a “cooperation” agreement, saying it would allow the government to benefit from the expertise of Green party members in areas such as the environment, climate change and child wellbeing.
In a move being applauded by supporters of the left, Green party co-leaders James Shaw and Marama Davidson will both hold ministerial portfolios outside of cabinet, making the most of their areas of experience, interest and expertise. Shaw will continue as climate change minister, as well as associate environment minister (biodiversity), while Davidson will be appointed to the new position of minister for the prevention of family and sexual violence, and will also take on the role of associate minister of housing (homelessness). Davidson is a survivor of sexual assault. In 2015 she was thrown out of parliament for revealing she was the victim of sexual violence as a child and has since become an activist for victims of abuse. A member of the Maori community, she is also an advocate for indigenous rights. “We showed in the last government we can work well with the Green party,” Ardern said. “On environmental and wellbeing issues there is much we agree on that is good for New Zealand and I want to draw on our shared goals and expertise to keep moving forward with that work.” Ardern was re-elected a fortnight ago in a resounding win, gaining a parliamentary majority in the 17 October poll. She has held talks with the Green party – a government partner during her first term - since the poll. “This cooperation agreement reflects the positive working relationship between our two parties and our areas of shared interest while respecting the mandate voters gave Labour to form a government,” Ardern said. “It will deliver stability and cooperation in key policy areas while allowing the Greens to take an independent position from the government on all other matters.”
The Labour leader’s offer has given the Greens the chance to continue their alliance for the next three years. “On election night I said that I wanted to govern for all New Zealanders and to reach as wide a consensus on key issues as possible,” Ardern said. “This agreement does that. “This arrangement allows us to have both the benefit of continuing with a strong mandate and delivering all those things that we campaigned on, while also using the skills and expertise that exists in the Green party.” More than 75% of the Green party’s 160 members voted to accept Labour’s offer on Saturday night, after a teleconference. Davidson said the party was “thrilled” with the agreement. “We entered into this negotiation hoping to achieve the best outcomes for New Zealand and our planet,” the co-leader said. “New Zealanders voted us in to be a productive partner to Labour to ensure we go further and faster on the issues that matter. We will make sure that happens this term. “In the areas of climate change, looking after our natural environment and addressing inequality, there’s no time to waste.” Coalitions are common in New Zealand, which in 1996 changed electoral systems to give minor parties a bigger role. This deal falls short of a formal coalition, with Labour calling it a “cooperation agreement”.
The parties have agreed to work together on climate change, environment, child wellbeing and “marginalised communities”. The deal does not bind the Greens from speaking out against government policies they disagree with. Ardern will announce her full second-term ministry on Monday, and meet for the first time as a cabinet on Friday after the confirmation of the final results from the electoral commission. • This article was amended on 2 November 2020 to better reflect Marama Davidson’s career and biographical details.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1413,NSW reports four new coronavirus cases as Victoria police arrest anti-mask protesters,10/31/20,"Victorian authorities have indicated that Melburnians could soon be returning to offices as the state recorded no new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday. However, there were four new coronavirus cases announced in New South Wales on Saturday, one of which was locally transmitted, with authorities warning a resurgence of community transmission â€œremains very realâ€�. Western Australia also recorded one new case of coronavirus, of a child in hotel quarantine who returned to Perth from overseas and is a close contact of a previously confirmed case. The new cases came as scores of police arrested 21 people at an anti-mask protest at central Melbourneâ€™s Treasury Gardens. To control the protesters, officers formed a ring around the gathering.
A Victoria police spokeswoman told Guardian Australia the arrests were made for a range of offences including not wearing a mask, breaching public gathering directions, and travelling more than 25km from their homes. Victoriaâ€™s health minister, Martin Foley, said â€œat the moment protests that spread the risk of the virus are not safe.â€� At Saturdayâ€™s Victorian Covid-19 press conference â€“ the first in more than 100 days not to be headed by the stateâ€™s premier, Daniel Andrews â€“ chief health officer Brett Sutton and Foley announced one â€œlow positiveâ€� case had been recorded. However, an expert review panel rejected this case by the early afternoon because the case had subsequently tested negative. â€œThatâ€™s a donut day,â€� Sutton tweeted to announce the reclassification of the case.
The zero-case day means there are now 70 active Covid-19 cases in Victoria, with the stateâ€™s rolling 14-day average of daily cases at about 2.4. However, the Victorian authorities are still urging anyone with symptoms in the Deer Park area to come forward for testing as they continue to investigate a Covid-19 case in the area that was announced on Friday. Health authorities continue to investigate two mystery cases in the state not linked to known clusters, in Heidelberg West and Wantirna, while also encouraging staff, students and their families who work at or attend Goodstart Early Learning in Bundoora to come forward for testing after a case was linked to the facility.
Speaking about workers potentially returning to offices before Christmas, Sutton said â€œif the numbers remain low then those risks become much less in the office space as wellâ€�. â€œClearly thereâ€™s an economic activity by virtue of return-to-work especially here in the CBD and that should be a consideration,â€� Sutton said, noting any return to offices would need to depend on Victoriaâ€™s Covid-19 case numbers. â€œSome can and should return,â€� he said of office workers. In NSW, the new locally transmitted case was linked to a previously known case, with both having attended the Flip Out Prestons Indoor Trampoline Park at Prestons in Sydney at the same time. These cases are both linked to a five-person cluster to have emerged from Hoxton Park. Saturdayâ€™s new case was a student at Cabramatta high school, which was closed for deep cleaning over the weekend. â€œNSW Health is calling on people to remain vigilant in the fight against Covid-19 and to continue to work together to minimise community transmission as the risk of a resurgence of cases remains very real,â€� a NSW spokesman said. â€œIt is critical people continue to come forward for testing when they experience even the mildest symptoms, such as a runny nose or scratchy throat, cough, or fever, which could signal a Covid-19 infection.â€� Also on Saturday, the Australian government announced it would spend $500m to buy and distribute Covid-19 vaccines across the Pacific. â€œThe Indo-Pacific region is the engine of the new global economy,â€� the Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said. â€œEnsuring it can recover quickly will stimulate economic activity and restore jobs at home and abroad.â€�
The purchases will be made from a range of manufacturers via the global COVAX Facility plan, which aims to ensure virus vaccines are shared with all nations. Australia will provide a range of support with the vaccine doses, including vaccine safety and effectiveness assessments, advice to each nationâ€™s regulatory authorities, technical support as well as passing along vital World Health Organisation information. The plan will be rolled out over three years to help countries such as Timor-Leste to achieve full virus immunisation coverage. â€œA fast, safe vaccine rollout in the Pacific and south-east Asia will mean we are able to return to more normal travel, tourism and trade with our key partners in the region,â€� Payne said.

1414,Rescue teams search rubble after earthquake rocks Turkish coast and Greek islands,10/31/20,"Rescue teams searched through concrete blocks and rubble on Saturday after at least 27 people were killed and hundreds injured when a powerful earthquake in the Aegean Sea toppled buildings in the Turkish city of İzmir and created sea surges on at least two Greek islands. Turkey’s disaster and emergency authority (Afad) said the quake on Friday, measuring about 7.0 in magnitude, struck at 2.51pm local time (11.51am GMT) with 407 aftershocks recorded overnight. Around 800 people were reported injured. Early on Saturday, onlookers cheered as rescuers lifted teenager Inci Okan out of the rubble of a devastated eight-floor apartment block. Friends and relatives waited outside the building for news of loved ones still trapped inside, including employees of a dentist’s surgery that was located on the ground floor. Two other women, aged 53 and 35, were rescued from another collapsed two-story building. Afad said at least 25 people were killed in Izmir, including an elderly woman who drowned. Two teenagers were killed on the Greek island of Samos after being struck by a collapsing wall. At least 19 people were injured, with two, including a 14-year-old, being airlifted to Athens and seven hospitalised on the island, health authorities said. Samos, which is home to 45,000 people, including around 7,000 refugees, mostly consists of low-rise buildings. The death toll is expected to rise, with the mayor of İzmir telling CNN Türk that at least 20 buildings had collapsed in the city. İzmir, Turkey’s third largest city, is home to 4.5 million people and serves as a gateway to several holiday resorts.
The earthquake originated about 11 miles (17km) off İzmir province and eight miles north of Samos, at a relatively shallow depth of about 10 miles. Afad put the magnitude at 6.6, lower than the US Geological Survey’s 7.0, while the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.9. The districts of Bornova and Bayraklı also suffered significant damage, the Turkish interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, tweeted.
Local people have been urged to stay away from coastal areas in case of a tidal wave or further tremors, Efthymios Lekkas, the head of Greece’s organisation for antiseismic planning, told Skai TV. Dramatic footage broadcast by Turkish television and shared on social media appeared to show flooding and sea water receding in the Turkish coastal city of Seferihisar and Greece’s Samos and Chios, which the mayor of Seferihisar described as a “small tsunami”.
Cars and household contents such as refrigerators, chairs and tables were swept through Seferihisar’s streets by fast-moving water. Mazlum Vesek, a reporter for the local newspaper Ege Telgraf in İzmir, said he had visited a hospital emergency room and counted scores of wounded people. Vesek said he was walking down the street when the quake struck and “the ground flipped under my feet like a rug”. He shared photographs and video of people screaming and trying to dig out survivors from one of the city’s wrecked blocks of flats. “There are no numbers for deaths and casualties yet but the hope of not having any is really low, looking at the buildings collapsed here in [the worst-hit neighbourhood] Manavkuyu,” he said earlier in the afternoon. “People are all out on the streets because they don’t want to go inside.” The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said “all of our state’s capabilities” had been dispatched to help those affected by the earthquake. Search and rescue operations had been initiated across İzmir province as night fell, with 38 ambulances, two ambulance helicopters and 35 medical rescue teams already at work in İzmir and more than 3,000 personnel and relief supplies sent from the rest of the country.
Local people used their bare hands and chainsaws to cut through the wreckage while shouting for onlookers to be quiet so they could hear people trapped inside. One woman was rescued alive from the rubble in footage broadcast by CNN Türk, while rescuers made mobile phone contact with a girl trapped under the debris. İzmir’s governor, Yavuz Selim Köşger, said overnight on Friday that more than 70 people had been rescued from partially destroyed buildings, with nine of 17 search and rescue sites cleared by early Saturday. Many people spent the night out in the streets, too frightened to return to their homes, even if they sustained no damage. Many slept in Afad tents and residents unable to go back to unsafe homes could seek shelter at local mosques, said Ali Erbaş, the head of Turkey’s religious authority. One İzmir hospital moved some of its patients – still strapped into their beds and hooked up to drips – on to the street as a precaution against aftershocks. Despite escalating tensions between the two Nato allies over hydrocarbon exploration in the eastern Mediterranean, Ankara said the foreign ministers of Turkey and Greece had spoken by phone and stood ready to help one another. The Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, also called Erdoğan to offer his condolences on Friday evening. “Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together,” Mitsotakis wrote on Twitter. Turkey, which sits on several active faultlines, is no stranger to deadly earthquakes. The most devastating in recent history was a 7.4-magnitude quake in the western Marmara region near Istanbul in 1999, which killed more than 17,000 people. In Greece, two people on the island of Kos were killed in a quake in July 2017. On Friday some shaking was felt in Istanbul about 300 miles (500km) away, as well as in Athens, the capital of Greece, although no damage was reported in either city. The earthquake was felt as far away as Bulgaria.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1415,The Leeds bakery that gave away 200 meals to families struggling to feed children,10/31/20,"Taking over a successful family business right before a pandemic would be enough to make anybody anxious. But Samantha Atkin is somehow unflappable. In Bramley, a suburb of Leeds, the 28-year-old runs Carol’s Confectioners, a bakery and sandwich shop that specialises in Jewish bread. It is one of the many cafes, pubs and restaurants that offered free meals to children during the half-term holidays. “We watched it on the news and there was just absolutely no way, in the position we’re in, to not make a sandwich for a child,” Atkin said. While not every business that made this offer has had a large take-up, Carol’s handed out about 200 lunches in five days. Atkin said: “That’s a credit to the girls in here, because they’re friendly faces in Bramley.” The staff in the cafe have connections at three local primary schools and have been extremely persistent in getting the message out. “That’s the only reason I can see that it’s worked,” Atkin added. Carol’s Confectioners is bright and cheery, with no room for seats inside. Instead, customers take their sandwiches, cakes and pastries to their cars or down the street to their workplaces. To the uninitiated, there appears to be no distinction between these regular customers and those collecting a free meal. The staff have the discretion of secret agents exchanging briefcases as they hand over pre-arranged free meals unobtrusively in plain sight. A woman appears in the doorway and, before she can open her mouth, Atkin recognises her: “One minute, lovey.” Nipping into the back of the shop, she brings out two prepared brown paper bags each containing sandwich, apple, soft drink, crisps and snacks, and hands them over with a smile. “There you go, chick.” “They’ve all got different circumstances and there have been some really sad stories,” Atkin said. One mother was collecting free meals for her children after struggling to buy food due to rent arrears. The young woman, who has two children aged five and seven, split from their father at the start of the year and does not have the support of family nearby.
She said: “It’s just really stressful. I’ve not been in this situation before and I don’t think people understand what it’s like. “There are some days, when, even if you put a gun to my head, I wouldn’t be able to find a tenner. I am still getting the hang of trying to budget. You can’t afford to make a single mistake. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.” The woman, who was told about Carol’s by another parent at school, described the free meals as a weight off her mind. “I can’t get over how kind people are,” she said. Bramley ward has the second-highest rates of child poverty in the city. Dozens of local residents and businesses have come into the cafe to donate money and, though she has not yet added it up, Atkin thinks donations might have exceeded the cost of making the meals.
If there is money left over, Atkin will wait to hear what the government plans to do over the Christmas holidays and anticipates offering the meals again. Otherwise, the cash will go to one of Bramley’s many community projects. Atkin is modest about her efforts, though it is clear she knows that Carol’s has made a difference. “Let’s just say I slept really well last night,” she said.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1416,U-turns: new England lockdown is latest in series,10/31/20,"The new lockdown in England is the latest in a string of U-turns performed by Boris Johnson’s government since the pandemic began. The prime minister and his team had been insisting right up until Friday that their system of three tiers was the best approach to tackling the second wave while avoiding the economic damage of a full circuit-break. Here are some of the other major U-turns performed by ministers during the pandemic. Extending business support Just last month the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, completely revamped his job support scheme, which replaces the furlough system. Sunak had earlier resisted calls to give greater support to businesses as the second wave and tier restrictions hit the economy. But he came up with more money after firms – especially those in hospitality – warned of big drops in revenue as a result of socialising restrictions and the risk of forced closure. Decision to lift Covid restrictions in Bolton and Trafford reversed Coronavirus restrictions banning people from different households from meeting indoors or in private gardens were due to be lifted in the two Greater Manchester boroughs at the start of September. But the decision was reversed by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who said there had been a “significant change” in infection rates in both areas. The statement was released by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) shortly after midday on 2 September, the point at which it said the restrictions had been due to be lifted. The U-turn came after council leaders in both boroughs had called for the ban on two households mixing to be maintained. U-turn on face coverings being worn in schools The Department for Education (DfE) reversed its policy in August, announcing that face coverings should be worn in corridors and communal areas by staff and students in year 7 and above in schools in areas with coronavirus restrictions. The new advice came after the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, had previously insisted measures being adopted by schools to limit the spread of the virus meant masks were not required and a day after a No 10 spokesman said there were no plans to review the guidance. A-level and GCSE results U-turn in England Following criticism from students and headteachers, and a backlash by Tory MPs, the government announced A-level and GCSE grades would be based on teachers’ assessments rather than a controversial algorithm devised by regulator Ofqual. The prime minister and Williamson had previously defended the “robust” system, which saw almost 40% of A-level grades reduced from teachers’ predictions. The announcement on 17 August, just days before GCSE results were due to come out, followed an earlier vow from Williamson that there would be “no U-turn, no change”. Government’s coronavirus contact-tracing app plans ditched A new NHSX app for contact tracing was announced by Hancock on 12 April when he said it would be “crucial” for preventing the transmission of coronavirus. The app was trialled on the Isle of Wight with a view to it being rolled out more widely across the country in May. However, on 18 June the government abandoned plans for its own app, instead switching to one using technology developed by Apple and Google. Trials of this one were launched in August on the Isle of Wight, in the London Borough of Newham and among NHS volunteer personnel and the app was finally rolled out nationwide in September. Primary school children to return In early May, Williamson set out the government’s ambition that all primary-age children in England would have at least four weeks in school before the summer. But on 9 June, he said there was “no choice” but to scrap those plans amid concerns that the two-metre social-distancing rule would make a full return impossible. In August, the government said its plans would be for all pupils, in all year groups, to return to school full-time from the beginning of the autumn term. Bereavement scheme for NHS staff extended After criticism that care workers, cleaners and porters were being excluded from a Home Office scheme granting families of foreign health workers indefinite leave to remain in the UK if their loved ones died of Covid-19, the government announced an extension of the scheme on 20 May. The scheme had been introduced in April but did not initially include all support staff in the NHS. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said the extension to a bereavement scheme for NHS support staff would be “effective immediately and retrospectively”. NHS surcharge for overseas health and care staff A day later, on 21 May, Johnson stood by the fee that overseas health workers were being charged to use the NHS. However, just hours later, following mounting pressure from senior Tories, it was announced that foreign health and care workers would be exempted from the scheme. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, called the U-turn a “victory for common decency”. School meals voucher scheme England footballer Marcus Rashford was credited with playing a key part in forcing the government to U-turn on its decision not to extend the children’s food voucher scheme into the summer holidays. On 16 June, cabinet minister Grant Shapps said free school meals were not normally extended to cover the summer period. Yet a few hours later, No 10 backtracked on its stance, confirming that it would in fact extend the programme. Speaking the next day, Hancock mistakenly praised “Daniel Rashford” for his campaigning efforts.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1417,UK coronavirus: Boris Johnson announces new lockdown in England from Thursday – live news,10/31/20,"This from the BBCâ€™s Nick Robinson:
And on this sombre note, I say goodnight and thanks for reading.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1418,Understanding how this catastrophe occurred is of critical importance,10/31/20,"Six weeks ago, the government was given a stark warning that the nation faced a “very large epidemic with catastrophic consequences”. Only by imposing an immediate two-week “circuit breaker” lockdown could it hope to reduce the spread of coronavirus, the Sage group of scientific advisers told ministers. “As over 90% of the population remain susceptible, not acting now to reduce cases will result in a very large epidemic with catastrophic consequences in terms of direct Covid-related deaths and the ability of the health service to meet needs,” the group warned. Assailed by Tory backbenchers and a right-wing media that abhorred the idea of restrictions that could cause economic harm, prime minister Boris Johnson chose to ignore that advice. As a result, Covid is now “running riot” across the nation, as one Sage member put it, with more than half a million people infected during the week ending 23 October. Deaths will inevitably rise in coming weeks: experts are predicting possibly thousands of daily fatalities by December. A medical disaster is unfolding. Understanding how this catastrophe occurred is of critical importance – for it cannot be allowed to happen again. Some may be tempted to conclude that our leaders took their eyes off the ball momentarily. It is not an argument that stands up to scrutiny, however. In fact, the causes of this month’s dramatic surge in Covid cases have their roots in policy decisions made by a government that has shown itself obsessed with libertarian issues since the start of the pandemic. This obsession led it to consistently play down Covid’s threat to our health while constantly highlighting its potential to cause economic harm.
In summer, for example, ministers chose to reduce lockdown measures despite being told by many scientists that with thousands of new cases still being recorded every day, it was simply too early to ease restrictions. The virus should have been suppressed for longer, in short. As a result, the nation’s newly developed test-and-trace system – which was supposed to pinpoint infected individuals and ensure their isolation – faced a struggle from the beginning to deal with high numbers of infections. This problem was compounded by the sad fact that the system was too centralised in structure and in the end shown to be unfit for purpose. That was bad enough. However, the problem was only heightened by the fact that the test-and-trace system had been presented by the government as a magic bullet that would get the nation out of lock down by quickly isolating infected individuals. This idea had one glaring flaw: large numbers of infected people displayed no symptoms of the disease and so passed undetected through the test system, which led to an inevitable rise in numbers of cases. Then, in August, the chancellor Rishi Sunak introduced his £500m eat out to help out scheme, to encourage people to dine out by offering discounts. Its aim was to reboot the hospitality industry, but it produced only marginal benefits. Instead, the scheme triggered a significant rise in Covid cases by encouraging large numbers of people to visit restaurants – where the virus can spread easily – over a concentrated period. Once again, safety came second to economic concerns. Since then, the government has attempted to quash the virus by introducing lockdowns at local levels and has persisted in arguing that a national circuit-breaker – as proposed by its scientific advisers – was not necessary. Now they are shown to have been disastrously mistaken.
It has hard to see any positives in this sad tale of government incompetence – though some lessons can be learned from the last lockdown. In particular, we must avoid the errors that led to infections spreading through care homes and must go to extreme lengths to protect the elderly and care workers. The test-and-trace service should be overhauled as a matter of urgency, and government advice to the public needs to be made much clearer and more consistent. As the head of the Wellcome Trust, Jeremy Farrar, has put it: “If we can steel ourselves now for a few weeks, there’s a chance we could ease up a little between Christmas and New Year without the virus getting out of control.” It is not much but sadly that is all we are left with at present.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1419,US sets world record for coronavirus cases in 24 hours,10/31/20,"The US has set a world record for coronavirus cases in 24 hours, according to one count, with more than 100,000 new infections recorded.
The daily caseload of 100,233 – as counted by Reuters – surpassed the 97,894 cases reported by India on a single day in September. The news came three days before the presidential election, and as Donald Trump continued to stage large-scale events at which Covid mitigation measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing are not enforced. The president himself, the first lady, senior aides and Republican leaders contracted the virus after attending such events. Trump, who spent time in hospital, has insisted the US is “rounding the corner” in the fight to contain the pandemic. This week his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr, a key campaign surrogate, said deaths from Covid-19 were “almost nothing”. According to Johns Hopkins University – which counted nearly 99,000 US cases on Friday – nearly 230,000 of more than 9m US cases of Covid-19 have resulted in death. The president and his campaign have sought to present a contrast to Democratic challenger Joe Biden’s promise to implement another lockdown if necessary. On Saturday, Biden said in a statement: “President Trump still has no plan to address Covid-19. He quit on you, on your family, on America. He just wants us to grow numb to the horrors of the death toll and the pain. We cannot afford another four years of his failed leadership.” On Friday, scientists at Stanford University released a study which said recent Trump rallies produced more than 30,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and “likely led to more than 700 deaths”. The authors set out to “investigate the effects of large group meetings on the spread of Covid-19 by studying the impact of 18 Trump campaign rallies” over “up to 10 post-rally weeks for each event”. “Our estimate of the average treatment effect across the 18 events,” they wrote, “implies that they increased subsequent confirmed cases of Covid-19 by more than 250 per 100,000 residents. “Extrapolating this figure to the entire sample, we conclude that these 18 rallies ultimately resulted in more than 30,000 incremental confirmed cases of Covid-19. Applying county-specific post-event death rates, we conclude that the rallies likely led to more than 700 deaths (not necessarily among attendees)”. The US has exceeded its previous single-day record, of 77,299 cases registered in July, five times in the past 10 days. The number of daily infections reported in the last two days suggests the country is reporting more than one new case every second. Despite the overall figure, the US has a rate of about 28,100 cases per million people, which places it about 14th in the world for prevalence. Many states experiencing surges in case numbers are re-instituting social restrictions. In New York on Saturday, Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters most people arriving in the state must now quarantine for at least three days before taking a coronavirus test. If that test comes back negative, the traveler can leave quarantine. The requirements will not apply to residents of “contiguous” states, Cuomo told reporters, and there will be different requirements for New Yorkers who leave the state for less than 24 hours. The governor named Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New Jersey as examples of contiguous states, home to many commuters to New York City. But it was unclear if neighbouring Vermont and Massachusetts would also be exempt. Cuomo’s office did not reply to questions seeking clarification on Saturday.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1420,What are the rules of the new national Covid lockdown in England?,10/31/20,"Boris Johnson has announced a four-week lockdown in England, following weeks of pressure from his own scientific advisers and opposition parties to introduce tougher measures to tackle coronavirus. The full details of the restrictions will be published on Tuesday before a vote in parliament, but this is what we know so far. When is England going into lockdown? The measures will come into effect on Thursday 5 November after MPs vote on them this coming week. While the lockdown will end on 2 December, it will be replaced with the current tier system and local restrictions will be introduced depending on an area’s infection rate. Can different households mix indoors? No, not unless they are part of an “exclusive” support bubble, which allows a single-person household to meet and socialise with another household. However, people are allowed to meet one other person outside for “recreation” as well as exercise, and parents are allowed to form a childcare bubble with another household for the purposes of informal childcare, where the child is 13 or under. What can I leave home for? People can only leave home for the following reasons: Education. To go to work unless it can be done from home. Outdoor exercise either with household members or with one person from another household. For all medical reasons and appointments. To escape injury or harm. To care for the vulnerable or volunteer. To shop for food and essentials. To see people in your support bubble. Children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated. However, people could face fixed penalty notices from police for leaving their home without one of the above excuses. Can I travel? Most outbound international travel will be banned. There is no exemption for staying away from home on holiday. This means people cannot travel internationally or within the UK, unless for work, education or other legally permitted exemptions. Overnight stays away from primary residences will not be allowed, except for specific exceptions including for work. Which businesses will close? Everything except essential shops and education settings, which include nurseries, schools and universities, will close. Entertainment venues will also have to close. Pubs and restaurants will have to close their doors once more. Takeaway and delivery services will still be allowed, while construction and manufacturing will stay open. Parents will still be able to access registered childcare and other childcare activities where reasonably necessary to enable parents to work. Public services, such as job centres, courts, and civil registration offices will remain open. There is no exemption for communal worship in places of worship (except funerals and individual prayer), for organised team sports, or for children’s activities. Elite sports will be allowed to continue behind closed doors as currently, including Premier League football matches.
Should some people be shielding? The prime minister said that the clinically vulnerable or those aged over 60 should be especially careful and minimise contacts, but there would be no return to the shielding programme used in the first lockdown. Johnson said those in this category should work from home. Will there be a return to the furlough scheme? The furlough scheme was set to end on Saturday and be replaced by a less generous package of support for employers and businesses. But that was before the announcement of a second lockdown. The PM said on Saturday that the old scheme – which pays 80% of salaries – would now be extended throughout November. No further details were given. Why has the decision been made? Confirmed cases are rising steeply, with an estimated 568,100 people in households infected in the week ending 23 October. Scientists on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) have warned that deaths could potentially hit 500 a day within weeks and that coronavirus could kill 85,000 people this winter. The group has been concerned that the number of infections and hospital admissions is “exceeding the reasonable worst-case scenario planning levels at this time” and they first called for a national lockdown on 21 September. “We’ve got to be humble in the face of nature,” said Johnson on Saturday. “The virus is spreading even faster than the reasonable worst-case scenario of our scientific advisers. “Unless we act, we could see deaths in this country running at several thousand a day – a peak of mortality, alas, bigger than the one we saw in April.”
What difference could a lockdown make? A lockdown can stem the spread of the virus and thus reduce the reinfection rate. “The idea of a lockdown is to save lives primarily,” Prof John Edmunds, a member of Sage, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday. “I think the only real way that we have a relatively safe Christmas is to get the incidence right down.” Johnson warned that “Christmas is going to be different this year” but added that by taking action now, he hoped that families could be together. This article was amended on 1 November to correct when the lockdown for England is coming into effect.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1421,Yitzhak Rabin: ‘He never knew it was one of his people who shot him in the back’,10/31/20,"They wanted him to wear a bulletproof vest, but he wouldn’t hear of it. Afterwards, they wished they’d pushed him harder – they should have insisted – but he was the prime minister and his mind was made up. He refused to believe a fellow citizen might pose a mortal threat. And so a quarter of a century ago, on the night of 4 November 1995, Yitzhak Rabin stood before a vast and grateful crowd in Tel Aviv at a peace rally, protected by nothing more than a jacket, tie and white cotton shirt. The size of the rally had surprised him: he was a shy man, awkward with attention, and he had doubted that thousands of Israelis would come out to show support for him and his attempt to make peace with the Palestinians. He told aides he feared the city’s central plaza – not yet called Rabin Square – would be empty. Instead the place was brimming with more than 100,000 people, many of them young, and the atmosphere, they said, was glorious. Rabin gave a speech insisting Israelis were ready for peace, urging them to overcome their fears, let go of the past, and finally forge an accord with their neighbours. The emotional climax came when the veteran folk singer Miri Aloni performed her signature anthem, Shir LaShalom (A Song For Peace). Sandwiched between Rabin and the other politicians, the singer beckoned the prime minister to join in, putting a microphone to his mouth. Reluctantly, all but blushing, he mumbled along in his rumbling bass voice, reading the lyrics from a sheet someone had given him. He got through it, tucked the text into a pocket and left the stage, walking the few steps down to a waiting car. He had a parting message for the crowd, including the teenagers jumping into the fountains with their Peace Now banners: “Let’s not just sing about peace – let’s make peace.” They cheered for the man old enough to be their grandfather. But it wasn’t just his car that was waiting backstage. Yigal Amir, a 25-year-old Israeli Jew, fervent in his faith and his nationalism, stepped out of the shadows and calmly shot the prime minister twice in quick succession. An hour and a half later, Rabin would be pronounced dead. Within a few months, his government would go the same way, taking the prospect of a lasting peace between Palestinians and Israelis along with it. To this day, the killing of Yitzhak Rabin by a man determined to halt the Middle East peace process remains that rare thing: an act of political violence that wholly achieved its aim. Judged by the goal it set itself, it is surely the most successful assassination in history. But it is also a story centred on an extraordinary man who had made the journey from warrior to would-be peacemaker – a story of the family who loved him, the bodyguards and doctors who tried to save him, and the rivals who jostled to replace him. The intense, desperate and chaotic 90 minutes that followed the shooting both revealed a nation riven by a lethal divide and changed that nation for ever. Now those most closely involved, several speaking for the first time to a non-Israeli publication, are ready to give the most intimate account yet of what happened on the night two bullets altered the destiny of two nations. *** The road to Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination began in Oslo. It was there that two teams of negotiators, Palestinian and Israeli, met in secret, gradually forging the Oslo accords, sealed in September 1993 by a handshake on the White House lawn between Rabin and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. Rabin delivered the ceremony’s most memorable line: “We say to you today in a loud and a clear voice: enough of blood and tears. Enough.”
His words carried extra weight because of his own history. He was a soldier turned politician, a commander in the founding 1948 conflict Israelis call the War of Independence; the victorious chief of staff in the 1967 war Israelis saw as a miraculous deliverance from extinction at the hands of three neighbouring Arab states; and a serial defence minister famed as “Mr Security”. Rabin was no dove: in 1988, he had ordered Israeli troops to put down the first intifada by breaking the bones of stone-throwing Palestinian protesters. But as the uprising dragged on, his position slowly evolved: he came to see Palestinian resistance not as a military threat to be crushed, but as a political grievance requiring resolution. When the Oslo talks suggested broad agreement might be possible, he faced a choice: to keep fighting or find a different way. The latter option was available to him in part because of his hawkish credentials: Israelis saw him as a man they could trust with the nation’s defences. So when he declared it was time to agree an accommodation with the Palestinians – even if that meant giving up some of the territory Israel had won in 1967 and occupied since – Israelis were prepared to listen. But not all of them. The moment the ink was dry on the Oslo accords, the Israeli right, and especially the settlers of the occupied West Bank and Gaza, denounced them as treachery. That intensified as the Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad registered their own opposition to Oslo by detonating suicide bombs in Israel – blowing up buses and killing scores of civilians. Rabin was condemned for betraying his own people. At anti-government rallies, protesters carried placards showing a Photoshopped Rabin wearing Arafat’s distinctive keffiyeh, or in a Nazi uniform. Everywhere he was branded a traitor. Meanwhile, Israel’s internal security agency, the Shabak, was picking up talk in far-right circles that alarmed them. Ultra-nationalist rabbis were calling Rabin a rodef: a murderer who, under Jewish religious law, could be killed to prevent further acts of murder. And the temperature at the anti-Rabin rallies was rising.
The then leader of the opposition, Benjamin Netanyahu, was the star speaker at two now infamous demonstrations, where the crowd’s slogans included “Death to Rabin”. In July 1995, Netanyahu walked at the head of a mock funeral procession featuring a fake black coffin. Israel’s head of internal security asked Netanyahu to dial down the rhetoric, warning that the prime minister’s life was in danger. Netanyahu declined. Perhaps he, like Rabin, didn’t imagine an Israeli Jew would ever kill one of their own; any threat surely came from elsewhere. That is certainly how Rabin’s granddaughter, Noa, then 18, saw it. These days she is a successful screenwriter who last year tried and failed to be elected to parliament for a new pro-peace party. She speaks via Zoom from her Tel Aviv apartment, where the memory of her grandfather still makes her smile. She remembers phoning him, the way his “hello” would melt as he recognised her voice. At social gatherings, he would deflect attention from himself to her: they were “partners” in covering up his shyness. When I ask what she misses most about those days, she says, “Being little.” The family used to gather in the grandparents’ Tel Aviv apartment on a Friday evening, waiting for the prime minister to join them. After Oslo, he’d have to run the gauntlet of the weekly protests outside, the crowds shouting all the usual slogans; Rabin’s wife would greet him with the words, “OK, traitor, you finally got home.”
It was around then that Yigal Amir, an earnest law student, made up his mind to kill the prime minister. Later he would insist he was not swayed by extremist rabbis; he had reached his own decision that Rabin – through his willingness to cede territory and to allow the creation of a Palestinian Authority, with its own armed police force – was a rodef and therefore a legitimate target. He got a weapon easily enough. With his brother, Amir was working on the creation of an anti-Palestinian militia. Nor was access difficult; on at least three occasions before the rally, Amir attended public events where Rabin was present. He was waiting for the right moment: he didn’t want to shoot and miss. The fourth of November was a Saturday, the sabbath, and Amir spent it quietly at home with his brother and parents in Herzliya, just north of Tel Aviv. He went to synagogue in the morning, returning later for another round of prayers. He stayed longer to say vidui, the confession: the prayer a religious Jew recites when he feels death is close. According to Amihai Attali, a journalist who is one of the few people to have spoken at length to Amir – conducting hours of interviews by telephone – he had not decided in advance that this would be the day. Rather, the decision formed as the sabbath hours passed. In the evening, he changed into the casual clothes he calculated would make him look like a secular Israeli, one who would fit right in at a Tel Aviv peace rally. He checked his gun, a Beretta 84F semi-automatic pistol, and his ammunition: a mix of regular and hollow-point bullets, the latter designed to expand on impact. He did not want to wound; he intended to kill. *** At that moment, Rabin and his team were preparing for the rally. Some of his advisers had been lukewarm about the idea: his former chief of staff, Shimon Sheves, didn’t like the optics of Mr Security surrounded by “lefty” peaceniks. Sheves lost that battle, but prevailed on the choice of official slogan: Yes to Peace, No to Violence. The threat Sheves had in mind was not chiefly Hamas bus bombs, but internecine enmity and hatred, pitting Israeli against Israeli. That informed Rabin’s speech, which addressed the rising extremism within Israel. In the crowd were Noa and her older brother, Jonathan. When the prime minister said Israelis had to pursue peace for the sake of their children and grandchildren, the pair smiled at each other: “It was as if he was talking to us.” Amir had arrived from Herzliya on the 264 bus, soon finding the backstage area where Rabin’s security detail was waiting. He was challenged at least twice: the first time, he leaned on a performer’s van and said he was a driver, even sharing a joke with a guard mocking the male singer on stage who was wearing makeup. No one saw Amir – a fellow Israeli Jew – as a threat, let alone an assassin; he looked and sounded like them. By now Rabin had finished his reluctant performance of the Song For Peace and come down the stairs. A reporter shouted: “Mr Prime Minister, is this the first shot of the election campaign?” Rabin didn’t answer. As he was getting into his car, Amir approached. At 9.45pm, he fired two shots: one hit Rabin in the lower back, rupturing his spleen and puncturing his left lung; the other tore through his rib cage, piercing his right lung. A third bullet wounded a bodyguard. Instantly, one of Rabin’s four personal protection agents, still known only as Agent A, jumped on Amir. He grabbed the assassin by the neck and hit his gun-holding hand, the two falling backwards on to the ground. When he talks about it now, his voice is hesitant. The Shabak had to grant special clearance for this interview, and he switches the camera off on our video call. Today Agent A is a lawyer, his past life a secret shared only with his family and closest friends.
“It was like slow motion,” he says. “I remember these seconds like they were minutes.” A moment later, Agent A would make a reflexive decision not to shoot Amir but to keep him alive, so he could stand trial. And yet in those long seconds, it was a different thought that pulsed through him. “What I thought was, we failed.” Whether Rabin lived or died, a gunman had got close enough to fire two bullets into the prime minister. “We failed in our job. In my job. I failed. And I still carry that feeling with me. And, honestly, I can’t let go. Even after so many years.” The official inquiry found that he and his fellow agents followed procedure perfectly; they could not be faulted. But that’s not how it feels. “It was something that, in my worst dreams, I didn’t expect to happen,” he says now. “It’s a burden.” He was only 23 when it happened: he thought he was old then, but these days he understands he was “very young”. When our interview is over, unprompted, Agent A clicks on the camera so I can see his face. He doesn’t mind that I know what he looks like; it’s everyone else who must never know. Does he fear people would blame him for Rabin’s death? “At first even some of my colleagues did. They didn’t say it to my face, but they said if they’d been there instead of me, maybe it wouldn’t have happened.” The agent who had been shot managed to bundle Rabin into the car and ordered the driver, Menachem Damati, to take the prime minister to Ichilov hospital, just a few minutes away. But the driver was so shaken, he became confused. Rabin was in the back and talking: he said he didn’t think he’d been hurt too badly, before passing out. Swerving to avoid pedestrians, crashing through red lights, Damati eventually saw a police officer. He pulled over and told the man to jump in. The officer took control of the car’s megaphone, instructing other vehicles to get out of the way and navigating Damati to the hospital. Ten minutes had passed since the prime minister had been shot. Incredibly, no one at the hospital gate had been alerted. Damati had to stop and explain what had happened, before he and the police officer carried Rabin, bleeding profusely, into the trauma ward. Soon a medical team of more than a dozen filled an operating theatre – including specialist surgeons who had driven across Tel Aviv in a crazed scramble. The room was quiet as they cleared the air from Rabin’s chest cavity and massaged his heart back to life: a pulse returned for four or five minutes. One of Rabin’s aides promptly made arrangements to set up an office inside the hospital, ready for a revived PM to resume his duties. But it was a false hope. “He was dead on arrival,” says Professor Yosef Klausner, then head of surgery at Ichilov. He knew their resuscitation efforts were futile, yet the doctors kept going: “They didn’t want to stop.” Eventually Klausner had to call a halt and formally declare Rabin dead.
The doctor tells me all this from his desk in Tel Aviv. On the video call, you see a man who is controlled and precise, a medical professional at the top of his field. But talking about that night, he falters. He is back in the operating theatre, watching the prime minister’s life slip away. “People started to cry,” he says, pausing to collect himself before each sentence. “They sat on the floor, crying. Some of them loudly.” There is a long silence. “Nobody knew him personally,” he says. Instead, “It was as if they knew that this was going to affect their country, their life, their families. They were crying not only for the prime minister – they were crying for their fate.” Rabin’s family were waiting outside the operating theatre. The journey there had been frantic, all of them piling into a car, following the news on the radio. Noa recalls, “I kept saying, ‘Nothing happened to him. I can assure you, nothing happened to him.’ And I think the sixth or seventh time I said it, my mum, who’s very gentle and polite – I can hardly remember when she raised her voice to me – looked at me and said, ‘Shut up. We don’t know anything, and you don’t know anything. So just shut up.’” No one at the hospital had been expecting them. They had no ID and waited for 15 minutes before being ushered in. By now Jonathan was sobbing. “All of a sudden you were in a movie,” Noa recalls. “The number of people and press outside. It was a feeling that the whole country was looking at that hospital, at that moment.” She and her brother stood in a corridor. “There were two nurses passing by and one said to the other, ‘He’s not going to make it, but they’re not telling the family yet.’” She saw the army chief of staff arrive, along with officials from the Mossad and Shabak. “And you know that the moment is coming, and you don’t know how you’ll face it.” Klausner and a colleague came to tell the family that Rabin was dead. Noa remembers instinctively pulling out a cigarette, the first time she had done that in front of her parents. “All of a sudden the whole corridor was holding cigarettes and lighting up. We started laughing, that this is the legacy.” Rabin had been an incorrigible chain-smoker. The family were ushered into a room to say their last goodbye. Noa thought she saw her grandfather’s trademark half-smile and asked a doctor about it. He told her it might mean Rabin had not died in pain – that when you’re shot in the back it can feel like no more than a sharp slap. “You can see in the video of the assassination that he’s turning around,” Noa says now, as if “he thought it was someone saying hi. I found a lot of comfort in that. He never knew it was one of his people who shot him in the back.”
At 11.15pm, the prime minister’s spokesman announced the death to the crowd that had gathered outside the hospital. There were cries of, “No! No!” The journalist Attali, then a schoolboy, recalls hearing the news on a bus packed with his fellow religious students. One punched the air and said, “Yes!” He got a smack round the head from the rabbi for his disrespect. Two days later, Rabin was buried in Jerusalem. In attendance were kings and queens, presidents and prime ministers, including King Hussein of Jordan with whom Rabin had signed a peace treaty just a year earlier. (Arafat was asked to stay away, though he did visit the Rabin apartment during the shiva, the traditional week of mourning: in what was seen as a gesture of deep respect, he removed his keffiyeh.) Bill Clinton bade farewell to a man he had come to see as a father figure with the words, “Shalom, chaver”: goodbye, friend. The teenage Noa gave a eulogy she had written before dawn that morning, in which she spoke very simply of a granddaughter’s love: “The ground has slipped away from under our feet,” she said. “There was no question whatsoever who would eulogise my grandfather,” she says now. “It was clear it was me. I was the one who was writing all the family speeches from the day I could hold a pencil.” But to speak in front of such a big audience, after such a tragedy? The soldier’s granddaughter replies, “Let’s just say I was brought up on tragedies.” Rabin’s immediate successor was his decades-long rival, Shimon Peres. Sheves recalls going to see the new PM, urging him to call a snap election. The right was weak, shamed by its association with the incitement that had led to murder; the wave of public grief, embodied by the candlelit vigils of young people, would surely lead to a landslide victory and an immediate mandate to complete Rabin’s peacemaking work. But Peres said no. After years in Rabin’s shadow, he wanted to wait until the scheduled election the following summer rather than rely on a sympathy vote. “He wanted to be elected by himself. It was just his ego,” Sheves says.
As Sheves feared, Peres lost in May 1996. The winner was the man who had watched those crowds chanting “Death to Rabin”, the man accused of turning a blind eye to the incitement that led to murder: Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu remains prime minister today. For all but 20 months of the last 25 years, the right and centre-right have held power. At the last election, the once-dominant Israeli Labour party of Yitzhak Rabin garnered less than 6% of the vote, and just seven seats. For two and a half decades, Labour has struggled to find a leader who might offer what Rabin did – that almost unique combination of a willingness to compromise for peace, and the credibility and political skill to deliver it. A quarter of a century after that rally in Tel Aviv, the notion of making peace with the Palestinians is discussed only on the fringe left. Soon after Rabin’s death, they found in one of his pockets the lyric sheet for Shir LaShalom, the Song For Peace. The words read differently now, especially the line lamenting the impossibility of bringing a dead man back to life, for no amount of “bitter tears” can wake him. But the words were also hard to make out: the piece of paper carrying Rabin’s song for peace was stained thick with blood. • The Most Successful Assassination In History, presented by Jonathan Freedland, is on BBC Radio 4 at 8pm on 2 November and 11am on 4 November.",,Foreign,Guardian,4

1439,A whole lot of hurt': Fauci angers Trump White House with dark Covid outlook,11/1/20,"The US should prepare for “a whole lot of hurt” under the coronavirus pandemic, senior public health expert Anthony Fauci has said, predicting a winter of 100,000 or more cases a day and a rising death toll.
“We’re in for a whole lot of hurt,” Fauci told the Washington Post in a hard-hitting interview published on Saturday night, three days out from election day, immediately angering the Trump White House. “It’s not a good situation. All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.” More than 9.1m cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the US and more than 230,000 people have died. Daily case counts vary but agree that on Friday the US set a world record for cases in a single day, between 99,000 and 100,000, as numbers surge in several states, many of them electoral battlegrounds key to control of the White House. On Saturday, Johns Hopkins University reported more than 81,000 new cases. There were 862 deaths, down from more than 1,000 the day before. Donald Trump, recently recovered from the virus himself, continues to campaign for re-election, staging rallies at which mitigation strategies such as mask-wearing and social distancing are not observed and regularly claiming the US is “rounding the corner”. On Friday he made the baseless claim that doctors are rewarded financially if people die of Covid.
His challenger, Joe Biden, who leads most national and battleground state polls, is staging fewer events and observing Covid protocols. Trump has charged that Biden is “hiding” and regularly mocked his opponent for wearing a mask. On Sunday, campaign adviser Anita Dunn told CNN’s State of the Union that since March, “what Vice-President Biden has done is basically why he’s got in this race, he showed people what a responsible president does and how a responsible president acts.” Fauci told the Post that Biden was “taking it seriously from a public health perspective”. Trump, he said, was “looking at it from a different perspective … the economy and reopening the country.” Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, told the Post that Trump “always put the well-being of the American people first”, and added: “It’s unacceptable and breaking with all norms for Dr Fauci, a senior member of the president’s coronavirus taskforce and someone who has praised President Trump’s actions throughout this pandemic, to choose three days before an election to play politics.” In fact Fauci has often clashed with Trump, and recently complained about comments being used out of context in a campaign commercial.
Fauci, 79, has been director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, serving six presidents. He is immensely popular with the public and largely seen as safe from being fired. But the Post also reported that “at one point during the interview, Fauci said he needed to be careful with his words because he would be blocked from doing appearances in the future”. Deere said that “as a member of the Task Force, Dr Fauci has a duty to express concerns or push for a change in strategy, but he’s not done that, instead choosing to criticise the president in the media and make his political leanings known by praising the president’s opponent – exactly what the American people have come to expect from the Swamp.” Public records show Fauci is not registered as a Democrat or a Republican. “The Swamp” is Trump campaign speak for Washington, supposedly a den of “deep state” bureaucrats and intelligence officials dedicated to thwarting the president and feathering their own nests. Trump’s former campaign manager, Steve Bannon, a key propagator of the deep state theory now indicted for fraud, has said it is “for nut cases”. Speaking to the Post, Fauci was critical of a controversial outsider brought into the coronavirus taskforce by Trump. Scott Atlas, a Stanford neuroradiologist and Fox News contributor, favours ending public health restrictions and pursuing “herd immunity”.
“I have real problems with that guy,” Fauci said. “He’s a smart guy who’s talking about things that I believe he doesn’t have any real insight or knowledge or experience in. He keeps talking about things that when you dissect it out and parse it out, it doesn’t make any sense.”
On Saturday, Atlas promoted an interview with RT – a Kremlin-controlled TV channel which spreads disinformation. “Lockdowns, facts, frauds,” he tweeted. “If you can’t handle truth, use a mask to cover your eyes and ears.” On Sunday he apologised for the interview, saying he was unaware RT was “a registered foreign agent”. Fauci also said: “Right now, the public health aspect of the [White House] taskforce has diminished greatly … the last time I spoke to the president was not about any policy. It was when he was recovering in Walter Reed, he called me up.” Fauci said he called into meetings but largely avoided the White House because “of all the infections there”. After an event for supreme court nominee Amy Coney Barrett on 26 September, cases proliferated among the Trump family, senior aides and top Republicans. Last weekend, senior aides to Vice-President Mike Pence were infected. Fauci also addressed controversial remarks last weekend by White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who said the administration was not going to control the pandemic. “I tip my hat to him for admitting the strategy,” he said. “He is straightforward in telling you what’s on his mind. I commend him for that.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1440,Antarctica is Earth's one virus-free continent: science fights to keep it that way,11/1/20,"This week, 40 men and women will emerge from quarantine and board the Royal Research Ship James Clark Ross as it prepares to sail from Harwich in Essex to the South Atlantic. Their mission is straightforward. They will attempt to salvage scientific operations in Antarctica while also keeping it Covid-free. The continent is the only place on Earth that is still untouched by the pandemic – though keeping the virus at bay there has come at a cost. All major research projects in the Antarctic have been halted. As a result, no senior British scientist will have embarked on a mission to the continent this year for the first time in decades. Nor is Britain alone in interrupting research in a region viewed as vital for studying climate change and biodiversity loss. Most other nations that send scientists there are also putting their research on hold because of the pandemic. “The problem is that we simply do not have the logistical support to get scientists to the Antarctic while ensuring that we can keep them Covid-free,” said Jane Francis, director of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). “However, we are going to maintain all our data monitoring so there will be no gaps in our long-term collection of weather data, ice-sheet information and wildlife statistics. That is going to be a vitally important undertaking.” And it will be up to the men and women who will set sail from Harwich on 5 November to ensure that these minimum scientific operations are maintained in Antarctica and crucial data collection is carried out. In addition, equipment will be serviced and made ready for the re-starting of research missions next year or later. The James Clark Ross will be carrying technicians, divers, field guides and other service personnel so that they can collect data, maintain and run instruments and gather biological samples in the months ahead. Ensuring they arrive free of coronavirus has required extraordinary efforts by the BAS. “Our key principal is to stop Covid getting to Antarctica,” said the survey’s head of polar operations, John Eager. “To do that, we have picked only very fit and healthy staff who have no Covid risk factors. Then we have quarantined them for 14 days. And on top of that, we have made sure the ship will not enter any port en route so there is no further risk of picking up the virus. It will sail directly to our research stations around Antarctica.”
These efforts have been undertaken not because there is any symbolic importance in keeping Antarctica free of coronavirus, added Francis. “We are being very, very careful about keeping the continent virus-free simply because if anybody were to become really sick in Antarctica, it would be very difficult to treat them.”
It will take the James Clark Ross about eight weeks to reach the British Antarctic Survey’s main station at Rothera – via its other research centres at Signy Island in the South Orkneys, and at Bird Island and King Edward Point, both in South Georgia. Summer will be starting by then. Indeed, at Rothera, sea ice has already begun to melt as the weather warms. “Wildlife has started to return to the station, with elephant seals and Adélie penguins already making appearances,” Robert Taylor, a field guide based at Rothera, told the Observer last week. “Normally, scientists would be flying in now and we would be preparing to take them out on the projects they would have planned. But those have all been postponed. It has become very quiet here.” The decision to cut back on Antarctic operations is a blow for many areas of research, in particular climate science. The most dramatic changes inflicted by global heating are occurring at the poles. In Antarctica, warming waters are eating at many of the great ice shelves that extend from the land over the ocean and melting them, a development that threatens to trigger significant rises in sea levels round the planet in coming years. “We desperately need to carry out full research programmes in Antarctica,” said Francis. “It has so much to tell us, and hopefully we will be able to pick up where we left off in a year’s time and return with large numbers of scientists. Then we can resume all the projects that we have had to postpone. Obviously that cannot be guaranteed, and we may have to postpone things for another year. We will just have to wait and see what happens.” The James Clark Ross is scheduled to return to Britain in March, bringing home those who have spent the past 12 months on the continent. They will be coming back to a nation that has changed dramatically in that time, raising serious concerns for their future.
“Most of us left jobs to come to Antarctica – with the assumption that when we got back things would be fairly similar to when we left. It’s clear that this will not be the case,” said Taylor. “In one way, we have been fortunate because we are currently at no risk of Covid and can interact with one another in the pre-Covid fashion.” That will change when Rothera and other station staff get back to the UK, Taylor acknowledged. “Normally, going home would mean regaining every freedom we sacrificed to come south, but this time it means swapping the natural restrictions of Antarctica for the ‘new normal’: social distancing, masks, adjusting our travel and behaviour. For good measure, there will be the added challenge of trying to see friends and family again and, of course, of finding work.” Science on the edge The British Antarctic Survey has five main research centres on and around the continent. Rothera is the BAS’s main research station. It has a small airport and is situated on Adelaide Island, west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Staff include engineers, electricians, a dive officer, a chef and a doctor. Bird Island, South Georgia, is a centre for research into bird and seal biology. Lying off the north-west tip of South Georgia, it is considered to be one of the richest wildlife sites in the world. King Edward Point, also on South Georgia, is a marine research station that plays a key role in monitoring the South Atlantic’s fisheries. Signy Island, South Orkney, has a research station where studies of the Antarctic ecosystem are carried out. Gentoo, Adélie and chinstrap penguins breed there as do southern giant petrels, brown skuas and Antarctic tern. Halley research station is currently only occupied in summer. The rest of the year it is run remotely. It is a key centre for observing climate change. Measurements taken here led to the discovery in 1985 of a massive hole in the Earth’s ozone layer. There is also a major colony of emperor penguins near the base.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1441,"As Europe's governments lose control of Covid, revolt is in the air",11/1/20,"As the second wave of Covid-19 filled hospital wards across Europe last week, and countries inched reluctantly towards varying degrees of partial lockdown, television schedules were cleared to allow leaders to address weary nations. Announcing a 6pm curfew for the country’s restaurants and bars the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, called for national unity. “If we all respect these new rules during the month of November,” he said, “we will succeed in keeping the epidemiological curve under control. That way we will be able to ease the restrictions and move into the Christmas festivities with greater serenity.” Speaking from the Elysée, a sombre Emmanuel Macron decreed a new national lockdown, lasting until at least 1 December, and warned France the new wave of infections was likely to be “deadlier than the first”. In Belgium, where Covid is spreading faster than in any other European country, the new prime minister, Alexander De Croo, hoped “a team of 11 million Belgians” would pull together to follow tighter regulations. In tone and spirit, the messages echoed those delivered in March, when shock and fear led populations to rally round leaders and consent to restrictions unknown outside wartime. Eight months on, that kind of trust and goodwill is in short supply. Europe, once again, is the centre of the global pandemic, accounting for almost half the world’s infections last week. But as desperately needed financial support fails to materialise, and track and trace systems fail to cope with the surge, there is public exasperation and, in some cases, open rebellion. On Friday evening, protestors threw molotov cocktails at police in Florence, in the latest outbreak of social unrest following Conte’s new rules. Pino Esposito, a Neapolitan barber, is one of those who has lost faith in the orders coming from the top. In his home city, Esposito is leading a group of small businessmen in a campaign against the new restrictions. “We are protesting,” he says, “because all European governments, including ours, have found themselves unprepared for the second wave. Since March they were saying that, in October or November, the second wave would come and that it would be even more serious. “But no preparation has been put in place for our schools, the health system, jobs, or the providing of incentives. And the financial support we were promised is not there to access. But businesses must have it if they are to stay closed and staff need unemployment money immediately.” Across the continent, there is similar evidence of people facing dire economic hardship and psychological exhaustion. Earlier this month, a study from the World Health Organization reported widespread apathy and reduced motivation to follow public health guidance. The emotional toll of Covid-19 has been compounded by a growing scepticism in the capacity of governments to truly get on top of a crisis that is destroying people’s livelihoods as well as threatening their health. According to the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, the continent’s partial economic recovery in the summer and early autumn was “unequal, uncertain and incomplete”. As the second wave hits, she said in a recent interview, “it now risks being extinguished.”
From Milan to Manchester, and Marseille to Madrid, that prospect has sparked a wave of revolts. After the spring lockdown was eased, the subsequent patchwork of regulations and restrictions hit some workers, and regions far harder than others. The Spanish government’s decision to declare a six-month state of emergency has led to angry protests across the country and a bitter row with the conservative regional government of Madrid, which has accused it of overstepping its powers. The mayors of nine cities, including Barcelona, Lisbon, Prague and Milan, have by-passed their national governments to write directly to the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, demanding access to the €750bn (£676bn) EU recovery fund. In Germany, where a partial lockdown beginson Monday, thousands of workers and employers in the arts and hospitality industries marched in Berlin last week, demanding greater financial support. Freelancers across the continent have fallen through the cracks of state support for those unable to work.
In Italy, a tipping point appears to be disturbingly close. Angry demonstrations erupted in Naples just over a week ago, after a local curfew was imposed. The protests were followed by civil disorder in Milan and Turin, where luxury stores were looted. “I think this is only the beginning”, says the Italian journalist and author of Gomorrah, Roberto Saviano. “In the first lockdown, Italians were united in the idea that this was an wholly novel emergency; a situation that any government would find difficult to deal with. Now they feel deceived. “They’ve been told that things were going well, that we were winning. But their savings have been used up, they can see the problems with a testing system that isn’t working, and there is confusion and disagreement between the scientists. People have started to lose faith in the capacity of institutions to save them.”
A poll following last week’s mini-riots found that over three-quarters of Italians believe there will be more violence in the streets this winter. “There will be unrest across Europe too,” says Saviano. “It will happen in different ways and with different catalysts, but it will come because the centre isn’t holding any more. We are a world away from the mood in March when it was a case of ‘we must follow the rules and protect ourselves or we will perish.’ Now some people think, well, I’m going under anyway if I can’t survive economically.” The geographer Christophe Guilluy, whose books have charted the growing social divisions between provincial and metropolitan France, is similarly pessimistic about sustaining a mood of unity. Over the summer, local leaders in Marseille complained bitterly that a nighttime curfew and mask regulations had been imposed from Paris without due consultation. Macron’s move to a new lockdown, believes Guilluy, is already creating new divisions, as those with sufficient means insulate themselves from the worst of what is to come. On Thursday evening, huge traffic jams built up as Parisians attempted to flee the capital and head for second homes before a 9pm curfew. “The Parisians who have fled to their second homes,” he says “are running the risk of infecting inhabitants of provincial and rural areas. They have been very badly received. “Inequalities between classes and between regions have been exacerbated by the pandemic. The truth is, social and cultural tensions have rarely been so acute in France, but the political classes are attempting to mask them by appealing to a sense of republican unity.” Political rivalries and ambitions that pre-date the pandemic are also complicating the response to the second wave. In Belgium – where overwhelmed hospitals in Liège have asked Covid-positive medical staff to keep working – concerted action was stymied by high-profile disputes between politicians from the Flemish-speaking north and the Francophone south. The country has now locked down until mid-December. But the minister-president of Flanders, Jan Jambon, had previously claimed tough action was necessary only in Wallonia. By the time of his U-turn last week, 600,000 Belgians were believed to be spreading the virus. “From May through June and right up until recently, you have seen a growing polarisation of opinion in public debate,” says Dave Sinardet, a political scientist from Saint-Louis University in Brussels. “The virologists would push for tougher measures, but there was a growing lobby for keeping the economy more open. So in September, when the infection rate was rising sharply, there was still a reduced level of restrictions. There’s a lot of criticism of the people who were giving that advice.” The obvious failure of the country’s track and trace system is contributing to a sense of disillusionment with the management of the crisis. “There is frustration and a feeling that businesses such as cafes and restaurants did a lot, and the government didn’t do enough,” says Sinardet.
Boris Johnson will on Thursday add England to the list of European nations shutting down for a second time. According to Germany’s finance minister, Olaf Scholz: “November will be the month of truth”, in the battle against the second wave of Covid. But the indicators are that the struggle could go either way. The pace and intensity of the surge in infections has taken governments by surprise and left them looking unprepared. Public buy-in to a renewed lockdown, may need a step-change in the level of support and solidarity governments are prepared to offer. The financial cost will be enormous, but the price of inaction could be much higher. In a column for La Stampa last week, the philosopher and former mayor of Venice, Massimo Cacciari, wrote: “A social crisis has been added to the public health one… [the crisis] is creating differences in income and living conditions which are completely incompatible with what we mean by a ‘democracy’. Are we aware of this? Up to now, I don’t think so. But there isn’t a moment to lose.” The stakes were dramatically high before the first lockdown in March. They may be even higher now.

1442,"Bagpipes and techno blast at Warsaw pro-choice march, but menace lurks",11/1/20,"It was a surreal sight – and a terrible sound. On Friday evening, as tens of thousands of pro-choice protesters gathered in Warsaw for a massive demonstration against a near-total ban on abortion, military police in red berets formed a protective cordon around the Church of the Holy Cross on Krakowskie Przedmieście, an elegant thoroughfare leading from Warsaw’s Old Town to the city centre. Behind the military cordon stood far-right activists and supporters of Poland’s ruling rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS), responding to a call by PiS leader Jarosław Kaczyński to “defend Polish churches” from what government-controlled state television news describes as the “leftist fascism destroying Poland” after some churches were defaced during protests last weekend. As the pro-choice protesters filed past the church, government supporters chanting mournful incantations blasted the screams of a crying baby through giant megaphones at the entrance to the church. The sound was broadcast on a loop, the desperate screams repeated over and over as protesters marched stoically past.
Agata and Aleksandra, both doctors from Warsaw who declined to give their surnames for fear of repercussions, were among those marching past the church and doing their best to ignore the screams. Standing under a statue of the 16th-century astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, they described their intense anger at a system that does so little to support the parents of disabled children and yet appears intent on banning terminations even in instances where a foetus is diagnosed with a serious and irreversible birth defect. “The moment when a woman discovers that the baby is sick and will probably die just after birth, this is the worst moment of their life,” said Agata, a gynaecologist, who was carrying a placard reading, “Don’t make me torture my patients”. “Usually these are older women in their 30s, women who really want this child, and the news leaves them completely destroyed. Until now they had a choice about whether to wait, give birth, and watch the child die – but they will not have that choice any more. As a doctor I want to help them, but now if I help them I would be going against the law.”
But if the protests, which by Friday had entered their ninth day, have been characterised by anger at Poland’s political and clerical establishments, the rage felt by many marching through the streets manifested itself within a joyful, even carnival atmosphere. Accompanying the chants of “Fuck PiS!” and “This is war!” were thousands of humorous placards mocking Polish leaders and demanding the right to choose. Some protesters wore costumes and danced as techno music and 80s classics were blasted from speaker vans. Protesters brought drums, vuvuzelas, kitchen pots and pans – even bagpipes.
There was a sense of euphoria as the various columns of the protest converged in central Warsaw into a single demonstration of 100,000 people, defying coronavirus restrictions banning gatherings of more than five. As they chanted, the red lightning bolt symbol of the Polish Women’s Strike was projected on to the giant communist-era Palace of Science and Culture as police helicopters circled. Not even the nationalist football hooligans who attacked the crowd on several occasions were able to spoil the mood of the protesters. In one incident witnessed by the Observer on the central thoroughfare of Jerusalem Avenue, about a dozen men dressed in black appeared from a side street and attacked the rear of a column of protesters, appearing to beat up one man quite severely. They were confronted by protesters with what appeared to be some kind of pepper spray or tear gas, leaving several bystanders spluttering and gasping for air. The Polish police later confirmed that several such incidents had occurred; of the 37 people arrested on Friday, 35 were associated with nationalist circles. Police also confiscated an array of weapons, including batons and knives. Many observers blame Kaczyński, Poland’s de facto ruler, for encouraging the violence by calling on his supporters to defend churches even after far-right groups had announced their intention to create vigilante patrols to confront the protesters. Last weekend, a woman was treated in hospital after allegedly being thrown down the steps of the Holy Cross Church during clashes between pro-choice demonstrators and nationalist activists.
Much has been made in the pro-government media of the apparent “vulgarity” of the protests, with demostraters regularly chanting “Wypierdalaj”, or “Fuck off” and holding placards with messages such as “My pussy, my swamp”, and “Kaczyński [a bachelor] is fucking us because he hasn’t got anyone else”. But protesters argue that their language is a natural response to the contempt shown towards them by their government since it assumed office in 2015. “Our attitude has changed in recent years because we realised that when you are dealing with louts and bumpkins you have to adapt and use language that they actually understand”, said Alicja, an IT worker who was holding a sign reading, “I tried being nice, now I’m just fucking pissed off.” And several commentators have argued that the protesters’ anger goes far beyond the present government and the issue of abortion, extending to the indignities of living in what is still a patriarchal society and under a political and legal order that was shaped in the 1990s by a previous generation of socially conservative men from both sides of the country’s political divide. Last week, Tomasz Grodzki, the opposition speaker of the senate, in a clumsy attempt to express his support for the protests, declared: “It is women who ensure that our daily lives go harmoniously and smoothly in an almost unnoticeable way.” ‘These codgers seem to think that the [protesters’ chants of] ‘Fuck off’ only concern politicians from PiS,” wrote commentator Kaja Puto in response. “Women have taken to the streets to fight for their rights, not so that you can return to power … For the last 30 years, as you have repeated the same conservative rubbish, Polish women have changed.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1443,Belarus protesters use Telegram to keep up pressure on Lukashenko,11/1/20,"In a small Minsk apartment one evening last week, a group of people gathered to discuss plans for a Halloween party with a twist. There would be costumes, drinks and games, but the main event was a ceremonial funeral. The plan: to bury Alexander Lukashenko’s dictatorship. “Maybe we should bury a pumpkin with a moustache,” suggested one young woman. “What about a giant rat?” “Yes! Brilliant idea! Write it down in the chat. We’ll need to work out where to get the rat model from.” “And we’ll need spades to dig the grave. It would be cool if we have a proper grave. There’s a funeral parlour near me, maybe we can actually order a proper gravestone.”
The discussion went on in a similar vein for several hours. Those gathered were the most active members of a local group coordinating protest events in one small district of Minsk, using Telegram. The app has been a driving force of the protests against Lukashenko, since they began in August after he declared victory in a rigged election. The biggest channel has nearly 2 million followers, helping to direct the weekly Sunday protests and spreading news about new repressions. Since August, the protest has also become localised, and hundreds of smaller groups have appeared. Now there are Telegram channels for each city, each district, and in some cases even individual apartment blocks. They provide support for people who get detailed by police, a forum to swap ideas, and in many parts of Minsk, local protest events, lectures or concerts. The most famous of these courtyard protest venues is just north of the centre, where a mural has been painted of two DJs who achieved cult status before the election, when they were hired for a pro-Lukashenko gathering and played the perestroika-era track Changes, which has become the unofficial anthem of the Belarusian uprising. The square has been unofficially renamed Changes Square and attracts musicians who give concerts most weekends.
“I saw the atmosphere at Changes Square and thought it would be good to set something up for my own district,” said one of those present at the gathering last week. Others joined in, and now they form a small underground protest cell, one of thousands across Belarus. Three months ago, hardly any of the people gathered took any interest in politics. They felt Lukashenko’s neo-Soviet authoritarianism did not affect their lives much. But things have changed quickly in Belarus, with a broad swath of the population developing political consciousness in a remarkably short time. “At the first big protests there was a feeling of: ‘Wow, are we really allowed to do this?’ Then there was a feeling of total helplessness seeing that it was not working, and now we are doing all this organisation as a form of therapy,” said one man in his 30s, who is responsible for distributing opposition leaflets and newsletters to people’s apartments in the neighbourhood. He has recruited a network of volunteers in each apartment block, as an intercom code is required to reach the letterboxes. “None of the carrier pigeons know who the others are, and why should they? I also don’t know the identities of the people who are printing the materials. It’s better that way, if they pick me up and start breaking my fingers, then I won’t be able to give anyone else up,” said one young man. With thousands of people arrested in recent months, everyone here now takes precautions. When going to protest, they take rucksacks full of essentials in case they are arrested. Several say they wear two pairs of pants just in case – nobody wants to spend 15 days without a change of underwear. As the protest mood refuses to be quashed, Lukashenko’s regime ploughs on with its grim crackdown. This week, some restaurants that joined a strike called by the opposition on Monday have been closed down, ostensibly on health and safety grounds, while Lukashenko has ordered universities to expel striking students. The dean of one university resigned, apparently unwilling to do so. On Friday, Lukashenko said the regime would no longer “take prisoners” and would hunt down opponents even if they were hiding in private apartments. “If someone touches a serviceman, he should be left at minimum with no hands,” said Lukashenko, who has on occasion made suggestions he is ready for reform though his actions have suggested the opposite. The district protest planners said for security reasons, they only communicated through encrypted Telegram chats, using accounts that were not linked to their phone numbers and registered under pseudonyms. Most of those gathered do not know each other’s full names, and only one of them knows who the Telegram channel administrators are. Sometimes, the conspiratorial chatter last week could seem a little bit overdone. It was only a local Halloween party they were discussing, after all. But the caution turned out to be far from misplaced. In the days after the meeting, strange men arrived at the apartment of one of the channel’s administrators and rang the doorbell for 15 minutes. She did not open the door, and waited for them to leave. Later, after other group members had done a sweep of the area and given the all clear, a friend picked her up and brought her away. Shortly afterwards, her landlord received a call from the authorities that they had a warrant to search the apartment. The rest of the group are now worried for their safety. Some of the details in this article have been left vague to protect their identities. “I don’t know what charges I face or whether I can go back, I don’t know what to do at all,” the channel administrator whose flat was searched said, on a Telegram audio call from a safe location outside Belarus. “But I know one thing: I’m not giving up the fight.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1444,Britain is facing ‘perfect storm of awfulness’ warns welfare expert,11/1/20,"The country is on course for a “perfect storm of awfulness” that will see rising homelessness, hungry children and poor families unable to cope unless the government rethinks its support for the most vulnerable, its former homelessness adviser has warned. Dame Louise Casey, who led the government’s emergency programme to tackle rough sleeping earlier this year, warned that a series of economic pressures were now in danger of colliding. She said that while the campaign led by England and Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford had provided hope, and she urged ministers to act.
“What we are facing here is a perfect storm of awfulness,” she told the Observer. “Everyone has been affected by Covid, millions have seen their income drop and even those who can weather that, are thinking twice. Rashford has pulled everyone together on the key and compassionate issue of making sure kids don’t go hungry or their parents don’t have to go hungry to feed them. The spirit of the Thursday clapping to show our support to the NHS and care workers lives on in his kind, honest leadership. “The British public do really care. The rising levels of homelessness and [with] the reduction of universal credit on the horizon, it’s hard not to feel bleak about this winter. Rashford and those supporting his campaign give me hope. Now is not the time for political division and tribal loyalty – it’s the time to bring us all together again. The government needs to heed the mood of the country and take action now. Kids should not go hungry, people should not be on the streets and the elderly deserve only the best of care that we can give.” Her intervention came as the head of the CBI called for the government not to ditch the £1,000 increase in the basic universal credit allowance due to be axed in April. In a rare move, Carolyn Fairbairn said “having a strong safety net is going to be absolutely vital” in the months ahead.
“A period of impoverishment in our country is unthinkable,” she said. “I think the idea that the £1,000 supplement would run out in March is something that should really be rethought. It’s also about fairness. There are going to be some people who have been kept in work through variations of the job support scheme, and others who are not so lucky. The gap between those two positions should not be so great.” Fairbairn is also calling for a new National Commission for Economic Recovery, involving business, unions, government and civil society, to plan how to revive the economy in the aftermath of the virus. Official figures last week revealed that there had been an increase in 16- to 25-year-olds sleeping rough in London between July and September, from 250 last year to 368. The previous quarter saw a similar 48% increase. Pressure is still mounting on the government over child hunger. A coalition of more than 50 public health directors, healthcare professionals, charities and local government figures have signed a letter to chancellor Rishi Sunak in support of a key element of Rashford’s child poverty campaign. They demand a major expansion of the Healthy Start scheme, which gives young pregnant women and low-income families with young children free vitamins and food vouchers to purchase vegetables, fruit, pulses and milk. They want the scheme to be enhanced and offered to more people, an increase in the value of vouchers and a publicity campaign to ensure it reaches those in need. “We are ready to help in whatever way we can,” they write. “We know that the nutrition and health of mothers and young children will have profound and life-long consequences for children’s futures. A fair start in life should be a key tenet of the government’s ‘levelling up’ agenda. Now is the time to act.” A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: “We are wholly committed to supporting the lowest paid families, boosting welfare support by £9.3bn in response to the pandemic as well as introducing income protection schemes, mortgage holidays and additional support for renters and constantly keep these measures under review.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1445,Catholic church leader criticises Covid worship restrictions in England,11/1/20,"Faith leaders showed signs of dissent over new restrictions on religious worship announced by Boris Johnson, with the leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales saying he had “not yet seen any evidence” to justify the ban on services. An organisation of imams also called for mosques to be permitted to remain open, saying they had provided valuable support to communities in recent months. Under measures coming into effect on Thursday, acts of collective worship will be forbidden though individual private prayer is permitted. Funerals will still take place with a maximum of 30 attending, but weddings will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances. Religious leaders will be able to broadcast acts of worship from churches, mosques, synagogues and temples, and public services such as food banks may still be run from these premises. The ban on communal services is likely to have a disproportionate impact on faiths that have little tradition of individual private prayers, including Islam and Judaism.
Responding to the lockdown announcement, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Catholic archbishop of Westminster, said it was “a source of deep anguish” that the government was banning public communal worship. “Whilst we understand the many difficult decisions facing the government, we have not yet seen any evidence whatsoever that would make the banning of communal worship, with all its human costs, a productive part of combatting the virus. We ask the government to produce this evidence that justifies the cessation of acts of public worship.”
The government had “a profound responsibility to show why it has taken particular decisions,” he said, adding: “Not doing so risks eroding the unity we need as we enter a most difficult period for our country.” Qari Muhammad, chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, said the ban on communal prayer in places of worship was disheartening. The Muslim community was seeking “limited communal prayer in mosques which is effectively individuals praying in unison following social distancing measures,” he added. “The fundamental difference between mosques and some other places of worship is that mosques are first and foremost used for communal prayer.” Throughout the pandemic, mosques supported people in need and mobilised volunteers in their neighbourhoods, he said. “Much of this work is sustained by communal prayer. We believe the continued running of mosques with all the necessary precautions is vital for the wellbeing of all communities.” Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, tweeted: “This is harder than the first wave – let’s be calm, compassionate and courageous … And may God guide our leaders in these tough decisions.”
Faith communities will be anxious about religious festivals that fall in the next few weeks. Diwali, the festival of lights celebrated by Hindus, Sikhs and Jains, begins on 14 November and usually lasts five days. The eight-day Jewish festival of Hanukkah begins on 10 December, after the national lockdown is due to end. However, politicians and scientists are warning the measures may be extended after 2 December. Christmas carol and nativity services are also likely to be cancelled if the lockdown restrictions continue into December. Many cathedrals that rely on visitor income and Christmas events will be braced for further falls in revenue and job losses. During the first national lockdown earlier this year, faith leaders moved worship online, streaming services and other acts of collective worship, and hosting Zoom prayers.
More than 17,000 services and events at Church of England churches have been posted online, according to a report published in October. The C of E has also been broadcasting and streaming national weekly services since the start of the pandemic. Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, said: “At a time when many have felt isolated and fearful, Church of England parishes and clergy have broadcast thousands of online church services and events, seeking to bring comfort and hope to their communities. “We know that tens of thousands of those tuning in will never have had contact with their local Church of England parish before and may never have heard the Christian message. Their welcome presence is a sign of the great hunger we all have for spiritual meaning in our lives.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1446,Chlorinated chicken vow won't put UK food standards fears to rest,11/1/20,"Chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef are off the menu for post-Brexit trade deals, though a government pledge not to allow such products into British supermarkets, restaurants or canteens falls short of demands for a legal ban. A more significant announcement by the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, and the secretary for environment, food and rural affairs, George Eustice, was the revelation that the government will table an amendment to the agriculture bill this week to put the newly established trade and agriculture commission (TAC) on a statutory footing. The move does not close the door on chlorinated chicken, which is emblematic of Brexit food fears, but it does add a layer of scrutiny to any trade deals, much-demanded by high-profile campaigners. It is also a significant U-turn by the government, which had recently rejected Lord Curry’s amendment to strengthen the role of the TAC despite a huge campaign by farmers, environmental NGOs and the food industry, all concerned about a future US assault on the British food sector. Sources say the change of heart came after a recent meeting between Boris Johnson and the formidable National Farmers’ Union president, Minette Batters, who recently said chlorinated chicken would become the norm if ministers were not given more power over trade deals. She hailed the move to strengthen the TAC as a “landmark moment”, but concerns remain over future food standards after Brexit because of the lack of transparency at government level. “These are all little baby steps at this stage. We have this language and pledges about chlorinated chicken, but we do not know what that actually means in trade policy terms,” said David Henig, the director of the UK Trade Policy Project. The central problem is the lack of a formal and detailed trade policy on what is typically the most contested area in free trade negotiations. Food and agriculture represent less than 10% of the British economy and exports will not feature high on the wishlist of trade negotiators, but access to the British food market will be the key driver for nations such as the US and Argentina, where grain and meat are central to their economies. “We can make the case against chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef by going around the world saying ‘this is how we should do this’, but this is not how negotiations work,” said Henig. “What we need is more than that. We need an actual trade policy. We still don’t have that. If it is going to be important to put animal welfare standards in our trade policy, then there has to be a debate about that in parliament, and we still haven’t had that. It’s not just that we don’t have legislation, we’re not at even at first base, which is having a trade policy.” There is also concern that the so-called Crag process, covered by the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act, is a woefully inadequate for international trade deals. Critics say three weeks is scarcely enough time to examine trade deals, which can run to thousands of pages laden with technical detail. The government’s food tsar, Henry Dimbleby, has called for a parliamentary scrutiny process more robust than Crag, arguing trade deals should be treated like legislation, with full parliament debates and select committee reviews. Batters made the point at the Tory party conference that ministers could make as many pledges as they liked, but could then turn to “secondary legislation on any day of the week effectively to change it”. Those with knowledge of the government’s change of heart, however, say putting the TAC on a statutory footing is “definitely a meaningful step”. They say that even before the Crag process begins, the TAC will get confidential privileged access to the trade deals before they are laid before parliament. This means if a trade deal does open the door to chlorinated chicken, for example, the independent body can raise a red flag and warn MPs before the start of the 21-day scrutiny process.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1447,Covid: how chilling projections prompted Johnson to lockdown,11/1/20,"Morgues in converted ice rinks, security guards outside overwhelmed hospitals to turn patients away, even municipal mass graves. When Boris Johnson’s “quad” of senior ministers met on Friday, they were presented with a chilling prognosis of what would happen if they failed to take draconian action. As they “walked down the path” of what would happen on current scientific projections, as one official put it, the opposition of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who had feared the devastating economic consequences of another lockdown, melted away. And the prime minister agreed with lockdown advocates Michael Gove and Matt Hancock that the government’s only acceptable course was to reinstate the “stay at home” order of March. Significant exceptions, including the government’s determination to keep schools open, mean this latest lockdown will be less draconian than in the spring.
But just as in March, Johnson and his colleagues will face the accusation that they have put many lives at risk by acting too late. The prime minister’s extreme discomfort will only be exacerbated by the fact that he was arguing so enthusiastically against a nationwide lockdown less than a fortnight ago – when he reassured the public his intention was not to “lock the whole place down from John o’ Groats to Lands’ End. Turn the lights out, shut up shop”. Meanwhile, Downing Street expended precious political capital in newly-gained seats across the north-west by fighting a bitter battle with the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, over financial support in tier 3 areas. That row was in effect rendered irrelevant on Saturday, when Sunak extended the furlough scheme – which pays 80% of wages – across the country for another month. Meanwhile, a No 10 operation that prides itself on slick communications, replacing leaky special advisers with hand-picked allies and banning gossipy lunches with Westminster hacks, faced the humiliation of seeing its plans emerge publicly – first late on Friday night in newspapers including the Times; and then on Saturday, as details were finalised, in a series of tweets from Robert Peston.
The comprehensive leaks infuriated Conservative MPs and led to an apologetic letter from Johnson to his own party, and Saturday’s hastily convened press conference, which was delayed by more than two and a half hours as the finishing touches were made. Downing Street insiders joked bleakly on Sunday that they had beaten Strictly Come Dancing in the Saturday night TV ratings, netting 4m more viewers than the family favourite, as the public tuned in to see the depressing details of what November would hold. Johnson’s allies argue that they couldn’t have won the argument about the need for a nationwide lockdown a month or so ago, when the government’s scientific advisers first recommended it. “At that point, do you take the public with you?,” said one. “Do you take parliament with you? Do you take the media with you? I think the answers to those questions is probably no, a month ago.” “There was huge scepticism,” said the aide, suggesting the public may not have abided by a lockdown at that time. “Ultimately, you govern by consensus,” they added. But many in Johnson’s own party were this weekend raging at what they see as the lack of grip shown by Downing Street – and the government’s failure to provide a clear route out of the crisis. The prime minister’s backbench critics fall into three groups. A hard core of libertarian Conservative MPs, such as Desmond Swayne, of New Forest West, regard draconian restrictions of the kind announced on Saturday as an authoritarian outrage – an infringement of personal freedom.
A much wider group have profound worries about the economic and social impact of the new rules, with many citing the concerns of desperate business-owners in their constituencies. And a third cohort say they will grudgingly support the lockdown in the face of the bleak epidemiological outlook; but are absolutely despairing about the government’s handling of the past few weeks – and the pandemic more broadly. One said their response to Johnson’s announcement was “not printable in a family newspaper”. Another that they could only support the new restrictions if the government pledges to fix the struggling test-and-trace system. Many fear the Tories’ reputation for hard-headed competence, already threatened by three years of Brexit chaos, has been obliterated by Johnson’s zig-zag approach to tackling the virus, from “stay at home,” to “eat out to help out” and back again. Labour’s support will ensure the new lockdown rules pass when they are voted on in the House of Commons on Wednesday, even if there is a significant rebellion on the government side. But Keir Starmer called for a “circuit breaker” lockdown three weeks ago, and he and his front bench will also continue to hammer home the message that Johnson’s “dithering” has cost lives and livelihoods – a message it may become increasingly hard to bat away by dismissing him jokily as “captain hindsight”.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1448,Covid: Johnson’s U-turn puts England under tough new lockdown,11/1/20,"Boris Johnson performed an extraordinary U-turn on Saturday as he unveiled new month-long national lockdown measures across England, amid accusations that government indecision and delay will cost lives and livelihoods across the country. With immediate warnings of the grave economic fallout and a mounting backlash among Tory MPs, the prime minister announced that a series of measures would come into force on Thursday to combat growing Covid infections. They will remain in place until 2 December. Under the new measures non-essential shops and venues, as well as pubs and restaurants, will be closed. Schools, colleges and universities will remain open. The public will be told only to leave home for specific reasons, such as work if they cannot work from home, to shop for food and essentials, exercise, medical appointments or caring for the vulnerable. The vulnerable and those over 60 are being advised to be especially careful and minimise their social contacts, but there will be no return of a formal request to shield themselves. Government insiders said the “time-limited” measures would then see a return to a regionalised approach. In another major reversal, the original furlough scheme under which the state paid 80% of workers’ wages will be extended for the duration of the new lockdown. Ministers had been resisting an extension of the scheme. The move angered regional leaders who had been pleading for extra support for weeks. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, said the Treasury had refused to extend furlough when Wales’ “firebreak” lockdown began. At a press conference, the prime minister said that he had decided to reimpose a national lockdown because “we could see deaths running at several thousand a day”. The virus, he said “is spreading even faster than the reasonable worst-case scenario of our scientific advisers”. He added: “The risk is that for the first time in our lives, the NHS will not be there for us and for our families.” His chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said the data painted “a very grim picture”. Deaths over the winter, he warned, could be “twice as bad or more than the first wave”. The government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) had called for a “short period of lockdown” five and a half weeks ago, but was rebuffed. At that stage, the UK was averaging 4,964 new cases per day, with 1,502 Covid patients in hospital and 28 deaths. Yesterday, there were 21,915 more cases across the UK, more than 10,000 Covid patients in hospital and 326 deaths. Johnson said he still believed a regional approach had been “the right thing to do”. However, he said the government had to be “humble in the face of nature”. He said that taking no further action would lead to the NHS being overwhelmed, with doctors and nurses being forced to choose “who would live and who would die”. “Christmas is going to be different this year, perhaps very different,” he said. “But it’s my sincere hope that by taking tough action now we can allow families across the country to be together.” He said while the lockdown was not as strict as in the spring, the “basic message is the same: stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.” The move comes less than two weeks after Johnson accused Labour of attempting to “turn the lights out” following Keir Starmer’s endorsement of a circuit-breaker lockdown timed to overlap with half term. It is also an admission that the three-tier system in England, designed to contain local outbreaks, has failed . Starmer said that the government’s delay in imposing a lockdown will come “at an economic cost and a human cost” and that the government had resisted scientific calls for it since September. He said it was unfair to pretend to the public that Christmas “will be normal”. “I don’t think Christmas will be normal and I think we need to level with the public on that,” he said. Johnson revealed the measures after presenting his cabinet with dire data warning that the NHS could surpass its fixed and surge bed capacity by the first week of December, even after elective procedures are cancelled. Ministers were told the growth in this virus is national, and quicker in areas with lower case rates. A Commons vote on the measures will be held on Wednesday. Tory MPs are demanding an urgent improvement of the test-and-trace system to ensure the “nightmare” of the new measures is not needed again. There is also private anger among the government’s scientific advisers, who say that concerns about exceeding the reasonable worst-case scenarios had been known about for weeks. Insiders expressed concerns about the government’s unwillingness to do anything seen as unpopular, adding that restrictions now had to be more severe and longer than would have been the case with earlier action. Ministers are already being warned a second national lockdown would hit the economy with the same force as the recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis. Industry experts said retailers and hospitality businesses, many already teetering on the brink, would join a growing queue of businesses filing for bankruptcy without further government support. The TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The extension of the furlough scheme is long overdue and necessary, but ministers must do more to protect jobs and prevent poverty.” Thousands of self-employed were said to be facing “financial calamity” without more support, according to the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said health service figures had been dismayed by the handling of the new lockdown plans. He said NHS trust leaders learning of the lockdown plans from newspaper reports had concluded the government’s actions were “not quick enough, decisive or clear”.
Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College London professor whose modelling still informs the government, said urgent research was taking place into whether schools and universities could continue to function as at present, given the role teenagers could be playing in the transmission of the virus. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said retailers were now facing a “nightmare before Christmas”, adding that there were “no circumstances” in which any retail premises should have to close in a second national lockdown. “It will cause untold damage to the high street in the run-up to Christmas, cost countless jobs, and permanently set back the recovery of the wider economy, with only a minimal effect on the transmission of the virus,” she said. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a senior figure on Sage who had pushed for additional measures, said that the lockdown was right and warned that the lockdown should probably be imposed for the next two months. “If we can steel ourselves now for a few weeks of greater restrictions, there’s a chance we could ease up a little between Christmas and new year without the virus getting out of control,” he said yesterday. Many scientists remained angry that the government has taken so long in heeding their advice. “Yet again, the UK has been slow to act and delayed decisive action until the last moment,” said Stephen Griffin, associate professor at Leeds University’s School of Medicine.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1449,Cubans lose access to vital dollar remittances after latest US sanctions,11/1/20,"Dayane Medina, a 30-year old mother, had been due to pick up the equivalent of $65 that her grandmother in Jacksonville, Florida, sent her this week. “I don’t like asking her for money – she is too generous,” she blushed, confessing that her grandmother sometimes sells food stamps to raise money. “But I’m not working at the moment and my husband is a doctor – we can’t get by on his [$62 a month] salary.” But Dayane, her husband and their two young children may be forced to find a way.
This week, Cuba announced the closure of more than 400 Western Union offices on the island, a move that will eliminate most remittances and aggravate the country’s profound economic crisis. The decision was a reaction to new US sanctions: in June the Trump administration blacklisted Fincimex, a military-controlled firm that processes remittances for Western Union. Last week, the treasury department banned US companies from dealing with Fincimex altogether. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said the US measure aimed to cut the Cuban military out of remittances so as to deny “the regime its misappropriated resources”. Sanctioning Fincimex effectively dared the Communist party to shift remittance processing from a military to civilian-controlled entity. But the Cuban foreign ministry issued a defiant statement saying the island’s financial set-up was a “sovereign decision”. Fincimex, it argued, has processed remittances for more than 20 years and during that period not “a single cent” had gone missing. These are “the cruellest and most inhumane measures yet taken by the Trump administration against the Cuban people”, said Ric Herrero, executive director of the Cuba Study Group, a Washington thinktank that advocates for engagement with Cuba. “Family remittances are a vital lifeline for millions of Cubans, especially the elderly and other vulnerable citizens.” Remittances, most from Cuban Americans, channel more than $3bn a year into Cuba’s ailing economy. Though data on Cuba’s foreign exchange flows is sparse, family remittances are probably the island’s third source of hard currency after tourism and the export of medical services. The measure will reduce revenue for Gaesa, an opaque military conglomerate whose role in the Cuban economy has grown over the last decade. But it will also leave the state with less hard currency to import food and medicine. Since Covid, Cubans have had to spend hours queueing to buy food like chicken. Many vital medicines, which Cuba provides at symbolic prices, are missing. The measure will also hit the island’s fledgling private sector. “Entrepreneurs use remittances to buy inputs and to invest, so many will have to suspend business,” said Emily Morris, an economist from University College London. “Lots of remittances are spent on services provided by other Cubans in both registered private businesses and informal activities. They are therefore an important source of income and employment.”
The crackdown on remittances was the last in a string of moves by the Trump administration to crush the island’s economy. It has sanctioned tankers carrying Venezuelan petroleum that dock on the island, a measure which has reduced food production by forcing farmers to till fields with oxen instead of tractors. US diplomats have threatened Latin American countries not to accept Cuban doctors and nurses during the pandemic. In recent months sanctions have prevented masks and ventilators from reaching the island. Analysts agree this onslaught of new sanctions is primarily an electoral gambit to win votes in Florida. Behind in the polls, Trump will probably have to carry the country’s largest swing state – home to 1.5 million Cuban Americans – if he is to win next week. Polls show that Trump is enjoying huge support among Cuban Americans. “Trump’s Cuba advisers believe that cutting off all hard currency inflows into the country will both precipitate regime change and help Trump’s electoral chances in south Florida,” said Herrero. “It’s completely asymmetric: they benefit from the rhetorical lift, and if they punish people on the island it doesn’t matter because they are still seen as tightening the screw.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1450,"England Covid lockdown could be extended beyond 2 December, says Gove",11/1/20,"The England-wide lockdown announced by Boris Johnson on Saturday could be extended beyond 2 December if the infection rate does not fall sufficiently, Michael Gove has said. When the prime minister announced the new measures in a Saturday night press conference, he said they would end on 2 December. But Gove told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme the measures would be reviewed at the end of the period and could last longer if they had not done enough to contain the spread of the virus. “We’ve got this four-week period, during which we’re going to review progress, but of course we’ll always be driven by the data,” Gove said. “We will always take a decision in the national interest, based on evidence.” Pressed on whether that meant the measures could be extended, he said “yes”.
The new lockdown marked a sharp reversal from Johnson’s repeated rejections of Labour’s calls for a “circuit-breaker” shutdown. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, claimed the government’s delay in implementing a lockdown had been economically and socially damaging. “An earlier lockdown would have been better for health, better for the NHS and better for the economy,” he told Marr. Starmer promised Labour would support the new measures when they were voted on by the House of Commons on Wednesday.
Johnson has in recent weeks faced protests from Tory backbenchers sceptical about the necessity for tougher restrictions. Gove’s admission that the lockdown may need to last longer was echoed by Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Farrar told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show that the 2 December review date was “useful”, but the government should not become fixed on it. “We don’t know what the situation is going to be like in the last week of November and the first week of December, we all hope that four weeks is going to be enough,” he said.
If infections, hospital admissions and other key metrics had not fallen sufficiently, he said, “it would be much better to extend this lockdown for another couple of weeks prior to the Christmas period and then loosen the restrictions a little bit over Christmas so that people can meet up with their families”. “Much better to do that than remove these restrictions and then have to impose even more draconian restrictions over Christmas or soon into the new year.” Farrar also questioned whether schools – in particular secondary schools, which some studies have suggested play a role in transmission – might need to be closed in future to make a shutdown more effective. But Gove stressed the government’s determination to ensure schools remain open – a view echoed by Starmer, whose circuit breaker call did not include closing schools. Farrar suggested the regional approach to managing the disease, which involved local deals painstakingly assembled with leaders in Greater Manchester, Liverpool and elsewhere, was likely to give way to nationwide rules.
However, Gove said ministers were keen to retain the ability to impose regional restrictions, to control regional outbreaks in future. “The regional approach is one that wherever possible we want to take,” he said. Challenged by Marr about whether the government had made a mistake in failing to implement a lockdown when advised to do so by its own scientific advisers in September – when Starmer was also calling for it – Gove said it was too soon to say. “I think it is impossible to know definitively until the end of this pandemic, which were the mistakes, and which were the missteps, which were most serious, and something that looks like a mistake at a certain point can actually in retrospect with more evidence have been proven to have been right,” he said.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1451,Frustrations and infections rise in Naples as second Covid lockdown looms,11/1/20,"The four women huddling around their neighbour in an alleyway off Via dei Tribunali, in central Naples, took turns to call an ambulance. “It’s an absolute disaster!” yelled one of them, called Antonietta. “Nobody is responding, we’ve been trying for hours.” The woman sitting on a chair in the middle of them, with her head bent forward, had a heart problem. Not even taxi drivers were answering the phone. One woman suggested calling the police. “Now do you understand why we’re so angry?” said Antonietta. “Things are so desperate here – Covid is not the only thing that is killing us.” Emotions are running high as coronavirus rapidly spreads through the southern Italian city and the prospect of another lockdown looms. Giuseppe Conte’s government is working towards new restrictions, expected to be decided on Monday, that could result in shutdowns in areas where the virus is escalating. But for many in Naples, where large numbers of people are employed on precarious contracts or off the books, the fear of poverty is greater than the fear of the virus. One of the most densely populated cities in Europe, Naples makes up the lion’s share of the infection tally in its surrounding Campania region, where daily cases have increased eightfold in less than a month to 3,669 on Saturday, the second highest in Italy after the badly hit Lombardy region in the north.
Thousands took to the streets as a curfew began last Friday after the regional president, Vincenzo De Luca, threatened a complete lockdown unless rules are observed. The protests, for the most part peaceful, have been gathering momentum since Monday, when bars and restaurants, a mainstay of the city’s economy, were forced to close at 6pm as part of nationwide measures. Cinemas, theatres and gyms have also been closed as the central government scrambles to regain control of the pandemic. As a result, Naples delicately balances on the precipice of not just a health but an economic disaster, something that can be seen in the narrow lanes flanking Via dei Tribunali, which epitomise the charm and contradictions of the city. There are the bars and restaurants that have flourished thanks to a boom in tourism; then there are the case bassi, ground-floor homes where multigenerational families live. The homes usually have just one room, and a door opening on to the street that provides the only source of air and light. “There are six or seven people living in a space of around 30 sq metres,” said Father Salvatore Melluso, a priest at Caritas Diocesana di Napoli, a church-run charity. “It’s impossible for them to stay inside, let alone maintain a distance. These families are desperate and abandoned.” Melluso, 31, worked relentlessly during the first lockdown as demand for food parcels soared. In early October, he tested positive for Covid-19 and is still in quarantine. “The problem is colossal,” he said. “People were only starting to recover from the first lockdown. I am very afraid about a civil revolt if there is a new lockdown.”
However, with hospitals under strain, the chances of averting a second lockdown are looking increasingly slim. The number of people hospitalised for Covid-19 in Campania has jumped from 474 on 3 October to more than 1,500 on Saturday, of whom 168 are in intensive care. Emergency units are filling up as people rush to them even with mild symptoms. The virus has killed two medics in recent weeks. One of the reasons for the rise in infections is because authorities have lost control of testing and tracing. Maurizio Di Mauro, the director of Cotugno hospital in Naples, which specialises in infectious diseases, is trying to manage the situation from home after contracting coronavirus. He said all of those hospitalised for Covid-19 have pneumonia. “I can’t give up,” he said. “I’m worried about the fact that we are losing track of the asymptomatic people, who are infecting entire families or transmitting the disease just by walking down the street. The more positive cases rise, the more hospitalisations will rise.” Di Mauro suggested a complete lockdown of about three weeks to allow the test-and-trace system to recuperate. “We need to move quickly,” he added. Bruno Zuccarelli, vice-president of the Naples order of doctors, said the main challenge nwas the shortage of health workers. “We have the technical capabilities, but completely lack specialists to deal with it,” he said.
Campania and the rest of southern Italy managed to avoid the worst of the initial phase of the pandemic. The contagion was slowed by the national measures, but also because people were keenly aware of the limitations of their health systems compared with those in the wealthier north. “Neapolitans respected the rules so well because they saw the terrible images from Lombardy, and they understood that if the tsunami arrived here, we wouldn’t have the hospital beds to cure them,” said Luigi de Magistris, the mayor of Naples. The mayor has clashed with regional authorities over the failure to reinforce the health system over the past six months. He said there are around 500 intensive care beds available across Campania, a region of 5.8 million people. “There are few new beds, no ambulances, we can’t do tests quickly enough or trace,” he said. “This is why people are bitter, as they see that nothing was done to prepare.”
Resentment is also being fuelled by the fact that thousands of people across Italy are still waiting on money owed to them as part of the furlough scheme. Salvatore Giugliano, the owner of the family-run restaurant, Mimi alla Ferrovia, which opened in central Naples in 1943, has been covering his staff’s furlough payments in the absence of state aid. He has also protested. “The protests are more against the institutions and their way of doing things,” he said. “They’ve asked so much of us and now threaten another lockdown without an economic plan – people are tired and exasperated.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1452,Half a million tenants in the UK battle to pay rent due to benefit cap,11/1/20,"Almost half a million low-income tenants who are claiming universal credit – many of whom were forced to apply for the benefit during the pandemic – are struggling to pay rent because it only covers the cheapest third of rents in each part of the country. New analysis by Generation Rent suggests 474,000 tenants in the UK currently face a shortfall between their universal credit housing payments and their actual market rents, including 91,904 people in the north west of England which has particularly badly hit by coronavirus. The typical rent for a two-bedroom flat in Manchester, which is under the most severe tier three Covid restrictions, is £850 a month but the most a family in the city can claim is £598 – a shortfall of £3,020 a year. In Birmingham, the gap is £1,795 a year for a similar-sized property while in Nottingham the gap is £1,424. Every region has seen substantial increases in tenants applying for universal credit since March. The number seeking help in the north west increased by just over a third in the first three months of the pandemic, with 46% of renters in the region now reliant on state support. In London, there has been a doubling of tenants claiming universal credit, with 40% of households in privately rented accommodation in the capital receiving the benefit. The analysis indicates a further 403,000 working renters could be made redundant or see their income drop in the coming months after the end of the original furlough scheme at midnight on Saturday night and as more businesses are forced to close under public health restrictions. Many more people would then become dependent on universal credit housing payments to keep their homes. Will Lewis applied for universal credit after he lost his job as a chef in September. Lewis – whose name has been changed because he fears his landlord’s reaction – already owes hundreds of pounds because his £1,200 universal credit housing payment does not cover the £1,460 rent for the small, two-bedroom flat he shares with his partner and two young children in Haringey, north London. “We are about £260 a month short on rent and that’s with cutting back on our food budget and spending almost nothing on clothes,” he said. “We’ve bought the kids some school uniform and that’s it – normally coming into winter we would buy them some new winter clothes but that can’t happen this year. It makes me feel inadequate.” Lewis is worried this could lead to the couple running up large, unmanageable debts and eventually losing their home. “Our landlord is not great – I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s already put something into the courts,” he said. “We can’t risk being evicted because we haven’t got the money for a deposit.” He has tried to speak to his landlord and his associates numerous times, as recommended by the government, but they have refused to either drop the rent or agree a repayment plan. “There are too many people out there that just want money,” Lewis said. Generation Rent called on the government to suspend evictions for arrears and ensure that the housing element of universal credit covers median rents in each part of the country. Alicia Kennedy, the campaign’s director, warned that the government would end up presiding over “mass impoverishment” unless it provided more assistance to tenants. “Thousands of renters started claiming universal credit at the start of the pandemic and have found that it is nowhere near enough to cover the rent they owe,” she said. She added that the end of the government’s furlough scheme had left many worrying about how they will keep their heads above water. “More than a million employees are at risk of redundancy and a quarter of them are private renters,” she said. A government spokesperson said: “We’ve taken unprecedented action to protect renters, including a six-month ban on evictions and have increased local housing allowance rates, benefiting more than one million households by £600 a year on average. “We’ve also raised universal credit by £1,040 a year, and a further £180m of discretionary housing payments are available for those who need additional support.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1453,Hong Kong: seven pro-democracy legislators arrested,11/1/20,"Hong Kong police have arrested seven pro-democracy legislators over a parliamentary meeting which descended into violence in May. The arrests on Sunday of lawmakers Wu Chi Wai, Andrew Wan, Helena Wong, Kwok Wing Kin, Eddie Chu, Raymond Chan and Fernando Cheung were announced on individual and party Facebook pages. Hong Kong police told the Guardian they had received a report from the Legislative Council secretariat on 8 May, the day of the meeting, and investigations led to the arrest of the seven people by the Public Order Event Investigations team on suspicion of contempt and interference with LegCo officers. “All arrestees are being detained for further enquires. The operation is under way and further arrests may be made,” police said.
At the chaotic May meeting, opposing lawmakers threw placards and scrambled over each other to take control of an important house committee that had been unable to elect a new chairperson. Pro-Beijing legislator Starry Lee took control of the committee, which had been in deadlock for weeks. The opposing camps each presented conflicting legal advice over the legality of Lee taking control and pushing through matters including controversial pieces of legislation. Security staff formed a guard protecting the chair after Lee took her seat. In the chaos, Chu attempted to climb a wall to get past the pro-Beijing crowd surrounding Lee and reach the chair, before he and others were physically carried or dragged out by security. Chan was dragged to the ground by pro-Beijing legislator Kwok Wai Kweung.
Others were shown to be dragged or knocked down, and pro-democracy legislator, Claudia Mo, who was standing away from the melee, appeared to be hit in the head by a flying placard. The arrests come amid a widespread crackdown on opposition and dissent in Hong Kong that has intensified since the introduction of the national security law in June, which outlawed acts considered to be secession, subversion, foreign collusion and terrorism. It has been widely criticised as overly broad and ill-defined, and in breach of international human rights laws. At least 27 people have been arrested under the law, including three people arrested twice.",,Foreign,Guardian,4

1455,Mexicans celebrate restricted Day of the Dead amid coronavirus upheaval,11/1/20,"José Porfirio Martínez Castro and his wife Nery Urioles Nájera were tidying up their family tomb at the municipal graveyard in Morelia. They built a small altar for two of José’s siblings and adorned it with marigolds, sugar skulls and tiny bottles of Coca-Cola – his sister’s favourite drink. Normally, they would spend the night of 1 November here, lighting candles and remembering their loved ones. But this year the cemetery will be closed because of Covid-19 restrictions, so they made their visit a few days early. “I never imagined doing this,” said Martínez, from the tomb’s shady portico. “Everything has changed in 2020.” Oceans of marigolds still adorn Mexican boulevards, sugary pan de muerto is still on sale and images of skeletons decorate everything from store windows to billboards.
But the Covid-19 pandemic has upended Day of the Dead plans. The effusive celebrations of recent years – parades inspired by the James Bond movie Spectre and “mega” altars in town squares – have been cancelled or made virtual. Cemeteries across the country have been ordered to close, forcing many families to mark the occasion at home. Mexico’s coronavirus death toll stands at around 90,000, but officials admit that the true figure may well be at least 50,000 higher.
The pandemic has shattered thousands of Mexican families – but it has also interrupted many of the country’s traditional ceremonies for commemorating the dead: churches have been closed; wakes cancelled; and communities unable to gather for novenas – prayers offered for nine consecutive days. Families who have lost loved ones in the pandemic have also suffered a social stigma in a country where conspiracy theories over coronavirus and its transmission have swirled. “They say it was diabetes, or they died of a heart attack … or it was kidney problems,” Father Raúl Vázquez, a Jesuit priest, said, describing how relatives of Covid victims refer to the cause of death. “They’re scared of being rejected by their neighbours.” The inability to properly commemorate loved ones has left many Mexicans still searching for closure.
“Death has a festive side in Mexico. But there’s also a very human side of deep pain. And the pain of death during the pandemic hasn’t had a place to be expressed,” said Abraham Villavicencio, a gallery curator in Mexico City, who studies Day of the Dead. As in other countries, coronavirus victims are often cremated instead of interred. Cemeteries have limited access, preventing large family funerals and the mariachi bands that traditionally accompany them. When Sandra Águila’s husband, Raúl, died of Covid-19 in June, she received a box of ashes from the funeral home and watched via Facebook as a priest offered prayers for multiple pandemic victims. “It was very cold, very devastating,” recalled Águila, in her home in the Xochimilco neighbourhood of Mexico City.
She still planned to construct an altar on Sunday night, but will keep it small and adorned with simple items: fruit, chocolate skulls with her husband’s name and calabaza en dulce – a traditional dish of pumpkin cooked in syrup. “Money’s pretty tight,” said Águila, a teacher. “This festival was always so beautiful, but it’s going to be pretty quiet this year.” Águila’s community of San Gregorio Atlapulco, is famed for its marigolds, which have been grown on manmade islands known as chinampas since pre-Columbian times. Normally they are harvested in time for the Day of the Dead, but this season, sales have crashed, leaving greenhouses full of rotting flowers. “We used to sell everything and prices would increase as the Day of the Dead approached,” said flower farmer Roberto de los Santos, who figured his sales would plunge 60% this year. In recent years, the Day of the Dead has become big business in some parts of Mexico. Michoacán, a state to the west of Mexico City, drew thousands of tourists to sites such as the island of Janitzio where the indigenous Purépecha people celebrate rites with boats full of flowers and candles.
“We broke records in 2019,” boasted Roberto Monroy, the tourism secretary in Morelia, the state capital. “We also broke records in 2020 – just the wrong records,” he added. Some 55,000 visited the city’s municipal graveyard last Day of the Dead. This year, the cemetery was closed on 30 October. Beforehand, long lines formed outside as people armed with buckets and brooms and clutching bouquets of marigolds waited to decorate their relatives’ graves. Only two people per family were allowed in; children, musicians and fresh food for offerings were banned. “It’s sort of sad, just like all of this year,” said Karla Tejada, a jewellery seller, as she placed marigold petals on the grave of two uncles, along with a bottle each of Coca-Cola and Victoria beer. “It will be different, but we’ll celebrate at home,” she said.

1456,Mixed messages: Boris Johnson's quotes on Covid lockdowns,11/1/20,"Boris Johnson announced a second national lockdown for England on Saturday evening. Here is what he has previously said about lockdown. On 19 March, four days before the first national lockdown was announced: I think, looking at it all, that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks and I’m absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country. On 23 March, announcing the first full lockdown: I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to. On 10 May, announcing the easing of the first lockdown It is thanks to your effort and sacrifice in stopping the spread of this disease that the death rate is coming down … It would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike.
On 17 July at a press conference: It is my strong and sincere hope that we will be able to review the outstanding restrictions and allow a more significant return to normality from November at the earliest. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph published on 19 July: I can’t abandon that tool [a second lockdown] any more than I would abandon a nuclear deterrent. But it is like a nuclear deterrent, I certainly don’t want to use it. And nor do I think we will be in that position again. In a TV address to the nation on 22 September, announcing early closing for pubs: If we were forced into a new national lockdown, that would threaten not just jobs and livelihoods but the loving human contact on which we all depend … We must do all we can to avoid going down that road again. In a statement to MPs on 12 October, announcing the three-tier alert system: This is not how we want to live our lives, but this is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic trauma of a full lockdown and the massive human and, indeed, economic cost of an uncontained epidemic.
At PMQs on 14 October: We know that it is regionally distributed, rather than nationally distributed, at the moment, and that gives us a chance to do the right thing. [Keir Starmer] wants to close pubs. He wants to close bars. He wants to close businesses in areas across the country where the incidence is low … Let us try to avoid the misery of another national lockdown, which he would want to impose, as I say, in a headlong way. At PMQs on 21 October: It is the height of absurdity that [Keir Starmer] stands up and attacks the economic consequences of the measures we are obliged to take across some parts of the country when he wants to turn the lights out with a full national lockdown.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1457,New Zealand's Labour and Greens formally sign 'cooperation' deal,11/1/20,"Jacinda Ardern’s Labour party has signed a “cooperation” agreement with the Green party, the prime minister has said, saying she hopes the agreement will be an extra level of stability for her second term in government. The Labour party scored a landslide victory in the 17 October poll, securing a parliamentary majority in its own right. However, Ardern spent the last fortnight negotiating with the Greens, and on Sunday signed a deal that gives the left-leaning party, which is outspoken on environmental and social justice issues, two ministries outside of cabinet. “This agreement is unlike any other. It does not require consensus to be formed. It allows the parties to take their own positions on issues where that is important, but offers to work together in other areas too,” Ardern said. “This cooperation agreement represents the relationship that the Labour party and the Green party have formed over the last three years and the continuation of that.
“Importantly for the government (the deal) brings stability.” Greens co-leaders James Shaw and Marama Davidson will hold the climate change and family violence portfolios respectively, and both will sit outside of cabinet. The Greens secured an increase to their vote in last month’s election by pledging to support Ardern’s government. The PM has earned record approval ratings as leader, and her government has won international and domestic praise for its handling of the pandemic, which has seen life return almost to normal in a matter of months. “The Greens campaigned on working productively with Labour to get things done, especially in the area of climate change and inequality,” Davidson said. “We are really proud of signing this agreement today.” The decision to accept the Labour offer came down to a vote of grassroots Greens members, of whom 85% voted in favour. Davidson and Labour deputy leader Kelvin Davis, who are both Māori, spoke in te reo Māori at the official signing. The parties have also agreed to progress a shared policy agenda on climate change, environment, child wellbeing and “marginalised communities” issues. In her second term, Ardern will be without a major “handbrake” encountered in her first term in office – Winston Peters’ New Zealand First party. The agreement means that Labour and the Greens can now push forward with policies they both agreed upon but New Zealand First did not. “It’s a new parliament and a new day,” Shaw, a long-time adversary of Peters, said. One of those issues, implementing pill testing at festivals, could happen soon. “That is a basic safety issue. That is about saving lives and I do think people appreciate that,” Ardern said.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1458,Nice terror attack: French police arrest three more men,11/1/20,"French police investigating the terrorist attack in Nice have arrested three more men, bringing the number of people taken in for questioning to six. A 29-year-old Tunisian man was arrested on Saturday in Grasse, and two other men aged 63 and 25 were later taken in for questioning from the same address. They join two men aged 33 and 35 picked up on Saturday and a 47-year-old who has been held since Thursday. Police say data from two telephones belonging to the alleged attacker, Brahim Aouissaoui, and CCTV footage suggest he arrived in Nice late on 27 October on a train from Rome, between 24-48 hours before the attack on Thursday morning. He was filmed near the basilica on Wednesday and during the evening phoned his family, who live near Sfax in Tunisia, to say he was in France and would be sleeping rough. At 8.29 on Thursday he entered the Notre Dame de l’Assomption basilica and is accused of carrying out an attack that left the 60-year-old worshipper Nadine Devillers and the church sexton Vincent Loquès, 55, dead and Simone Barreto Silva, 44, with fatal injuries. Silva managed to run out of the basilica and collapsed in a nearby restaurant where she died. As well as the large knife Aouissaoui allegedly used to kill the three, he had two more knives and a Qur’an in a backpack. He was shot several times by police who are still waiting to interview him in hospital where he is recovering from serious injuries. French investigators are working with their counterparts in Italy and Tunisia. It is known Aouissaoui made the crossing from Tunisia to Lampedusa in Italy, arriving on 20 September, and spent a month in Covid-19 quarantine. He was in Bari in southern Italy on 9 October but after he was refused asylum he disappeared. Churches across France were under extra protection on Sunday, All Saints Day, after the country’s security alert was raised to its highest level. Christian Estrosi, the mayor of Nice, was due to attend a ceremony of “contemplation” on Sunday evening at the Notre Dame basilica. Muslims were present for mass in a number of cities, including Blois and Toulouse, as a mark of respect for the victims of last week’s attack. Lahouary Siali, an imam in Toulouse, said they also wished to “reject the jihadis”. “These people have no spirit or reason and want to make another interpretation [of the Qur’an] that we firmly reject,” he told AFP. “We have not mandated anyone, and given no power of attorney to anyone to speak on our behalf. In the name of what philosophy, what spirituality have you come to take the lives of innocent people?” A group of young Muslims in Lodève, in the Hérault west of Montpellier, turned out to symbolically protect their local Saint-Fulcran cathedral after Thursday’s attack, saying they were fed up with being stigmatised and insulted on social media. “We are French, we were born and have grown up in Lodève, a place where different communities live together. There’s a cathedral and a mosque and never any problems between religions,” said Elyazid, who organised the gathering. The French interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, told La Voix du Nord newspaper on Sunday that Aouissaoui “was only present on our national territory for a few hours. He’d clearly come to kill. Otherwise how do you explain he had only just arrived and he had several knives? Of course it’s for the anti-terrorist prosecutor to establish how his murderous project was planned, but he clearly didn’t come to obtain papers.” He said France had sent “hundreds of extra police” to the Italian border, but added: “Unlike the far right, I don’t wish to see a terrorist in every foreigner.” The recent attacks in France have led to a reported spate of vandalism against mosques in the country. Two people were arrested over the weekend after being caught spraying graffiti on the mosque at Panitin in Seine-Saint-Denis, which has been closed for six months for broadcasting a video criticising Samuel Paty’s course in which he showed pupils caricatures of the prophet Muhammad. Four mosques in Rouen also reported received threatening letters following the Nice attack. Further south in the Drôme, a Muslim prayer hall was tagged with crosses.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1459,Northern mayors accuse government of southern bias in lockdown rules,11/1/20,"Northern leaders have accused the government of valuing their region’s workers less than those in the south after extending the 80% furlough for the national lockdown but refusing to do the same for northerners last month. The mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool city region, which were among the first parts of the country to be subject to tier 3 restrictions, expressed anger at Westminster’s “differential” treatment of workers in the north of England at a press conference on Sunday. “This morning millions of people woke up knowing the prime minister of this country believes the north is worth less than the south,” Steve Rotheram, the Liverpool city region mayor, said. “Quite frankly, the government has treated us with contempt again.” Announcing England’s month-long shutdown on Saturday night, Boris Johnson extended the furlough scheme until December, with the government paying 80% of workers’ wages. But last month, the government had been “unequivocal” in refusing to stump up more than two-thirds of the pay of hospitality workers across the north whose businesses were forced to close under tier 3 measures, Rotheram told the conference. The mayor added that “red wall” areas would not be “fooled” into electing the Conservatives again. “I can assure the government that the people of the north won’t easily forget that they were judged to be worth less than their southern counterparts,” he said. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, called for an end to the government’s “differential treatment” of people on low wages and “people in the north versus people in the south”. Talks between Burnham and the government collapsed 12 days ago over a difference of £5m – less than £2 for each of Greater Manchester’s 2.8 million residents – after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, refused to pay tier 3 furlough at 80%. Sunak tweeted the news of his change of heart on Saturday night, prompting Burnham to respond: “But when we asked you to do that for the lowest-paid people in the north, you refused. People here will remember that.” At the conference, Burnham added that people in the region had “just completed three months of morale-sapping restrictions, and now they are waking up to the prospect of a month of even tougher restrictions”. “I honestly don’t believe that is understood in Westminster, that already, people have been ground down by the restrictions they have been living under, and they need to understand that before we go any further forward,” he said. Burnham also called for work to be done on a “substantial localisation” of the test-and-trace system, for self-employed people to be financially supported and for schools to close for two weeks for a “true circuit break”.
The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, rejected the accusations of differential treatment, saying it was fair to offer more now because the national restrictions were more onerous. Gove told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show he had “huge respect” for Rotheram but that “workers, whether they are in the north or in the south are being asked, families are being asked, to do more than was the case even in tier 3 areas”. He said those offered two-thirds furlough last month could have topped up their wages to 80% or more with universal credit. Anger and frustration was building across the north of England on Sunday, particularly from pub landlords who had spent time and money rushing to offer “substantial meals” to comply with restrictions, who will now have to shut on Thursday regardless. There was particular frustration in West Yorkshire, which reluctantly agreed on Thursday to go into tier 3. Pubs were due to shut in the region on Monday, with some working round the clock to find a way to stay open by serving “substantial meals” and effectively operating as a restaurant. But now they must close on Thursday but can stay open until then, after tier 3 was cancelled for West Yorkshire. In Bradford, Daniel Horsman, a pub landlord, had spent Saturday making 150 pies he hoped to sell to every customer next week with their pints. He has run the Jacob’s Well since 2018 and complains of having to “completely redesign my business model every few weeks when the government changes its mind”. There have been seven different rule changes since he was able to reopen in July. “It’s been bloody knackering,” he said, admitting there were times he considered shutting completely. “It has been extremely frustrating and I do feel angry at the way this has all been orchestrated, with late-night, last-minute changes.” He does not know whether he will be able to stay open during the lockdown by offering takeaway pies, saying it will not make financial sense if doing so would disqualify him for any business grant.
In a statement, West Yorkshire council leaders said: “Following several days of intense discussions with ministers about the introduction of new restrictions in West Yorkshire, we are frustrated and angry about the government’s timing, handling and communications around the plans for a national lockdown. “Firstly, for our residents and businesses, we must clear up understandable confusion: the region will now NOT be moving into tier 3 (very high) measures on Monday as planned; we will remain in tier 2 (high) restrictions, and then follow the national measures from Thursday 5 November until Wednesday 2 December. “The residents and businesses of West Yorkshire had only just begun to prepare for tier 3 measures to hit on Monday, and they are now having to change their plans once again. “We have worked hard over the last few days to advocate for the people and businesses of West Yorkshire. It is imperative that government now honours the financial commitments made to the people and businesses of the region during these discussions in writing again now.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1460,Papua New Guinea to give $3m to unknown firm for Covid treatment,11/1/20,"Papua New Guinea has approved nearly $US3m from its threadbare budget for an as-yet-unidentified Covid-19 treatment – allocating the money to an unknown biomedical company that was formed in August. The prime minister, James Marape, has insisted the national executive council had not completed its approval process to engage a PNG company to find a treatment, but leaked cabinet documents appear to show 10.2m Kina (US$2.85m) being awarded to Niugini BioMed Ltd for research into discovering a new treatment for Covid-19 infections from existing drugs. The cabinet submission, splashed on the front page of a national newspaper, claimed a University of Papua New Guinea team had “scanned and analysed” 30,000 known drugs worldwide to identify 10 potential treatments.
“The team is highly confident this discovery could be potentially used as a treatment for Covid-19 infections,” the submission, dated 20 October, says. The submission, signed by Marape, “directs ministers, treasury and finance to make available 10.2 million Kina immediately for the procurement of Covid-19 drugs, commencement of treatment on Covid-19 patients in the country”. It also directs the national department of health to establish a collaboration with Niugini BioMed “to immediately run clinical treatment and trials”. While treatment of Covid-19 has improved globally since the outbreak of the pandemic, lowering death rates, there is no vaccine for the virus. Several potential vaccines are undergoing trial internationally. Marape said that there was “nothing illegal or improper” about the government engaging PNG chemists, biologists and doctors to research possible vaccines for Covid-19.
Marape said: “We have young and competent PNG scientists, who have presented their case to the Covid-19 controller ... and our medical and science community, that they may be on to something big. “It may be true, or vice-versa, but I am not a prime minister to kill ingenuity, research, science and study. We are a nation of huge biodiversity … our ancestors lived with malaria, snake bites and all manner of tropical diseases. “I am certain that we can find new medicines, amidst all this biodiversity, in our blessed land.” Marape hit back at those condemning the deal. “To my critics; don’t think I am stupid. I know exactly what I want to do for my country.” The health minister, Sir Puka Temu, told the Guardian he supported the submission, arguing PNG had not spent enough money researching treatments for the coronavirus. He said his department would ensure BioMed’s research “will be done properly, [and] meets global scientific research standards”. Devastated by Covid-19 shutdowns PNG’s budget is under intense pressure. The government is seeking a US$100m top-up to an emergency loan of US$310m from Australia last year, and still has unpaid liabilities, including a massive superannuation bill, of more than $770m. PNG’s opposition leader, Belden Namah, said it was irresponsible of cabinet – and risked a “total waste of funds” – to back a brand-new company with no previous records of drug research and production to research a cure for coronavirus. Niugini BioMed chairman Dr Bomai Kerenga argued individual countries must fend for themselves against the Covid-19 pandemic, and PNG was no exception. “For this reason, we have mobilised a team of highly qualified and talented medical doctors and scientists to research for Covid-19 cure among the generic drugs.”
He said the company had been established in August to protect its research and intellectual property, and had obtained the genomic data of the coronavirus. “We need this information to develop vaccine and identify drugs to repurpose for treatment against Covid-19.” PNG has recorded just 589 confirmed cases of Covid-19, with seven deaths. But the actual rate of infection is likely far higher, with dangerously low rates of testing across the country.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1461,Police in England fear flouting of lockdown rules after breaking up weekend raves,11/1/20,"Police broke up a string of raves across England over the weekend, including one involving 1,000 people, raising fears that there may be numerous breaches of the country’s Covid-19 laws in the days before the second national lockdown begins. The decision to impose the new restrictions has also led police leaders to voice concern that officers already under strain face enforcing the new lockdown on a weary public. They also anticipate more officers may be absent with Covid than during the first national shutdown.
The Metropolitan police said it had broken up a rave in east London attended by 1,000 people. The force said seven people had been arrested under the coronavirus regulations for holding or being involved in the staging of the unlicensed event, and that they may face £10,000 fines. The Met, which covers London, said it had dealt with 11 unlicensed music events and illegal large-scale gatherings on Saturday, including a christening in Tottenham, north London. Commander Ade Adelekan said: “If you think the next few days are an excuse to break the rules, think again. You will get caught, we will take action and impose the maximum sanctions.
“As well as music events there were numerous gatherings which flout the rule of six. We are still in a pandemic and it is extremely selfish of the small minority of people to carry on without regard for the regulations.” About 500 gathered for a rave at a warehouse in Yate near Bristol, where police said some of the crowd became violent when ordered to disperse and arrests were made. Some people were still present on Sunday afternoon. Another 300 attended a rave at a farm in Wigan, and police turned more away. Police said the tyres on seven of their vehicles had been slashed and that a 26-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of not providing personal details for a fixed penalty notice under Covid laws. A 36-year-old was arrested for alleged possession of class A drugs. Assistant chief constable Rob Potts of Greater Manchester police said: “A comprehensive investigation has been launched to bring the organisers to justice. Where there are blatant breaches there will be robust enforcement.” During the last lockdown young people were most likely to come into conflict with police enforcing the coronavirus regulations. One senior police source said it was not just the public but also officers who were weary after months of changing restrictions, particularly in areas with higher infection rates. The source said they had been working hard to enforce regulations to contain the virus: “This comes in addition to the day-to-day stuff and is difficult. Officers have been working longer hours through overtime, with less days off.”
A return to national restrictions should be simpler to police than a patchwork of local and regional rules, but police chiefs are bracing themselves for potentially higher absences than during the first lockdown. The greater availability of testing may mean more officers have to stay at home than during the first lockdown, when absence rates were far lower than feared. John Apter, the chair of the Police Federation, said: “Policing is already under enough pressure. My colleagues have been doing their best to police restrictions which have changed on a regular basis and have often been confusing. “It is clear that the virus has not gone away and is spreading at an alarming rate. We must be clear in what we are asking of the public and what we are expecting of the police. The information from government must be clear and unambiguous. Anything less makes the policing of this pandemic even more challenging than it is already.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1462,Release of lauded Iranian documentary halted amid dispute with TV film-makers,11/1/20,"Coup 53 was heralded by critics this summer as a “powerful and authoritative” documentary “as gripping as any thriller”, and judged by historians as crucial to understanding Britain’s relationship with the Middle East. Made over 10 years by Walter Murch, the celebrated editor of Apocalypse Now and The English Patient, in collaboration with the Anglo-Iranian director Taghi Amirani, it tells the story of covert British intervention in Iran after the second world war and stars Ralph Fiennes, left, as an MI6 spy in a reconstruction of a key incident. The film’s fresh perspective prompted widespread positive reaction among foreign affairs journalists, including Channel 4’s news anchor Jon Snow, who called it “utterly brilliant”. But now some of the biggest names in British television, including the veteran documentary-maker Brian Lapping, have complained, alleging Coup 53 undermines their reputations by suggesting they kept government secrets when they first told the story on television in 1985 in the landmark Channel 4 series End of Empire, made by Granada TV. Meanwhile, ITV, which owns the copyright to End of Empire, has withdrawn permission for excerpts from that programme to be shown in Coup 53. Its decision meant that the film, which went on general release online on 19 August, had to be withdrawn from streaming four weeks later. Lord Puttnam, a major figure in British film history and a mentor of Amirani, spoke this weekend of his regret about the row and of the halting of Coup 53, saying he found the situation “heartbreaking”. Baroness Kennedy has been asked to mediate between the two sets of warring documentary-makers, but negotiations have broken down. This weekend, Amirani and Murch told the Observer they now face a painful choice between a long legal battle or making expensive changes to important elements of their film in order to regain the right to use footage from End of Empire. “In our documentary, we say how much we admired the research the Granada team had carried out back then,” said Murch. “It is very sad that audiences can no longer see our film, given the years we have spent on it and the positive response it has had for a year at film festivals.”
Amirani added that the “cover-up” he hoped to expose, and the one he refers to when promoting his film, was carried out by the British government, not by the makers of End of Empire. “The whole reason we made the film was to tell the full story of what happened in Iran,” he said. “The British government have still not officially admitted what it did.” Lapping, whose criticisms have been backed by many of television’s leading figures, including former Channel 4 executive Liz Forgan, believes the new documentary implies his earlier coverage of the same historic events in Iran was compromised by government pressure, something he denies. “Coup 53 clearly implies that our team was leaned on by government to remove an alleged filmed interview; that End of Empire was complicit in censorship,” Lapping said. “We are consulting solicitors. We would much prefer not to go to the law. We will only do so if we do not get a positive response to our requests.” At the centre of the argument is the undisputed British secret service provocation of the Iranian coup d’etat of 1953: an attempt to unseat the country’s first democratic leader, Mohammad Mossadegh, in order to reinstate the Shah on the throne. The move was secretly desired by both Britain’s postwar government and America, as a way to ensure “stability” and secure lucrative colonial interests in Iran’s oil industry. In 1985, researchers working for Lapping at Granada interviewed a former intelligence officer who claimed to have orchestrated the coup. Norman Darbyshire, played in Coup 53 by Fiennes, detailed exactly how his actions had been calculated to prompt unrest and ultimately led to the toppling of Mossadegh’s regime. The MI6 officer said that, as part of “Operation Boot”, he spent “vast sums of money”, well over a million and a half pounds”, adding: “I was personally giving orders and directing the street uprising.” But he does not appear in the Iranian episode of End of Empire and both Lapping and one of his main researchers, Alison Rooper, says she is sure he was not filmed and did not agree to give direct testimony. Yet Darbyshire’s explosive evidence was recorded in a typed transcript that somehow made its way to the Observer journalist Nigel Hawkes the week before the episode was broadcast in 1985.
“They may have made a mistake in giving it to me,” said Hawkes this weekend, “but it gave lots of detail about how the coup was organised, so it was a decent story.” Donald Trelford, then editor of the Observer, recalls the powerful story that Hawkes wrote up, quoting from Darbyshire’s account, although also indicating that the former intelligence officer would not appear on screen. “The involvement of the CIA and MI6 in the coup was widely known about by then, so that wasn’t the story. We were interested in the Darbyshire interview because it provided official confirmation of it and colourful details about M16’s dirty tricks,” he said. No further media coverage followed the revelations, but Trelford says he believes the government did not issue a “D-notice”, an official instruction preventing publication. “We had no approach from the Foreign Office or anybody else. I was a member of the D-notice committee at the time, so I would have known.” “I do not know who handed it over to the Observer,” said Rooper last week. “Presumably, the idea was to publicise the programme.” The picture is muddied by the fact that a CIA operative also active in the field, Stephen Meade, was interviewed on the record and filmed for End of Empire, although he also did not appear in the episode. Amirani and Murch used Meade’s archived, unseen interview in their new film and suspected that similar footage of Darbyshire might also exist. The Darbyshire transcript was, however, later seen by the author Stephen Dorril and used in his book MI6. Rooper and Dorril both appear in Coup 53; and on screen the former Granada researcher tells Amirani and Murch the agent never agreed to be filmed but is unclear in recollecting details of the interview process. She and Lapping claim this creates an unfair impression and suggests they had agreed to suppress content. In 1953, after the ousting of Mossadegh, the Shah flew back to Iran from exile in Italy and ruled until the 1979 revolution that set up the current religious regime. Darbyshire died in 1993. • This article was amended on 3 December 2020 to reflect and clarify that the rights to End of Empire, which includes decisions over the licensing of footage, are held by ITV (ITV Studios Global Distribution). It was also amended to include that Alison Rooper told Coup 53 that Norman Darbyshire did not agree to be filmed.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1463,"Routine operations will be cancelled despite England lockdown, doctors say",11/1/20,"Hospitals will be forced to cancel routine operations across England due to pressures from resurgent Covid despite the new lockdown measures, doctors’ leaders have warned. The NHS is facing potentially “impossible” demands in the months ahead and hospitals everywhere would soon have to follow the lead of those in the north of England and Midlands by cancelling non-essential surgery, against the wishes of NHS bosses and ministers. Doctors’ leaders also said the new lockdown in England was necessary and inevitable but warned that tens of thousands of NHS vacancies across the service would make the Nightingale field hospitals hard to staff during a surge of Covid patients. “Things are going to get worse in the NHS before they get better, even with the lockdown, because it takes time for people who have been infected to get sick and come to hospital. So the impact on changes to transmission rates from the lockdown will take a while to show up,” said Dr Tom Dolphin, a consultant anaesthetist and member of the British Medical Association’s council. Dr Claudia Paoloni, president of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association, said: “It’s difficult to predict if this [lockdown] will be sufficient, being implemented so late and missing the opportunity of half-term school closures, especially as it is a modified and not full lockdown, with schools, universities and manufacturing kept open. “Although this can certainly reduce the infection rate, if adhered to fully, whether it can get the R rate [the average number of people each case infects] below 1 and keep NHS capacity to a manageable level will need close monitoring.” Hospitals will find it hard to treat both Covid patients and those with other illnesses unless the public strictly follow the new rules from Thursday, warned Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine. “The NHS won’t collapse but patients with non-Covid illnesses will suffer if we don’t control transmission and more people will die,” she said. “Intensive care units have seen a steady increase in the number of Covid cases. Staff are back in full PPE, working in surge capacity, non-ICU staff are helping out. Routine operations are being cancelled in order to accommodate Covid patients. It all feels like deja vu but with the added burden of trying to maintain as much non-Covid activity as possible.” NHS England and Boris Johnson want normal NHS care, especially surgery, to continue during the second wave, unlike in the spring, when it was mostly suspended. But Dr Sue Crossland, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said that was unlikely to prove possible and that the needs of people needing life or death care because of Covid must take priority. “A second lockdown was inevitable given the exponential rise in cases. We are now at a point where we have to minimise the risk between caring for Covid patients and ensuring that other patients waiting for treatment are also cared for in a timely fashion. It is difficult, if not impossible, to square this circle,” she said. “The difficult decisions being advised by the scientific evidence and Sage are not easy, but we need to ensure we protect the vulnerable and keep the NHS working for those who need it most.” The BMA’s Dolphin agreed. “You can’t turn Covid patients who are septic and breathless and unwell away at the front door. You’ve got to admit them. [But] then you’ve got no beds to admit people in for other conditions,” he said. Senior doctors are divided over what role the seven Nightingale field hospitals might play this time. The first to open, in London, was the only one to care for patients in the spring. Paoloni said: “The NHS has one of the lowest hospital bed bases in Europe. There are 246 beds per 100,000 population in the UK compared to 800 per 100,000 in Germany. [Given that] I suspect the Nightingales will have to be used, but staffing levels will restrict what they can be used for.” Nightingales in Manchester, Harrogate and Sunderland have been put on standby. Dolphin cautioned that the more than 100,000 vacancies in the NHS makes staffing the field hospitals difficult. “A lot of people are saying ‘the Nightingales will save us’. But I’m not convinced they’re necessarily going to be the answer to everything. They are physically there and have beds and equipment you need, like ventilators. But who is going to staff them? There aren’t any extra doctors or nurses sitting out there doing nothing, waiting to be called up to the Nightingales.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1464,Russia rules out cutting fossil fuel production in next few decades,11/1/20,"Russia has no plans to rein in its production of fossil fuels in the coming decades despite the global efforts to shift towards low-carbon energy, according to its energy minister. Alexander Novak told the Guardian that Russia did “not see that we will achieve a peak in [gas] production anytime soon” because the world’s appetite for gas would continue to grow in the decades ahead despite its growing number of climate targets. Instead, during a crucial decade in the battle to keep a lid on rising global temperatures, Russia will pair a 50% growth in gas production with plans to become a global leader in producing clean-burning hydrogen and developing carbon capture technology. Russia intends to ramp up gas production from its vast and inexpensive reserves to reach 1tn cubic meters a year by 2035, from just under 680bn cubic meters last year. It also plans to increase the amount of gas it exports on giant super-chilled tankers more than four-fold, from 29m tonnes a year to 120-140m tonnes, while continuing to send about 200bn cubic meters of gas to Europe via pipelines including the politically contentious Nord Stream project. “I believe natural gas to be an eco-friendly energy source,” said Novak. “We believe that the share of natural gas in the global energy mix will only increase. We believe this to apply not only to Europe, but globally too.” Energy economists forecast that demand for gas will continue to grow, particularly in Asia, as more countries draw a line on burning coal, which emits almost double the carbon dioxide of gas. But EU demand for gas, of which 30% is met by Russia’s state gas monopoly Gazprom, could fall 8% below 2019 levels by the end of the decade, according to the latest report from the International Energy Agency. Novak said Russia also planned to become a global player in the hydrogen economy, by producing and transporting the clean-burning alternative to traditional fossil fuel gas. Hydrogen can be produced either by using renewable energy to split water molecules in a process known as electrolysis, or by splitting off the carbon dioxide from gas through pyrolysis. Novak said Russia was able to do both and was also developing technology to capture the carbon emissions created during hydrogen production to offer a genuinely “green” gas to its customers using Russia’s existing gas transport channels. “All this has been quite expensive so far, but we believe that just like with the renewable energy sources, prices will go down over time, which will determine the pace of hydrogen adoption. To put it briefly, we can produce hydrogen and use it, as well as deliver it to consumers. We can also export the hydrogen production technologies,” Novak said.
Pursuing hydrogen production would safeguard Russia’s fossil fuel economy while helping to reduce emissions worldwide. But environmental groups, including Carbon Action Tracker, have nonetheless branded Russia’s climate plans “critically insufficient”. The emissions targets set through the Paris Agreement are set against levels in 1990, which for Russia marked its highest emissions on record. The collapse of Soviet-era industries in the early 1990s halved the country’s emissions within a matter of years, meaning it would take very little effort for the Kremlin to record emissions which are between 25-30% lower than levels in 1990 by 2030. Novak said: “We are working very actively in Russia, pursuing the climate agenda, working to decrease the greenhouse and CO2 emissions, and we’re working on these issues on a systematic basis.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1465,Russia's remote regions struggle to cope with burgeoning Covid cases,11/1/20,"Months after the Kremlin said it had the coronavirus pandemic under control, record numbers of Russians are falling ill and dying of the disease every day, pushing the country’s health services to breaking point while Vladimir Putin has ruled out a new nationwide lockdown. The official daily tally of new cases rose above 18,000 for the first time on Friday, when 355 deaths were also reported. Critics say the death toll indicated by tallies of excess deaths could be far higher. The increases have mirrored those in European countries such as France and Spain, but the brunt of the outbreak has been borne by far-flung regions that rarely make the evening news. As opposed to the spring outbreak, when Moscow, St Petersburg and the Caucasus region were worst affected, the new rise has been driven by the disease’s spread across the Urals, Siberia and the border with Kazakhstan, where colder weather has already driven many people indoors. The images coming from Russia’s regions have been grisly. In the cities of Barnaul and Novokuznetsk, bleak videos have surfaced showing the bodies of coronavirus victims clogging hospital corridors. “There are bodies everywhere,” an anonymous videographer said in one clip.
Regional officials later confirmed the images. They said they didn’t have enough pathologists to carry out autopsies, so the bodies remained on trolleys and the floors of a hospital basement that serves as a makeshift morgue. Ambulance drivers in Omsk have complained of hospitals turning them away, forcing them to protest with sirens blaring in front of a regional health ministry building. Doctors in Kurgan said the health system had collapsed and called on the government to send military medics. “There are no places in the hospitals, there are not enough medical personnel,” they wrote in an open letter. A shortage of oxygen in a hospital in southern Rostov-on-Don led to the deaths of as many as 13 patients in a single day, sparking an official inquiry. “The patients were panicking, trying to get oxygen from anywhere … they were like fish pulled out of the water,” Artur Toporov, an anaesthesiologist who was on call during the incident, told Novaya Gazeta. “We spoke to them. We could not do anything else for them.” Authorities have not confirmed how many people died, but a criminal investigation has been launched into five deaths.
Even Russia’s political class has been hit. A fifth of the MPs in the 450-seat Duma have fallen ill with the disease and 18 of the heads of country’s 85 regions have also been infected. The mayor of Ufa, a city of more than a million and capital of the Bashkortostan region, died of the disease on Wednesday, 35 days after testing positive. Medics in several cities reached by the Guardian complained of poor preparation for the new rise in cases and an “unrealistic” workload for doctors. “People are acting like they are invincible, like they were already victorious, nobody is taking basic precautions,” said Maria, a paediatrician from Chelyabinsk, where infections increased sharply in September. “Conditions are just as bad as they were in spring, nothing has changed.” A hospital doctor in the hard-hit Altai region described pressure to discharge patients because of a lack of beds. Russia’s deputy prime minister, Tatiana Golikova, told Putin on Wednesday that 16 regions were in a critical situation with more than 90% of hospital beds occupied. Five of them were at more than 95% of capacity.
Experts are hesitant to call it a second wave. They say that in most regions the first wave never truly receded. The data in recent weeks, however, has been extremely alarming. “It’s much worse than in the first months,” said Alexey Raksha, an independent demographer who previously worked for the government statistics agency Rosstat. He cited rising official tallies, past data on excess deaths and experimental data collated by colleagues that shows an increasing number of internet searches for coronavirus symptoms. “I’m expecting huge excess mortality in October and unprecedented in November,” he said. Excess mortality refers to the number of people who die in a given period above a past average, and it is an alternative way to estimate the toll taken by the coronavirus. Reuters reported last month that excess mortality in Russia from May to July was more than triple the official number of coronavirus deaths, leaving tens of thousands of deaths unexplained. Raksha criticised tallies published on the government’s StopCoronavirus website, saying they should be “multiplied by four to get a much clearer picture”. The country’s current death toll is 27,656, but an estimate based on a proportion of excess mortality since April would put it between 120,000 and 130,000, he said. Russian agencies have taken steps to block leaks. The health ministry has barred employees, including many doctors, from speaking to the media without coordinating with its press office. Data on deaths from the regions can take months to reach the public. Many civil registration offices had stopped reporting data on deaths, Raksha said, citing instances in ten regions, particularly those hard-hit by the virus. “We need something better. The official statistics are not up to it.”
The Russian government has defended its conservative methodologies, including the requirement that coronavirus diagnoses be confirmed by an autopsy. The lack of qualified pathologists to perform them is part of the official reason for the buildup of bodies in regional hospitals. Officials say a lack of morgue space and families’ slowness to retrieve bodies are also factors. Russia has, however, resisted declaring a new coronavirus lockdown. “We’re not planning sweeping restrictive measures, the initiation of a so-called nationwide lockdown, which would lead to practically a complete shutdown of the economy and business operations,” Putin said at an investment conference on Thursday. Sergei Sobyanin, the influential mayor of Moscow, said: “I very much hope that none of the severe measures being applied in Europe, in France, Germany and other countries, will be applied here.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1466,Scholars warn of collapse of democracy as Trump v Biden election looms,11/1/20,"Dozens of historians of fascism and authoritarianism have signed a letter warning that democracy “is either withering or in full-scale collapse globally”, and urging ordinary people to take action.
“Democracy is extremely fragile and potentially temporary, requiring vigilance and protection,” the scholars wrote in the letter released on Sunday. “It is not too late to turn the tide.” More than 80 signatories, including professors and other scholars at universities in the US, Canada, and Europe, do not agree on whether to label Donald Trump a “fascist”. The fragility of democracy worldwide, they write, will continue to be an issue “irrespective of who wins the American presidency”. “Whether Donald J Trump is a fascist, a post-fascist populist, an autocrat or just a bumbling opportunist, the danger to democracy did not arrive with his presidency and goes well beyond 3 November 2020,” the scholars write, referring to election day on Tuesday, when Trump will face Joe Biden at the polls. However, the historians warn, particularly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, “the temptation to take refuge in a figure of arrogant strength is now greater than ever”. They suggest citizens must be ready not only to defend democracy at the ballot box, but “if necessary, also through non-violent protests in the streets”. “That’s the lesson, to not be complacent in moments like this,” said Jennifer Evans, a professor of German history at Carleton University in Canada and one of the lead organizers of the open letter. “This is a very dangerous time, and we all have a responsibility to prop up democracy.” Among the many warning signs that democracy is at risk, the historians argue, are the spread of disinformation, inequality, the “politics of internal enemies” and politically motivated violence. “We need to reveal and denounce any and all connections between those in power and those vigilante and militia forces using political violence to destabilize our democracies,” the letter urges. Evans said she was particularly disturbed by the evidence of “the infiltration of the far right” in police and military organizations around the world, including in the US, Germany, and Canada. Signatories to the letter include several authors who have commented on authoritarianism and fascism during Trump’s presidency, including Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor at New York University, and Jason Stanley, the author of How Fascism Works.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1467,Shooting of priest shocks France as two more held over Nice killings,11/1/20,"French police were hunting a gunman who shot and seriously injured a Greek Orthodox priest in the city of Lyon yesterday afternoon. The latest attack came two days after a terrorist killed three people at a church in Nice and two weeks after the beheading of a high school teacher. Police and soldiers immediately sealed off Lyon’s 7th arrondissement in the hunt for the gunman and later made an arrest. The priest, said to be a Greek national aged 52, was closing the church when the man armed with a sawn-off shotgun fired at him several times, hitting him twice in the stomach. French TV is reporting that it seems to be a “personal dispute”. Police are saying they are looking at all motives, but are advising journalists not to jump to conclusions that the incident is “terror” linked, despite the tensions and high level of alert in France.
On Saturday, French anti-terrorist police were still questioning three men in connection with the Nice attack as they tried to piece together the killer’s movements and establish if he had accomplices. A man, aged 47, who was taken into police custody hours after the attack on Thursday and was reported to have been in contact with knifeman Brahim Issaoui the previous day, is still being held. Investigators gave no more details of the arrests of two other men aged 33 and 35. Issaoui, a 21-year-old Tunisian who killed the three people at the city’s Notre Dame basilica, remains in a serious condition in hospital after being shot by police inside the church. Issaoui was originally named as Aouissaoui based on an Italian Red Cross document he was carrying, but his correct identity was confirmed by his family at Bou Hajla near Sfax in Tunisia. Over the weekend, shocked and grieving locals continued to lay flowers outside the Notre Dame de l’Assomption basilica. In the crowds, one woman’s cry rose like a collective wail: “Why us? Why us again?” It was a sentiment echoed across France. The Nice killings hit a country already reeling from the beheading of a history teacher outside his high school near Paris less than two weeks before. Samuel Paty, 47, had shown pupils two caricatures of the prophet Muhammad as part of a discussion on free speech. The reprinting of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons has provoked a wave of anti-French protests in Islamic countries, and France has been on high alert. On Saturday, President Emmanuel Macron tried to calm anti-French protests in a 55-minute interview with Al Jazeera. Macron said he “understands the feelings of Muslims about the caricatures” of the prophet. “The caricatures are not a government project but rather the product of free and independent newspapers that are not affiliated with the government.” He added: “I think the reactions were due to lies and misrepresentation and because people think I am in favour of these caricatures.”
As the government began expelling individuals and disbanding organisations it accused of fostering “Islamism” – which in French is understood to mean “Islamist fundamentalism” – in the wake of Paty’s murder on 16 October, the terrorist attack in Nice came as a further kick to a country that was still down. Hours later, a stringent new national Covid-19 lockdown came into effect adding to a sense of dejection. The despondency was particularly acute in Nice. In five years, the Riviera city has suffered three terrorist attacks. In February 2015, three soldiers patrolling outside a Jewish community centre in Nice were wounded by a man vowing allegiance to Islamic State. In 2016, a terrorist drove a lorry into crowds celebrating Bastille Day, killing 86 and injuring 458. Last week had started with Turkey and France trading verbal blows and anti-Macron protests after the French president insisted that newspapers and magazines like Charlie Hebdo had the right to publish contested caricatures. By midweek, it was, according to the interior minister, Gérard Darmanin, “a war”, not of words but of ideologies. Then came Nice. A lone candle on the granite pavement next to a small bunch of primroses marked the spot where 44-year-old Simone Barreto Silva collapsed from her knife wounds. It was here, at the Unik kebab shop, while being tended to by paramedics, that she uttered her final words: “Tell my children I love them.” Michel Atiah, head waiter at the neighbouring Le Socrate restaurant, described Silva as the life and soul of the party. “She was a lovely woman and very popular in the neighbourhood.” Another regular at Le Socrate was Vincent Loquès, the church sexton, who died inside the basilica. “We often saw him. Vincent was a lovely, gentle man who used to eat here regularly. “This is a mixed community – I am originally from Syria. We all deplore this action. Nice has been rocked by what happened yesterday and by what happened on the seafront four years ago. But it is important to remember that these are lone wolves, not representative of the Islamic community.”
On Saturday, the killer’s first victim was named as 60-year-old Nadine Devillers. “She often went to pray for people she loved. From time to time she lit a candle. She was someone who loved others, gave everything for others,” her friend Joëlle Guichard told Nice-Matin newspaper. Inevitably, the far right has called for expulsions and a moratorium on immigration from certain countries holding anti-French protests. Marine Le Pen has called the attacks “acts of war” requiring a warlike response. At a rally in Nice on Thursday night her supporters chanted for Muslims to “go home”, and in rue Alsace Lorraine near the basilica, protesters banged on the windows of a north African restaurant. “That is not the intelligent approach to take,” said Nathalie, who works at the Brunet bakery in the same street. “Taking reprisals against innocent folk is not going to put right the act of a lone madman.” She added: “Monsieur Loquès came here practically every day for his baguettes. He was a kind and gentle man. I don’t think we are in danger of being overwhelmed by hate, more of an explosion of anger. We must be wary of that.” On Sunday, French soldiers, police and gendarmes will be dispatched to protect churches and other places of worship for the important Toussaint – All Saints – holiday. In Trappes, south-west of Paris in the Yvelines – the department where Paty was killed – which has a large Muslim community officials and religious leaders will plant an olive tree outside the Catholic church. Ali Rabeh, the mayor of Trappes, said it was a “symbolic gesture of solidarity” with the Catholic community. Rabeh has cautioned politicians against ramping up the rhetoric of war and stigmatising “the “99.9% of French Muslims who are calm, peaceful and don’t want to bother anyone”. “The political atmosphere is becoming more and more accusatory. Each time there is an attack, ordinary Muslims feel the finger is being pointed at them, that they carry the weight of accusations,” Rabeh told the Observer. He said he was appalled to discover that his father, a Muslim who came to France from Morocco 50 years ago and had worked “to help build this country” for more than four decades, “now feels he has to lower his head when he goes shopping”.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1468,Spain's PM calls for calm after violent anti-lockdown protests,11/1/20,"Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has called for an end to “the violent and irrational behaviour” of a minority of people after a weekend of angry demonstrations in cities around the country against the government’s decision to declare a six-month state of emergency in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Thirty-two people were arrested and 12 injured in Madrid on Saturday night after a protest over the region’s midnight to 6am curfew turned violent, with rubbish bins set alight on the city’s Gran Vía and skirmishes with police. There were also protests over the weekend in Barcelona, Málaga, Vitoria, Valencia, Santander and Burgos. Police in Logroño, the capital of the La Rioja region, arrested six people on Saturday night after bins were torched and some shops smashed and looted. Videos showed shop windows being broken and large crowds of people running from riot police. One shop owner in the city said she had lost stock and money to the looters. “They broke three display windows, ransacked them and half the shop, broke mannequins, helped themselves to the clothes racks, ripped off the computer and took money from the cash till,” Cristina Pérez told local TV. However, on Sunday morning groups of young people from the city took to the streets to begin clearing up the previous night’s mess and debris. Sánchez, who secured parliamentary support earlier this week for the six-month state of emergency, appealed for calm and solidarity. “Only through responsibility, unity and sacrifice will we be able to beat this pandemic that is ravaging every country,” he tweeted on Saturday night. “The violent and irrational behaviour of minority groups is intolerable. This isn’t the way.” The president of the Madrid region, who has clashed with Sánchez and accused the central government of overstepping its powers, also called for responsibility. “The people sowing chaos on the streets are not those most vulnerable to the virus, nor are they the ones fighting for their lives,” said Isabel Díaz Ayuso. “They are organised groups looking to take advantage of the situation and people’s fears.”
Although some of the protests have been led by far-left groups, police believe some of the demonstrations have involved “far-right elements”. The far-right Vox party, which has bitterly criticised the Socialist-led government’s handling of the pandemic, has done little to defuse tensions. Its leader, Santiago Abascal, has said “there are more reasons than ever to protest against this government which is ruining us”, and called on the police to protect the right to protest but blamed the violence on “the far left”. The state of emergency allows Spain’s regional governments to order an overnight curfew to run from 11pm to 6am, or to begin and finish an hour earlier or later. The only area of Spain exempt from the curfew is the Canary Islands because of what Sánchez has termed “the very positive epidemiological situation there”. The state of emergency also permits Spain’s regional governments to bring in full or partial lockdowns, and limits public and private gatherings to six people. Spain remains one of the countries in western Europe hardest hit by the virus. By Friday evening, it had recorded 1,185,678 cases and 35,878 deaths.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1469,Starmer: most Labour members would not support Corbyn's EHRC response,11/1/20,"The “vast majority” of Labour members would not have approved of Jeremy Corbyn’s response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s report on antisemitism in the party, Sir Keir Starmer said on Sunday. The new leader also said his predecessor should “reflect” on what he said following the publication of the findings of the EHRC inquiry which found the party responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination. Corbyn was suspended from the party on Thursday after he used his initial response to the EHRC conclusions to suggest that the extent of antisemitism in the party while he was leader had been exaggerated. In an interview on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Starmer refused to be drawn on whether he wanted to see Corbyn readmitted to the party, saying that to answer that would pre-judge the disciplinary process currently underway. But Starmer did say that Corbyn should “reflect” on how he responded to the report when it was published. “I think the vast majority of people in the Labour party and the wider Labour movement think that that was the wrong response and the right response was to honestly accept the findings, apologise, move forward,” Starmer said. Starmer said that in his own response to the EHRC report he had been clear that “those that deny or minimise antisemitism in the Labour party, and say it’s just exaggerated or part of a factional fight, are part of the problem”. Starmer went on: “I was therefore very disappointed in Jeremy’s response where he appeared to suggest it was exaggerated etc.
“I’d invite Jeremy just to reflect on what he said … because I think for most people what they wanted from the Labour party on Thursday was an honest recognition of the problem and of an apology, a line in the sand and a constructive way to move forward, which is what I want for the Labour party.” In his initial response to the report, Corbyn said: “One antisemite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media.” After the announcement of his suspension, which he has said he will “strongly contest”, Corbyn issued a partial clarification, saying that it was wrong to say that Labour did not have a problem with antisemitism, but that he was just making a point about flawed public assumptions about the numbers involved. “It’s … undeniable that a false impression has been created of the number of members accused of antisemitism, as polling shows: that is what has been overstated, not the seriousness of the problem,” Corbyn said. Corbyn was referring to a poll finding in a book about Labour and antisemitism suggesting that people aware of the Labour antisemitism controversy guessed on average that 34% of party members had been the subject of a complaint. Corbyn says the actual figure is 0.3%. Starmer said he had not spoken to Corbyn since the decision was taken to suspend him from the party. He also rejected claims that the decision to suspend Corbyn, which also entails the removal of the party whip in the Commons, would plunge the party into “civil war”. “There is no need for a civil war in the Labour party. I stood on a platform to unite the party and I’m determined to do that, but I also made a solemn pledge that we would root out antisemitism and I’m not going to shirk from difficult decisions in rooting out antisemitism,” Starmer said.",,Politics,Guardian,4

1471,UK industry chief says business needs more from 'thin' Brexit deal,11/1/20,"A business-led campaign to widen a “thin” Brexit deal struck between Britain and the European Union will begin immediately in the new year, it has emerged, amid concerns about the long-term effects on the UK’s economy. In an interview with the Observer, Carolyn Fairbairn, the outgoing director general of the CBI, said that securing a basic deal with the EU should be seen as a “starting point” for a deeper relationship. She warned of a serious effect on Britain’s large services sector, including financial and legal services, as well as engineering. UK government officials remain locked in talks with their Brussels counterparts this weekend, just a fortnight before the deadline identified as the last point at which a deal can be agreed. The main stumbling blocks remain fishing rights and “level playing field” conditions related to state aid. However, even if a deal is signed off, there are grave concerns among British business bodies over the barriers to trade that it will erect. Fairbairn said that any deal would be a “significant improvement” on a no-deal outcome, while the removal of tariffs would be “existential” for the car industry. However, she said her “really big disappointment” was the lack of help for British services in the potential deal, adding that the CBI would immediately fight to broaden the agreement. “Any deal we get now is likely to be focused on goods, and it should be treated as a starting point for a more comprehensive deal in the future,” she said. “At the CBI, we would be doing two things. First of all, we would be looking to help businesses make the most of where we are, to look for the opportunities and to manage that transition. And second, we will be working with the government and supporting the negotiations around building further chapters. [We would like] a services chapter. We’ll need more on aviation. We’ll need more on haulage. Data will be crucial. We hope that there will be a data agreement, but there will be more to do on the back of that. That will be the challenge of the next one to two years. And we will be on that case pretty well immediately. But we need that base case of a foundation deal first.” Some groups have raised serious concerns about the extent of new barriers to trade that will be erected even in the event of a deal. While tariffs will be removed, bureaucracy will increase and both government and industry are braced for issues at the border. A business taskforce to manage the transition has been forged between government and industry in an attempt to smooth the Brexit process in the new year. Looking back on a tumultuous five years in the job, Fairbairn said it had “been a mistake, and a lost opportunity for our country” for businesses not to have had greater involvement in the shape of the deal.
Cash reserves and stockpiling have been run down as a result of the virus, with many businesses assuming the Brexit transition period would simply be extended. “There is some wishful thinking,” Fairbairn said. “The single thing that would be getting businesses preparing best is a deal. Disruption of some sort is likely.” It comes as Boris Johnson is being warned that securing a deal with the EU is the best and easiest way to improve relations with a Joe Biden White House, should the Democratic candidate win this week. Biden has voiced concern that Johnson’s Brexit tactics could affect Northern Ireland’s Good Friday Agreement. Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Britain’s former ambassador to the US who served in Washington between 2007 and 2012, said that a deal was the route through which Johnson could build relations with Biden. “I do think that they need to calculate what the impact of no deal would be, not just on the future relationship over free trade agreements, but more generally, on Britain’s standing with a new Biden administration,” he said. “No deal looks a very lonely position if you’ve got a Biden administration in Washington. “The very strong view among Biden’s team is that Brexit was a strategic mistake of some magnitude. They’ll be wondering how we fill that gap and will have concluded over the past four years that we haven’t really been able to identify a new British role in the world.”",,Politics,Guardian,4
1472,"UK will not import chlorinated chicken from US, ministers say",11/1/20,"The government has finally vowed not to allow chlorinated chicken or hormone-fed beef on British supermarket shelves, defying demands from the US that animal welfare standards be lowered as part of a future trade deal. The international trade secretary, Liz Truss, and the environment minister, George Eustice, have also revealed the government will put the recently established trade and agriculture commission on a statutory footing with a new amendment to the agriculture bill. “We are announcing today that it will be made a statutory body which will give independent advice on trade deals as they go through parliament,” they said in an article in the Mail on Sunday. The move is a significant U-turn for the government, which had rejected Lord Curry’s amendment to the bill to strengthen the commission’s role and legally ban any food that does not meet British import standards post-Brexit.
The commission, on which the National Farmers’ Union and the Food and Drink Federation sit, will now be asked to produce an independent report on the impact on animal welfare and agriculture of each free trade deal the government signs after Brexit. Their recommendations on whether to accept or reject the deal will then be laid in parliament at the start of the 21-day scrutiny period under the terms of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act process. Truss and Eustice also gave the clearest commitment yet to ban US meat from animals not raised to British standards. “Chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef are already banned in the UK, and we will not negotiate to remove that ban in a trade deal,” they said. Donald Trump’s ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, dismissed fears over chlorine washes earlier this year, saying they were the “most effective and economical way to fight food-borne illness”.
He also said last year that the row was presenting the British public with “a false choice”, and that “inflammatory and misleading terms like ‘chlorinated chicken’ and ‘hormone beef’ are deployed to cast American farming in the worst possible light”. The National Farmers’ Union president, Minette Batters, declared the move to put food standards into primary legislation a “landmark moment for the people of the UK, for our countryside and the future of the food on our plates”.
The U-turn over the agriculture bill comes days after Boris Johnson met Batters for a private meeting over food standards. She said the prime minister had responded to the NFU petition, which had been signed by more than a million people, and the campaign by animal welfare experts, environmental charities, politicians and celebrities including Jamie Oliver and Joe Wicks. “It was clear to me how much he personally cares about this issue. I am delighted that he has led the government to draw a line in the sand and commit to the 2019 Conservative manifesto commitment not to undermine our farmers in future trade deals,” she said. The consumer group Which? welcomed the move to make the trade and agriculture commission a statutory body, but said consumers should be directly represented. The government’s food tsar, Henry Dimbleby, has recently said the health sector should also be represented after there was evidence of an increase in consumption of sugary foods in Mexico after a trade deal with the US enabled an advertising blitz by the US confectionary industry.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1473,Union leader says Keir Starmer 'pushing Labour into civil war' over Corbyn suspension,11/1/20,"Keir Starmer was struggling last night to contain an escalating row over Jeremy Corbyn’s suspension from the party following last week’s bombshell report on Labour’s handling of antisemitism in the party. A union leader has accused Starmer of using the issue to pursue a “civil war” within the party, and joined with six other union bosses in issuing a joint statement describing the suspension of Corbyn as “unjust”. The unions’ intervention came as antisemitism campaigners seized on Corbyn’s suspension to warn that the party remains “unsafe” for Jewish members until it thoroughly investigates 15 other MPs about whom they have lodged detailed complaints, including deputy leader Angela Rayner. Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communications Workers Union, said that he believed the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report, which found the party responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination in relation to antisemitism, was “well-balanced”. However, Ward said the decision to suspend Corbyn “reeks of political opportunism”, adding that Starmer had set a bar for suspension that was incompatible with “a fair process”. Labour suspended Corbyn after he claimed that “the scale of the problem” of antisemitism in the party had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media”. But Ward said Starmer had “decided to plunge the Labour party into a civil war of his own making”. “Nothing that Jeremy said warranted his suspension,” Ward said. “It was a well-balanced and factual response to an equally well-balanced report. There isn’t space for one antisemite in the Labour party. But if Labour is actually interested in fighting racism, it needs to do so honestly and not through a damaging factional lens.” Ward added: “Minority groups cannot be used as a battering ram for Labour’s factional war.”
Yesterday, seven trade unions affiliated to Labour, including Unite, Labour’s largest donor, and the TSSA, which backed Starmer in the party leadership election, released a joint statement, reported on the website LabourList, expressing “serious concerns” about Corbyn’s “ill-advised and unjust suspension” and urging the party leadership to “repair this damage”. “As the general secretaries of trade unions affiliated to the Labour party, we seek to put on record our serious concerns about the manner of and rationale for suspension of the former party leader Jeremy Corbyn,” the statement reads. Having suspended Corbyn, Starmer is coming under acute pressure to take more robust action against 15 other Labour MPs about whom the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA), which brought the original complaint that triggered the EHRC investigation, has concerns. The CAA submitted a lengthy dossier to the party about the MPs before Corbyn’s suspension. Now it is calling for swift action against them. “Sir Keir has promised to tear out antisemitism ‘by its roots’,” said Gideon Falter, chief executive of the CAA. “Mr Corbyn was just one of those roots. The 15 other sitting MPs who have indulged in or promoted antisemitic discourse are others. Labour is not safe for Jews until these cases are dealt with under a disciplinary process that is independent, fair, transparent and expeditious. We made the original referral of Labour to the EHRC because the party ignored such cases for so long. We have given Sir Keir until the end of his first year in office to finally address our complaints if he wants Jews to be able to return to Labour.” Labour now faces the highly sensitive task of dealing with Corbyn’s case while investigating the other complaints, in what will be the first major test for David Evans, Labour’s new general secretary.
Fiona Sharpe, spokeswoman for Labour Against Antisemitism (LAAS), said it was clear that Labour’s processes had not been “fit for purpose” and called for a wider, independent review into hundreds of antisemitism complaints. “Over this period, LAAS reported hundreds of apparent party members, providing evidence of Holocaust denial, the use of racially pejorative language, threats of violence and a variety of antisemitic tropes,” she said. “Due to Labour’s appalling mismanagement, many of these members are still active in the party: at local meetings, on councils and even in parliament.” The shadow business minister, Lucy Powell, said that the Labour party would recover from the damning report. “I am sure we will move on as one united party at what is a very very critical time for our country and for people’s lives and livelihoods,” she told BBC Breakfast.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1474,Welsh and Scottish leaders hit out at 'unfair' furlough extension,11/1/20,"The Welsh and Scottish governments have hit back at the “unfair” extension of the furlough scheme during England’s second lockdown, weeks after the devolved nations called for the measure to support their own tightened restrictions. By Sunday evening, both the Scottish government and the leader of the Scottish Conservatives found themselves at odds with the Treasury, as it appeared that the scheme would only be available to the devolved nations for the duration of an English lockdown. The finance secretary, Kate Forbes, said: “Despite discussions today, the UK Treasury continue to deny our request that full furlough at 80% be made available for businesses and employees in Scotland at any point we need it, suggesting that it is only available for the duration of a lockdown in England.” Earlier in the day the Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, insisted the UK government “must treat Scotland the same way as England”. Ross called for No 10 to commit to restarting furlough if a Scottish national lockdown becomes necessary, ahead of a keynote speech to the Policy Exchange thinktank on Monday, saying the guarantee “has to be made immediately”. Forbes said that she had requested further urgent talks with Treasury ministers after receiving “no clarity” on related questions about payments for business support and whether Holyrood will receive additional Barnett consequentials as a result of increased UK support for English local government. Echoing the Scottish government’s concerns, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said that extending furlough midway through his country’s “firebreak” measures was “not fair at all”. Drakeford told BBC Radio Cymru that the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had rejected his requests to increase subsidies for wages when Wales went back into lockdown. “I got an answer quickly to say that was not possible for a number of technical reasons and so, no. Now when things change in England, they change their minds about the furlough plan. And that’s not fair.” Drakeford later held a meeting of the Welsh cabinet to discuss the impact of the new English measures and said that he would provide more details at Monday’s regular press conference. Speaking on the BBC’s Sunday Politics Scotland, the Scottish deputy first minister, John Swinney, said that Westminster had disregarded the issues faced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland when the devolved nations asked for a similar extension several weeks ago.
The latest criticisms reflect ongoing tensions between Westminster and the devolved nations, with Welsh and Scottish first ministers earlier this autumn accusing Boris Johnson of failing to speak to them directly about the possibility of a new national lockdown in England. A Treasury spokesperson said Ross was “right that this crisis has underlined the importance of the union”. “Our extension of the furlough scheme until December is just one part of our £200bn support package, which has protected jobs and helped millions of people across the UK continue to provide for their families. “As we have throughout this crisis, we will continue to listen and respond to people’s concerns as the situation demands.” Speaking on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said he would have preferred to see a four-nations approach to a second lockdown.
While Johnson has faced heavy criticism for his delay in introducing a second lockdown, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have tightened their own restrictions in recent weeks. Wales introduced a two-week firebreak – coinciding with school half-term, and under which shops, pubs and hotels closed and citizens were told to stay at home – from 23 October, to last until 9 November. Two weeks earlier, Scotland introduced a similar two-week “circuit breaker” around the school half-term. Sturgeon announced a nationwide ban on drinking indoors in pubs, bars and restaurants across Scotland, and a full shutdown of all licensed premises across the central belt, where infection rates are accelerating most rapidly. Schools and early years childcare remain open and a new five-level system of Covid controls comes into force on Monday.
In Northern Ireland, pubs and restaurants were closed for four weeks starting on 16 October with the exception of takeaways and deliveries. Schools were closed for two weeks from 19 October. Speaking to BBC Scotland, Swinney said that while he could not categorically rule out a national lockdown in the future, the Scottish government had confidence in its own level system, under which the majority of Scots will live under level 3, which bans indoor socialising and drinking in pubs and restaurants along with travel between local authorities. Swinney also said that, while there are significant differences in levels of coronavirus in Scotland in general compared with England, there are also significant differences within the country, for example between the Highlands and islands and west-central Scotland.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1475,What can we learn about 2020 from the Black Death? Dorsey Armstrong has all the answers,11/1/20,"A pandemic rages across the globe, leaving a trail of death, confusion and economic ruin, and changing everything. This is a new disease, about which little is understood. People and communities don’t know what to do, and they react in different ways – sensibly, understandably, honourably, idiotically, criminally. Cities go into lockdown, quarantine rules are introduced, new hospitals are built to try to cope with the numbers of sick. There are heroes and acts of kindness and selflessness. There are also deniers, conspiracy theorists, finger pointers. And there are people – including those in positions of leadership and power – who don’t just fail to step up to the plate, but abandon the field of play. The year is 1348, of course. Not 2020, but you knew that. Different deals: Covid is a virus; the Black Death – the Great Mortality, pestilence, plague – a flea-driven bacterial infection. Now (it still exists) plague is mostly treatable with antibiotics; then, of course, it lived up to its names. “The thing I like to stress to people feeling anxious about Covid is that the mortality rate for the Black Death in the 14th century was about 80%,” says Dorsey Armstrong. With Covid it is far, far lower, “although I understand absolutely it’s not encouraging to people with family members who have gotten ill and who have died”. Armstrong, 49, is a professor of English and medieval literature at Purdue University in Indiana. She did a series of TV lectures – The Black Death: The World’s Most Devastating Plague – that became an unlikely hit. Made in 2016, way before Covid, it went out on Amazon Prime this year, just as the new pandemic struck and locked-down 21st-century humans looked to the distant past to try to understand what was happening and what may happen next.
We meet the modern way, on Zoom. She is sitting at her desk at home in West Lafayette, Indiana, in front of busy bookshelves. No plague kitsch on display, sadly. In the series she charts the spread of the Black Death across Eurasia from a panelled room decorated with skulls and rats. Standing on an oriental rug and wearing a series of brightly coloured jackets (chosen by her mum), she alternates her angle of delivery as if addressing students on different flanks of a lecture hall. The lessons are scholarly but lively, compelling and human; as likely to reference The Walking Dead as Giovanni Boccaccio’s The Decameron. And she serves them up with relish and a wry wit. So the mass graves of medieval Florence were dug deep, then filled with a layer of bodies, followed by a thin layer of earth, then more bodies, “like how one layers lasagne with cheese”. It has been an intense few months for Armstrong. Four family members – her parents, her brother and her sister – got Covid-19. All have recovered, though her mother was hospitalised for several weeks and still suffers from exhaustion. Armstrong’s 14-year-old twin daughters have been at home all day, off school. One, who has autism and for whom school was stressful, “likes to tell us that she is having a great coronavirus … For the other, the lack of social contact is really difficult.” At the same time there has been this explosion of interest in her Black Death course, though she stresses she would “prefer that the course languished in oblivion rather than there be Covid-19 sparking an interest in it”. Different diseases, different times, but a lot of human nature spans the centuries and Armstrong immediately saw parallels. “The thing that is most horrifying about studying the Black Death is that, in the terror, people were looking for anyone to blame,” she says. “These conspiracy theories start to circulate about Jewish populations, that this was a Jewish conspiracy and that Jews were poisoning wells and planned to wipe out medieval Christian society, which of course was absolutely not true. When Covid first erupted we saw, to my distress, scapegoating of people of Asian ancestry because it looked as if the virus had originated in China.” It didn’t help that the US president called it the “China virus” and “kung flu”. She’s not a fan. When it was clear the Black Death was wiping out whole communities, some turned to God, prayer, even self-flagellation. Others thought, if we are going to go, let’s have a good time. Armstrong hasn’t noticed any whippings today, but the partying is going on. “We see that quite a bit with college campuses where students – 18 to 22 years old, prefrontal cortex not fully developed – have decided they are going to have a good time.” A loss of confidence in leaders – political, religious – is another parallel. Also deurbanisation. Armstrong witnessed well-to-do New Yorkers heading to their second homes out of town when the city was hit hard in the summer. In Florence – which kind of was the New York of the 14th century – “rich Florentines fled to the countryside to try to avoid the Black Death while the city was suffering”. Then, once everyone had left, the city fathers started dishing out fines, telling people they had to come back to do their jobs. Not unlike essential workers being called back to work today.
I wonder what connection she sees between Covid and the recent protest and unrest in her country, with people calling for a radical change to deeply entrenched inequalities? “It’s not that the pandemic contributes to social unrest, it is that the pandemic allows other systemic problems in society to become more visible. They cannot be controlled or contained or dismissed or covered up because the systems that were in place to maintain a status quo are too busy coping with this other emergency.” She brings up the serfs in medieval England who were suddenly enabled to tell the lord of the manor they didn’t need to stay with him, instead they could head off down the road where people were desperately needed to work the land, and actually charge wages. “In some places, people who had been at the bottom of the social order were able to carve out a better situation for themselves – if they survived the plague.” This sounds like good news. And though the same feudal agrarian system no longer exists, even in the US midwest where Armstrong lives, perhaps opportunity for social mobility may emerge from this? “This situation has made plain that the system, especially in the US, is fatally flawed and that there are no safety nets. For the first time I hope that we will begin a conversation about universal basic income. And it’s made clear that if you connect health insurance to employment you are going to have a disaster if people lose their jobs because businesses have shut down. I hope we are going to have another conversation about universal health care in this country.” Scholars have often said that medieval European society would have continued being medieval for longer had it not been for the Black Death. Also that it sowed the seeds that led to the Reformation and the Renaissance. And while Armstrong doesn’t dispute these positive changes, she points out that it took time for them to register. “It’s not, once we make it through, all sunshine and rainbows, but there is hope for improvement in society.”
More than a post-Covid new Renaissance, she would like to see a fundamental step backwards to shore up the foundations of society. “It would be great if we get some great literature out of this,” she says. But what she really wants to see is “communal and systemic structures in place that support people that we don’t currently have”. She looks back to Florence – I think Armstrong likes Florence – which set up the first board of health after the first wave of plague. It’s going to be easier for the historians of the future; there is so much more documentation. “In the case of the Black Death, sometimes you don’t have information,” she says. “What we have that shows the devastation is a lack of information – bureaucratic documents that suddenly cease being continued, or a sudden silence some place because there is no one left to document what happened. Or an increase in people writing wills.” She is in no doubt that our times will be studied, in detail; not just the 21st century, they will be zooming in much closer. “Someone will say: ‘So, what’s your field of study?’ and they’ll say: ‘Well, I do the mid-portion of 2020, I focus on March through July.’ Another will say: ‘I focus on the second half of the year.’ Because this year has been so unusual in the way it has affected all levels of society and everyone around the world.” If more people knew about the Black Death, she thinks, things could have been different. “If people had understood the devastation plague had wrought on the medieval world, going into the current pandemic, I think more people would have taken steps to curb the spread of Covid a little earlier.” She’s not suggesting that Donald Trump wasn’t up on his medieval history, is she? “Or with what is happening right now. Or reality.” And she rattles off the list of failures – delayed lockdown, not enough adequate PPE or accurate test and tracing, no coordinated national plan – that could so easily also be applied to this country. Oh, go on, give him a score, it’s part of your job. Student Trump, out of 10? “Minus 20.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1476,What the Covid lockdown in England means for consumers,11/1/20,"Which shops will remain open? As with the last lockdown, food shops, supermarkets, chemists and certain other retailers providing “essential goods and services” will be allowed to remain open. Downing Street said on Sunday it would set out exactly which shops will be allowed to stay open in the coming days. Expect bike shops, off-licences and wine merchants to get the green light. The government has indicated that garden centres will remain open, in which case DIY stores might be allowed to keep their doors open, too.
So what’s closing? Virtually everything else. All non-essential retailers must close on Wednesday night, as must all pubs, cafes, and restaurants. All indoor and outdoor leisure facilities such as bowling alleys, leisure centres, gyms, swimming pools, golf courses and kids’ soft-play areas must all close. It is the same story for all entertainment venues, meaning all theatres, concert halls, cinemas, museums, galleries and bingo halls have to shut, as must all hairdressers and other personal care outlets. What about takeaways? While restaurants, bars and pubs must close to the public, they will still be allowed to provide takeaway and delivery services. One crucial difference this time around is that the government has said pubs will not be allowed to sell alcohol on a takeaway basis. During the last lockdown, otherwise closed pubs were able to sell off their beer stocks, which helped keep many going. Unless the government reverses this decision in the next 48 hours, expect some very unhappy publicans who will have to throw away a lot of perfectly good beer. I have a short-break booked in the UK in November – will I get a refund? The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has previously stated that refunds should be paid to customers who cannot take up a service because of government regulations. Despite this, some consumers are expected to lose out. For example, Airbnb is at odds with CMA’s stance. It has stated that its standard cancellation terms will apply to all bookings made after March, meaning that some people will lose up to half their money. The company keeps its booking fee if the consumer cancels. Better to let the host cancel, in which case you are entitled to a full refund. I was due to travel abroad – what happens to me? After the Canary Islands were added to the no-quarantine list last week, bookings went mad for November as people tried to grab some last-minute sun. If you are due to fly before Wednesday night, you can still go. Trips that were due to depart from Thursday onwards are off, and whether you receive a refund will depend on how you booked the trip. Those who booked a package tour will have that trip cancelled and will be entitled to a full refund under the package tour regulations. If you booked your own flight and accommodation, it is looking far less certain. If your flight is cancelled by the airline you can ask for a refund. Few travel insurance policies are paying out for the cancellation of trips booked after mid-March, when the coronavirus pandemic became a “known event”. My employer is going to shut again – can I be furloughed again? Yes. The furlough scheme was due to be replaced by the far less generous job support scheme (JSS) on Sunday, 1 November. However, the furlough scheme, which has paid up to 80% of the wages – up to £2,500 a month – for more 10 million people prevented from working because of Covid restrictions, will now run until December – when this new lockdown is expected to come to an end. From the employees’ perspective it will be identical to the scheme launched back in March. For employers, it is significantly more generous. In recent months, the government has been paying 60% of the employee’s payments leaving the company to contribute the remaining 20% of the furlough payments. Now, the chancellor is picking up the full 80%, leaving the employer to cover pension and national insurance contributions. To be eligible for the extension, employees must have been on the payroll on 30 October 2020.
What else can firms get? The government will also give England-based firms up to £3,000 a month under the local restrictions support grant if their premises is forced to close. They can also apply for £1,000 for every furloughed employee kept on until at least the end of January, or £1,500 for each unemployed 16- to 24-year-old given a ‘‘high-quality’’ work placement for at least six months.
What other help is there for workers struggling to pay the bills? The government’s mortgage payments holiday scheme, which has allowed householders a six month payments deferral, was due to end on Saturday, 31 October, but this is being extended as well. The Treasury says borrowers who have been impacted by coronavirus are entitled to a six-month mortgage payments holiday without this being recorded on their credit file. The Financial Conduct Authority will announce further information on how the extension will practically work on Monday. Since the start of the pandemic, lenders have granted a total of £2.5m mortgage payment holidays.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1477,What you can and can't do in England's new Covid lockdown,11/1/20,"Boris Johnson has announced a four-week lockdown in England, after weeks of pressure from his scientific advisers and opposition parties to introduce tougher measures to tackle coronavirus. The full details of the restrictions will be published early this week before a vote in parliament on Wednesday. This is what we know so far. How long will England’s second lockdown last? The national restrictions are due to come into effect on Thursday, after MPs vote on them on Wednesday, and remain in place at least until 2 December. After that, national measures are to be replaced with the current tiered system of restrictions linked to a region’s infection rate. But it is possible that the national lockdown could be extended if the R value does not drop significantly, the cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, conceded on Sunday. Ministers hope the new measures will contain the spread of Covid-19, but so far the virus has outstripped the scientists’ “worst-case scenarios”. Any extension of the lockdown beyond 2 December will require a vote by MPs, Downing Street has said. What can I leave home for? While the prime minister is keen to stress the new restrictions do not amount to a lockdown of the kind the country faced in March, they are still stringent. People can leave home only for limited reasons, including: For childcare or education, where it is not provided online. To go to work unless it can be done from home. Outdoor exercise either with household members or with one person from another household. For all medical reasons and appointments. To escape injury or harm, such as domestic abuse. To provide care for vulnerable people or volunteer. To shop for food and essentials. To see people in your support bubble. Children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated. This list is not exhaustive and other permitted reasons for leaving home may be set out this week when the legislation is published. People could face fines from police for leaving their home without a legally permitted excuse. So far, however, forces have been reluctant to enforce the regulations aggressively.
Can different households mix indoors? No, not unless they are part of an “exclusive” support bubble, which allows a single-person household to meet and socialise with another household. Parents are allowed to form a childcare bubble with another household for the purposes of informal childcare, where the child is 13 or under. Can different households mix outdoors? People are allowed to meet one person from another household socially and for exercise in outdoor public spaces, which does not include private gardens. The health minister, Nadine Dorries, has said children under school age, as well as children and adults dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, will not count towards the limit of two people meeting outside. “This will mean that a parent can see a family member with their baby or young children,” Dorries tweeted, who added that official guidance will be updated to reflect this. Can I attend funerals, weddings or religious services? Up to 30 people will still be allowed to attend funerals, while stone settings and ash scatterings can continue with up to 15 guests. Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies are not permitted except in “exceptional circumstances”. Places of worship must remain closed except for voluntary services, individual prayer and other exempt activities. Can I travel abroad for a holiday? Most outbound international travel will be banned. There is no exemption for staying away from home for a holiday. This means people cannot travel internationally or within the UK, unless for work, education or other legally permitted exemptions. Overnight stays away from primary residences will not be allowed, except for specific exceptions including for work.
Should some people be shielding? The prime minister said the clinically vulnerable or those aged over 60 should be especially careful and minimise contacts, but there would be no return to the shielding programme used in the first lockdown. Johnson said those in this category should work from home. Which businesses will close? Everything except essential shops and education settings, which include nurseries, schools and universities, will close. Entertainment venues will also have to close. Pubs, restaurants and indoor and outdoor leisure facilities will have to close their doors once more. However, takeaway and delivery services will still be allowed, while construction and manufacturing will stay open. However, pubs will not be able to sell takeaway alcohol, even though alcohol can be bought from supermarkets and other shops. Parents will still be able to access some registered childcare and other childcare activities, and they are able to form a childcare bubble with another household for the purposes of informal childcare, where the child is 13 or under. Some youth services may be able to continue, such as one-to-one work, but most clubs will need to close their doors. Public services, such as jobcentres, courts, and civil registration offices will remain open. There is no exemption for grassroots organised team sports.

1496,An army marches on its stomach': the food vendors sustaining Thai protesters,11/2/20,"In Thailand, wherever protests erupt, food is never far. Beyond the crowds of mostly young demonstrators who rallied across the country in recent months to call for democratic reforms, food vendors can be seen lining the streets, grilling rows of fish balls, pork balls, and frying chicken. Strings of plump sausages are draped over mobile carts, ready for hungry demonstrators who join rallies after school or work. Sellers are stocked with everything from crispy rolled pancakes to coconut ice-cream and bags of pickled mango. Even when gatherings were banned last month, prompting a cat-and-mouse game between protesters and the police, food vendors were first on the scene. Sellers were stationed in prime positions before journalists, the authorities and even many demonstrators arrived. For food sellers, the escalating protest movement – which has surprised many with calls to reform the monarchy – is a welcome business opportunity. Demonstrations have taken place up and down the country, drawing crowds of tens of thousands in Bangkok.
Toey, 25, who preferred not to give her full name, was among those selling to crowds on Thursday evening in the capital, where thousands gathered for a protest targeting royal spending. Demonstrators held a mock fashion show parodying Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana, one of the king’s daughters, who has launched a new fashion collection. At Toey’s stall, lines of soft, steamed buns oozed chocolate, bright strawberry filling and green pandan custard. During the coronavirus lockdown earlier in the year, she struggled to find customers, but the footfall at demonstrations has been a significant boost. “Usually I could earn 1,500 baht [£37.20] a day, but during the protest, I earned 4,000-5,000 baht a day. The protests actually help me a lot,” she says. Wae, 46, who is selling grilled Isan sausage, studies the news and asks her daughter to check Facebook so that she can find the right spot to attract customers. Isan sausage, made from fermented pork and rice, is a bestseller, she says, because it’s easy to eat on the move. It is crunchy, with a sour taste, and can be served with chilli, raw cabbage or a slice of ginger. “Today I prepared a bit more, so hopefully I can sell it all,” she says. She plans to sell at counter-rallies held by royalists, as well, she says, but is not sure the business will be as good. Protesters there are mostly older people, and fewer in number. Wae agrees with some of the protesters’ demands, but not calls for reform of the monarchy – which is protected by strict laws and, according to the constitution, is “enthroned in a position of revered worship”.
Other vendors are more supportive. Kaesinee Chanthanontri, 32, says she backs all calls made by the protesters – including for prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to stand down, for a new constitution and for an accountable royal family. “I think to reform something, it will make that thing better. We are all under constitution so if we reform it, it will make our lives better,” she says. “I think Thai people should have freedom of speech,” agrees Toey. Pin, 23, a graphic designer who arrived at the protest after work, says most sellers support the demonstrators, and are generous with portions. “When I buy something from the vendor, they always give us a little more,” she says, while motorbike taxis have offered free rides for short distances. Drivers have also acted as lookouts, giving early warning signs when riot police approached to break up a previous demonstration that was held in defiance of a ban on gatherings. Prayuth, a former army general who first came to power in the 2014 coup, has since dropped the measures banning protests, but he has rejected protesters’ demands that he stand down, and has told them not to discuss the monarchy. On Sunday King Maha Vajiralongkorn was stopped by Channel 4 news and CNN while walking among royalists. “We love them all the same,” he said of the demonstrators, in the rare interview. Asked if there was room to compromise with protesters, the king replied, “Thailand is the land of compromise,” and quickly turned to walk away. Activists are unconvinced. They point out that dozens of people have been arrested for taking part in recent protests – including on charges such as sedition and under a rarely used law that covers violence against the queen. The latter, used after the queen’s motorcade was heckled, carries a possible death sentence. Water cannon was also recently used on a crowd of demonstrators that included school students. Even protesters who believe reform is possible say it will be a long journey. Aek, 43, who came straight from work, is demonstrating because he wants Prayuth out. “An army marches on its stomach,” he says, pausing to buy bread with strawberry filling.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1497,Bittersweet': reopened Cyprus resort highlights deepening divides across eastern Mediterranean,11/2/20,"Pavlos Iakovou was 17 when he met his wife, Tuolla, at the Edelweiss cafe in Famagusta, the fashionable Cypriot holiday resort where his family owned a hotel. Last week, the couple returned to some of their old haunts in the abandoned quarter of Varosha, or Maraş in Turkish, for the first time in 46 years. Sealed off as a militarised zone and untouched since 1974, when Turkey invaded following a Greek coup, the decaying slice of 1970s glamour is now open again to visitors – Greek Cypriots included. People on both sides of the island have long wanted Varosha restored to its former glory. The circumstances under which the area has been reopened, however, point to a changing political climate on Cyprus, as well as the wider eastern Mediterranean, as Turkey plays its cards in the battle with Cyprus and Greece over oil and gas reserves. “When we left in 1974 we thought we’d be gone for two or three days at the most,” Iakovou said. “This is a bittersweet experience. We always refused to sell the hotel and now I can visit it. But now I don’t think we are ever going to have a solution to reunite the island.” On 29 October, a holiday to celebrate the founding of modern Turkey, tourists from the country thronged Varosha’s streets, taking pictures in front of hotels and restaurants once favoured by Elizabeth Taylor and Brigitte Bardot but now crumbling into the sparkling water. A handful of Varosha’s main roads and 200 metres of beachfront were opened to the public in October in an election stunt that helped Ankara’s preferred candidate, the rightwinger Ersin Tatar, win the presidential election in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus.
A runoff after poor voter turnout in the first round between 11 candidates resulted in the surprise pivot towards closer relations with Turkey and a two-state solution, rather than a future federal Cyprus favoured by most of the other parties. Tatar’s victory was partly due to Turkish Cypriot frustration with the stagnating peace process and decades of international isolation, as well as the growing number of conservative-leaning settlers from the mainland. But as Turkey’s belligerent and emboldened president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, ramps up efforts to adjust a regional status quo perceived in Turkey as historically unfair, the result of northern Cyprus’s presidential election – in which opposition parties say Ankara played a decisive hand – has taken on new international significance. Cyprus, the confluence of the competing political and eastern Mediterranean oil and gas exploration claims between Athens, Nicosia and Turkey, is fast emerging as a focal point of a new and potentially dangerous reality. “We had put forward careful plans to reopen Varosha in a way that is considerate of the needs of former inhabitants, in line with international law and keeps the international community informed of what’s going on, but the way this was done was terrible … for the sake of Mr Tatar’s election campaign,” said northern Cyprus’s foreign minister, Kudret Özersay, who also serves as leader of the People’s party, at his office in Nicosia. His party, the junior member of the governing coalition, withdrew in protest at the move in the run-up to the election, bringing down the then prime minister Tatar’s cabinet – a development that could result in early parliamentary elections next year. “This is a turning point for north Cyprus, especially if Turkish involvement compromises our democratic process like this again,” he added. “I think this suggests that a large crisis, the fight for hydrocarbon reserves, is on its way. Which actors will be part of that process, and whether we will end up negotiating over it or fighting over it, is yet to be determined. But I fear a real crisis is coming if the involvement of the Turkish Cypriot authorities is excluded. It is for the benefit of all to respect the democratic will of the Turkish Cypriot people.”
Ankara is unlikely to be able to take advantage of oil and gas reserves found in what is considered internationally as Greek waters without triggering a response from Athens. The north Cyprus axis, however, which may not necessarily be militarily defended by Greece, may offer easier pickings. The competition for hydrocarbon reserves has been building over the last decade. To this day Greece has not begun any official operations to explore natural resources in the Aegean, in the knowledge that to do so would lead to competing claims from Turkey. The republic of Cyprus, however, began offering plots for exploration to foreign companies in 2011. Last year, northern Cyprus suggested that the Greek and Turkish administrations on the island should cooperate over oil drilling activities and share revenue. The Greek Cypriot government also rejected a proposal from Ankara for all sides to cease exploration until a peace settlement was reached, on the grounds it contravened international law. Since then the relationships between Cyprus and Turkey, as well as Greece and Turkey, have deteriorated to the lowest ebb in decades, even leading observers to fear direct naval clashes between the two Nato allies. The escalating tensions have drawn in several Mediterranean neighbours, as well as the United Arab Emirates and France. At the end of last year Turkey signed a maritime boundary agreement with the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya, which effectively ignored the existence of the Greek island of Crete, prompting Greece, Cyprus, Israel, Egypt, Italy, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority to form the rival EastMed Gas Forum. Since the summer, the presence of the Turkish seismic research vessel Oruç Reis off the coasts of Cyprus and the Greek island of Kastellorizo accompanied by Turkish warships has put the Greek navy on alert. France – which opposes Turkey and the GNA in Libya – has also deployed two Rafale fighter jets and a naval frigate to the eastern Mediterranean in an attempt to deter Turkey. The EU will next reconsider sanctions against Ankara over its hydrocarbon exploration efforts in December, but for now several plates are still spinning. Tatar is due to meet with the Greek Cypriot leader, Nicos Anastasiades, for the first time in his new role on Monday, which should set the tone for relations between the two sides in the future. Erdoğan himself is due to visit Nicosia and Varosha on 15 November, the anniversary of the declaration of the self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, in a message supposed to convey strength to both his domestic and international audiences. Whether the abandoned city can truly rise from the ashes is not yet clear: the continued absence of a settlement and complex property rights and compensation logistics stand in the way. Taking selfies in front of the trees and vines that have engulfed the King George hotel, Süleyman Ergen, who moved from Hatay to work as a delivery driver in Nicosia five years ago, was confident those obstacles could be overcome. “This is Turkey’s destiny. This is where Turkey will have a new beginning,” he said.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1498,Allies turned adversaries: Samoa’s former deputy PM to challenge her former leader,11/2/20,"Samoa’s former deputy prime minister will run against her former party of 35 years, and the prime minister she served under, when she contests next year’s election as an independent candidate. The most prominent and powerful female politician in Samoa’s independent history, and the daughter of the country’s first prime minister, Fiame Naomi Mata’afa quit as deputy prime minister and as a member of the government last month. It also meant she left the Human Rights Protection party (HRPP) of which she had been a member of since 1985. Her extraordinary departure is part of a broader rebuke to the rule of prime minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi, the third-longest serving prime minister in the world, but who faces a burgeoning challenge to his 22-year rule, over new laws his critics say undermine the constitution and entrench a growing authoritarianism in the country.
Fiame appears certain to be returned to parliament. With nominations now closed, she is unopposed in her seat of Lotofaga, and has not ruled out joining – even leading – a new coalition of three opposition parties challenging the ruling HRPP. Asked if she would accept a leadership role in the nascent Fa’atuatua i Le Atua Samoa ua Tasi (FAST) party after the election in April, she told the Guardian: “I would take it, yes of course.” The elder statesman of Pacific politics, Malielegaoi has been prime minister and foreign minister of Samoa since 1998. But his decision this year to introduce three bills - the constitution amendment bill, judicature bill, and the lands and titles bill - have coalesced previously disparate political forces against him.
Legal experts say the new laws would undermine Samoa’s constitution, judicial independence, and the rule of law, with significant implications for human rights. The amendments would reshape Samoa’s courts by elevating the lands and titles court (LTC) into a stand-alone judiciary equal in standing to the supreme court. Proponents of the laws say they are designed to elevate Samoan custom in the country’s justice system, which they argue is dominated by palagi – foreign – legalistic perspective. But the Samoa Law Society argues creating a second judicial branch is undemocratic. “In the past, certain actions claimed to be taken on behalf of the community, such as beatings or house burnings, have been declared by the supreme court to violate fundamental rights. The removal of supreme court oversight of the LTC would effectively leave village fono with decision-making power unfettered by human rights considerations.” Speaking to the Guardian from her home in Matautu, Fiame, whose father helped frame Samoa’s constitution, said: “Once I understood the impact of these laws, it was very clear in my mind that I could not support it and I could not remain in the party. It was not a difficult decision for me to make”. “Creating these kinds of legislations that are taking us away from the rule of law, is a classic example of the level of power that the HRPP now has: it feels like it can do anything.” HRPP has ruled Samoa since 1982, without serious challenge from other parties. It currently holds a supermajority in parliament.
Fiame said decades of single-party rule was not healthy for a democracy. “Essentially it gives them licence to do what they like and to do what is not lawful, or even more seriously to dismantle the legal foundation upon which our country is based upon.”
In a statement Malielegaoi has accused Fiame of using her departure as leverage for her political future, saying she split with the party “not for professional reasons but personal reasons”. And he said he was unaffected by the new political force in his country, telling the Samoa Observer: “May they live well and grow well. Parties such as these do not take long until they break apart and disperse.” The prime minister is being challenged in his seat by two chiefs in next April’s elections, but remains confident in his own, and his party’s chances. And he remains personally popular in the country, and carries a chiefly authority. When a gang of drunken youths refused to stop throwing stones at a circus tent in Apia last month, and police failed to show, the prime minister intervened and broke the group up. Veteran journalist and political commentator Mataelina Pio Sioa, editor of Samoa Newsline newspaper, told the Guardian while there were criticisms of Malielegaoi’s leadership and concerns he was a “one man-band” leading Samoa, his party retained, at village level, immense grassroots support. “At the end of the day, HRPP still has the most popular candidates in the villages and constituencies, and those are the numbers that count.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1499,"At least 54 killed in Ethiopia massacre, says Amnesty",11/2/20,"At least 54 people were killed in a rebel attack in Ethiopia’s restive Oromia region at the weekend, according to Amnesty International. Survivors of the massacre counted 54 bodies in a schoolyard in the village of Gawa Qanqa, which was targeted late on Sunday by suspected members of the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA). Most of the victims were women and children and elderly people, according to survivors who hid in nearby forests. The incident is likely to ramp up pressure on the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, winner of last year’s Nobel peace prize, to improve security in a country struggling with ethnic violence. The violence occurred in an area of western Ethiopia known as Wollega and involved up to 60 armed and unarmed assailants, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said. It said the assailants targeted members of the Amhara ethnic group, Ethiopia’s second largest, and victims “were dragged from their homes and taken to a school, where they were killed”. The EHRC said: “Official figures state a death toll of 32 civilians, but preliminary evidence obtained by the EHRC indicate the number is very likely to exceed that tally.” Earlier on Monday, the Oromia regional government said the perpetrators belonged to the OLA, a group blamed for kidnappings and bomb attacks in western and southern Ethiopia. A survivor from Wollega said the violence erupted after security forces stationed in the area abruptly and inexplicably left, allowing OLA fighters to round up civilians. “After collecting us, they opened fire on us, and then afterwards looted cattle and burned down houses,” said the survivor, who spoke on condition of anonymity for safety reasons. “I have counted more than 50 corpses, and I know there were others hit by bullets.” The EHRC called on authorities to investigate why the military withdrew from the area. “These gruesome killings of civilians are unconscionable and flout basic principles of humanity,” said Daniel Bekele, the head of the commission. “No amount of grievance can justify such brutality, and perpetrators should be held to account.” The OLA, believed to number in the low thousands, broke off from the Oromo Liberation Front, an opposition party that spent years in exile but was allowed to return to Ethiopia after Abiy took office in 2018. Separate attacks on Amhara civilians have recently been reported in two other regions. Authorities last week barred the National Movement of Amhara (Nama), an opposition party, from staging demonstrations denouncing the killing of Amhara civilians. Dessalegn Chanie, a senior member of Nama, said “up to 200 Amharas were ruthlessly murdered” in the attack on Sunday, though he acknowledged the precise toll was difficult to pin down. “According to survivors from the area whom I talked to earlier today, they are not sure about the count of deaths because they just ran [into the forest],” he said. Abiy said security forces had been deployed to the area and were “undertaking measures” to restore order.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1500,"Australiaâ€™s economic dependency on China 'will not change', says former ambassador to Beijing",11/2/20,"Australia is likely to keep suffering economic harm from “repeated rounds of Chinese economic coercion” and needs to find a way to reset the relationship, a former ambassador to Beijing has warned. Seafood exporters are the latest industry group to report disruptions in accessing the Chinese market and Geoff Raby, the Australian ambassador to China from 2007 to 2011, said Australia needed China more than the other way around. Raby, in an interview with Guardian Australia, argued that Australia had joined itself at the hip with the United States over the past few years in seeking to resist China’s rise – an approach he believed went against Australia’s interests. That is despite the Morrison government’s assertions – including at high-level talks in Washington in July – that Canberra is pursuing its own policy and is not doing anything to injure the important relationship with Beijing. In a new book published on Tuesday, Raby suggests Australia’s strategy for managing the rise of China has been “incremental, reactive to others’ agendas, and as such, incoherent”.
He also says talk about Australia significantly diversifying its economic relationship with China by turning to other markets is “nothing other than wishful thinking”. The complementarities between the two economies “are so profound that Australia’s economic dependency on China will not change” unless Australians choose to accept a major cut in their living standards, according to the book, China’s Grand Strategy and Australia’s Future in the New Global Order. “Canberra hates this, but I start with the premise that it’s an asymmetrical relationship [and] whether we like it or not, we need China more than they need us,” Raby, who is also a former Australian ambassador to the World Trade Organization, said in the interview. “It’s not a question of who’s right or wrong. Diplomacy and pragmatic foreign policy should be about getting outcomes and results that are in your interests.” The Australian government has said it will not bow to economic pressure and is seeking to stand up for its values. Raby questioned whether Australia’s interests were best served by the current situation “where we have exposed ourselves to repeated rounds of Chinese economic coercion”. He said while Australia should reject China’s economic coercion “that doesn’t mean they’re not going to keep doing it to us and we’re not going to keep paying the price”. On Monday, the Morrison government called on Beijing to provide certainty to Australian rock lobster exporters, after several shipments were held up by customs authorities for further testing over the weekend. The Seafood Trade Advisory Group, which represents seafood exporters on trade and market access issues, said there were positive signs on Monday “with the Chinese authorities undertaking additional testing over the weekend and confirmation that delayed consignments are starting to clear customs”. The delays had fuelled fears that seafood could be the next Australian sector affected by trade tensions with China after barley, beef, cotton, coal and wine were all targeted by official or undeclared trade actions. While it is difficult to quantify the cost of the trade war, Perth USAsia Centre research shared with Guardian Australia last week showed the total annual value of exports to China in the five industries affected by declared and undeclared sanctions was $19bn. An additional $28bn worth of services exports could be at risk if Beijing’s warnings to its citizens against travel to Australia – based on claims of an elevated risk of racist attacks – prevents a post-Covid recovery in tourism and international education. Raby likened the Australian government’s approach to the Black Knight, the hapless character from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. “The Black Knight’s got his arms and legs chopped off and he yells ‘Come back you chicken’. We’re a bit like that. And I’m just calling for pragmatic, realist policy.” Australia needed to think about how it could offer a circuit breaker without selling out its interests, Raby said. “It needs to be about changing the conversation with China,” he said. “Things that matter most to Beijing, I’d argue from a country like Australia, is recognising China’s territorial integrity, the legitimacy of the Communist party as the governing party of China and China’s ascendancy as a major power in the region and one that needs to be respected for that.” In the book, Raby contends that recognition of China’s interests and its party-state are required for Australia to seek opportunities to engage with Beijing on issues such as the environment, water resources, energy, terrorism, transnational crime, cyberwarfare and the militarisation of space. He lays out several other foundations for “a grand strategy” for Australia, including no longer taking for granted America’s preparedness to defend Australia. Canberra’s strategy should also include increased investment in Australia’s cultural diplomacy and soft power in the region, and a return to “activist middle-power diplomacy involving coalition building across a range of issues”. Raby, an ambassador to Apec in the early 2000s, says regional states should seek common purpose when dealing with China “to remind Beijing that a push against one is a push against all”. After serving as Canberra’s top diplomat in Beijing for four years until 2011, Raby has more recently provided advisory services to Australian and Chinese businesses. He is registered on the Australian government’s foreign influence transparency scheme as a board member of Yancoal, a resources company that is listed on the Australian stock exchange but majority-owned by a Chinese state-owned enterprise. In the book, Raby criticises the Chinese government over “widespread internment camps” across the Xinjiang region and notes Xi Jinping’s “increasingly authoritarian control of domestic politics”.
“Having as our major economic partner a wilful, difficult, abrasive but nonetheless brittle and still weak power, one that is more comfortable with tyranny than democracy, but on which Australia’s economic wellbeing and security in the region rest, is the dystopian future that Australian policymakers will need to learn to navigate,” he writes. Raby summarises the Chinese government’s strategic objectives as security for its borders, respect for its territorial integrity, and protecting the continued rule of the Communist party. He argues China is “a constrained superpower” that acts as “both a status quo power and a disruptor” and has a range of strategic vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities include China’s heavy dependence on other countries for the resources and energy it needs to fuel its economic growth, leaving it exposed to future disruptions in supply.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1501,CBI boss says England lockdown means 'bleak midwinter' for UK firms,11/2/20,"British companies face the prospect of a “bleak mid-winter” according to the boss of the UK’s biggest lobby group, after high-street retailers, pub chains and airlines warned of the impact a second lockdown in England will have on their businesses. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said the latest English lockdown was in some ways worse than the first one, which started in March. The new restrictions in England mean that non-essential shops and all pubs and restaurants will be forced to close from Thursday until at least 2 December. Domestic and international travel will also be banned, except for work, education or other legally permitted reasons. “I’ve got to be really honest, there are ways in which this lockdown is also much worse,” said Fairbairn, speaking at the CBI’s annual conference before she steps down later this week. “Gas tanks are depleted, factories run down in so many businesses across the country, in retail, in hospitality. Our aviation sector is absolutely on its knees. “We are heading into winter, a bleak midwinter. This is the run-up to Christmas. It is the most important time for so many firms.” The government has extended its coronavirus job retention scheme until December, paying 80% of the wages of furloughed workers, but Fairbairn said the short extension would not give longer-term clarity for businesses looking to plan beyond the next month. That criticism was echoed on Monday by other businesses who warned that they would be severely affected by the hastily announced restrictions.
Jonathan Neame, the chief executive of Shepherd Neame, one of Britain’s oldest breweries, criticised the government for a “fourth change of strategy affecting hospitality within the last six weeks”, in an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. He said: “There is, I’m afraid, zero trust within hospitality about the government’s strategy at this moment in time and there’s a real sense that we’re going into lockdown for what is purported to be one month but in reality could be through to March. That would be absolutely catastrophic for the sector.” Associated British Foods, the owner of Primark, said it would lose £375m in sales from the high-street clothing retailer because of the new English lockdown and other restrictions in key European markets. In an update on Monday it said that 57% of its shops would be closed temporarily from Thursday. GVC Holdings, the owner of betting brands including Ladbrokes and Coral, issued a profit warning, estimating that the latest restrictions, including the closure of high-street branches in England and Europe, would cost it £37m. The government also faced criticism over its handling of the lockdown announcement. The first leaks of the intention to impose a new lockdown were reported on Friday evening, after UK markets closed. The reports prompted a scramble from the government to flesh out the details of the lockdown, as well as confusion among businesses. The boss of Britain’s biggest airport group, Manchester Airlines Group, hit out at the government for its “shocking” neglect of the aviation and travel industry, and accused the prime minister of “effectively shutting down his business” via Twitter. Charlie Cornish, the chief executive of the group, whose remit includes Manchester and London Stansted airports, said airports would be forced to act quickly to secure their futures after the new travel ban.
MAG is planning to cut 900 jobs. Cornish said urgent government support was needed to prevent more job losses in an industry that had been buffeted by “chaotic changes in policy” throughout the pandemic. No dedicated package of support has been given to aviation, despite early indications from the chancellor that specific measures would be considered. Cornish said there had been no warning or discussion with the industry about the travel ban. He said: “Given the huge impact on the hundreds of thousands of people working in the aviation and travel industry, it is shocking that the prime minister didn’t consider the shutdown of international travel worthy of mention … [but] symbolic of the way government has neglected UK aviation and the role it plays our economy from day one of this pandemic.” The chief executive of the exercise chain PureGym said the decision to close gyms in England was “regressive” and would damage millions of users’ health. Humphrey Cobbold said the company, which will temporarily close 236 gyms, had written to the prime minister asking him to class gyms as an essential service, or else face the prospect of “significant closures” in the sector.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1502,Chinese flyovers towards Taiwan peaked in October amid rising tensions,11/2/20,"China’s military sent planes towards Taiwan on 25 of the 31 days of October, the highest frequency of the antagonistic sorties all year, a Taiwanese monitoring group has said. The report comes as the Taiwanese government seeks to hose down reports that it is concerned at the prospect of Joe Biden becoming the next US president and taking a more conciliatory approach to China than Donald Trump. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has ratcheted up military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait this year, amid increasing hostilities with Taiwan and the US. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a wayward province and has not ruled out taking it by force. Citing a local monitoring group, Taiwan’s Liberty Times said the PLA had invaded Taiwan’s air identification zone on at least 25 days last month. Taiwan is building up its defence capabilities to discourage any possible cross-strait conflict, and has spent more than $1bn this year in scrambling jets to respond to the sorties towards and over the so-called “median line” in the Strait. But analysts say the prospect of defending itself against an invasion would rely on outside assistance.
While the US has a longstanding policy of refusing to says if it would come to Taiwan’s aid in the instance of an attack – in order to deter both sides – it has increased its military activity in the region and its arms sales to Taiwan under Trump, amid a broader push back against Chinese dominance in the region. Taiwan’s government has been forced to reject media reports by the Washington Post that some within the government feared a Biden-led administration would be less supportive of Taiwan. Taiwan’s representative to the US, Hsiao Bi-khim, said on Sunday the government did not take positions on US elections. “Since arriving in Washington, I have reached out to new friends and old friends in both parties, and I appreciate the bipartisan support and friendship for Taiwan,” she said. The US stance against Chinese aggression has won Trump support among the Taiwanese public, where a recent YouGov poll found 45% of respondents thought his actions had had a positive impact on their region, while a third thought the impact had been negative. It found Trump was supported by 42% of Taiwanese people compared with Biden’s 30%, the only Asian population polled that supported Trump over Biden. The US considers Taiwan an important barrier to China’s control in the Indo-Pacific and has increased diplomatic and other support this year, despite not having formal ties. The former US defence official Randall Schriver last month described the island as a “modern-day Asia Fulda Gap”, referring to the region between East and West Germany that was considered the most likely place for a US-Soviet Union Cold War clash. PJ Crowley, the former assistant secretary of state for public affairs under Barrack Obama, told the Guardian the deterioration of US-China relations was “arguably the most consequential development” in geopolitics during Trump’s term. “Regardless of who is president come January, there will be an assessment of what has occurred in Hong Kong and what it means for Taiwan,” Crowley said. “If Vice President Biden wins, he will need to make clear to [China’s president] Xi [Jinping] hat he will become more active with respect to Hong Kong and Taiwan … Maintaining the high-level dialogue with Taipei would be one way to demonstrate that what happens there remains important to the United States.” Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1503,Chips are down: Brexit uncertainty causing Scottish potato crisis,11/2/20,"Scottish potato farmers have said that uncertainty surrounding their ability to sell to Northern Ireland post-Brexit is causing millions of pounds in losses, prompting Scotland’s environment minister to accuse the government of treating the industry as “expendable” in trade talks. While fisheries in Scotland have been treated as a priority in Brexit talks, Scottish seed potato farmers – one of the biggest exporters for the production of chips and crisps in the world – have been told they will be unlikely to be able to export to Northern Ireland from 1 January as things stand. Seed potatoes are potatoes from which others are grown but with strict EU-wide health checks for blight, pest and other diseases before being sold commercially. The Scottish industry accounts for 75% of UK production and is worth more than £200m a year, six times the value of the recently signed fisheries deal with Norway but dwarfed by the £1.4bn overall UK fishing trade. Mairi Gougeon has written to Lord Gardiner of Kimble, the parliamentary under secretary of state for rural affairs, to say Scottish potato farmers, many of them running family businesses, have been put under “incredible strain”. At the centre of the issue is Northern Ireland’s special place after Brexit, following EU customs rules on food and animals coming in from Britain whether there is a trade deal or not. But Gougeon complained that while the UK was offering the EU a six-month transition period to allow European seeds and plants to be sold in Britain, “the reciprocal arrangement is not available to us”. This leaves EU markets and Northern Ireland closed to Scotland’s producers. “I must request again that you urgently contact the EU to press for an early resolution of the UK equivalence applications,” she wrote in a letter seen by the Guardian, adding that the industry faced an initial £15m financial loss “as a result of not having access to the EU or NI”. Officials at Defra have said they are waiting for the EU to recognise equivalence but farmers say they can’t run a business on such uncertainty with just 59 days to go before the end of the UK’s transition period. Iain Barbour, who runs the decades-old JBA Seed Potatoes in Dumfries with his father, said the situation was making people’s lives “miserable”. “If there was a huge disaster and the Northern Ireland potato crop failed, we would not be allowed to send in seed potatoes to help them. Even Asda and Tescos, they wouldn’t be allowed to have eating potatoes from us,” he said. Scottish seed potatoes are considered a global gold standard because they are less prone to diseases because of the climate, which puts them at a higher standard than EU regulations, he said. With the first seed potatoes planted around 17 March for early harvests at the end of May, “customers in Northern Ireland are rushing to stock up,” said Barbour in case the Scottish spud is banned from 1 January. Boris Johnson claimed the EU were threatening to “blockade” food supplies to Northern Ireland last month, taking the issue to an explosive political level. Seed suppliers are now fearing they will be collateral damage. “I’m actually really annoyed about it. We’ve seen a 6,000% increase in demand from some of our customers who are stockpiling,” said Paulo Arrigo, who runs Italian vegetable seed supplier Franchi in Harrow. “Do you know what Defra’s advice was? Tell everyone in Northern Ireland to get their stocks in before Christmas,” said Arrigo. A Defra spokesman said it understood the importance of seed and other propagating material exports for UK horticultural businesses, and remained committed to securing market access beyond the end of the transition period. “We have already formally submitted the equivalence application, on behalf of the UK, to the European commission – and await their response,” he said.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1504,"Covid lockdowns are cost of self-isolation failures, says WHO expert",11/2/20,"Lockdowns affecting entire populations is a price countries pay for failing to ensure people with coronavirus and their contacts self-isolate, according to an expert from the World Health Organization. The WHO does not recommend that countries enter lockdowns. It has consistently said that the key to controlling epidemics, whether Covid-19, Sars or flu, is to test people, trace their contacts and ensure all those who are positive or who have been close to those infected are quarantined. While countries like the UK have been massively increasing the numbers of tests carried out, contact tracing has fallen short, and studies have shown that as few as 20% of people in England fully comply with self-isolation. “For me, the big missing link in what’s going on in many European countries is management of isolation,” said Dr Margaret Harris of the WHO. “That’s not just isolation of people who are sick – it’s isolation of people who have contacts and are first-degree contacts. “They don’t think they have Covid, because they feel fine, and even if they are told they should stay home, they don’t feel a strong social obligation or they do not necessarily have that reinforced as happens in some countries. “So for instance, in a place like Hong Kong, you would be called every day, or the police come to your house,” she said. Across Asia, there is a mixture of economies that have managed the virus well – not just those that may be non-liberal, non-democratic command economies, she added. “Taiwan, for instance, probably has the best management. They are definitely a highly liberal society.” A lockdown which effectively isolates everyone does work, Harris said, “but it also causes massive dislocation, massive disruption. And unless you’ve worked out how you can possibly put that pause button on and maintain your economic and social lives, the price you pay is very, very high.” The WHO doesn’t say don’t do it, she said. “We just say, if you’re doing it, you’re paying a very high price, so therefore get some return for what you pay.” That means getting test and trace to work efficiently “and you could think very hard about how to make self-isolation doable” she said. “You’ve got to do it at grassroots level, because it’s very different, say, in London from somewhere rural, it’s different in housing estates, you may have people living on the streets, you may have people living in institutions. So, you have to really know your society, and know how you’re going to make it possible for them to self-isolate.
“There will be people who cannot possibly self-isolate, because they live in crowded conditions or on the streets. You may have to think of offering them somewhere else to stay. “It does require a lot of planning. It requires a lot of a great deal of partnership with community and with local authorities, and really listening to your mayors and your councils and all the people in your local groups or your NGOs who understand how communities really function and ensure that you’re reaching everyone. “You might have communities who don’t have access to standard English-language channels and all the rest of it, and don’t really know what is being asked of them or whether it’s possible.” Harris said that some places, such as Hong Kong, isolate those who have Covid-19 by putting them in hospital with even mild symptoms, which means it is far easier and quicker to spot those who deteriorate and treat them, saving lives. Early medical monitoring helped with getting people the right treatment, she added, and although it’s not yet clear, getting earlier care to people could also save some from the after-effects known as long Covid.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1505,Covid: Boris Johnson faces Tory fury amid hints of further England lockdown,11/2/20,"Boris Johnson will insist there is “no alternative” to a nationwide lockdown as he addresses the House of Commons on Monday amid mounting fury among Tory MPs, after ministers conceded the new “stay at home” order could be extended beyond 2 December. The prime minister will tell parliament that without the draconian new measures, which will come into force across England on Thursday, deaths from coronavirus over the winter could be “twice as bad or even worse” than in the first wave. He will promise the government will “seek to ease” restrictions when the measures are due to expire. However, cabinet minister Michael Gove made clear on Sunday they could be left in place if they have not yet brought the infection rate down sufficiently. Gove said: “We’ve got this four-week period, during which we’re going to review progress, but of course we’ll always be driven by the data. We will always take a decision in the national interest, based on evidence.” Pressed by Sophy Ridge on Sky News about whether that meant the measures could be extended, he said “yes”. Sage member Jeremy Farrar, the chair of the Wellcome Trust, echoed Gove’s caution, saying it was important not to be too “fixed” about the 2 December end date. If the infection rate, hospital admissions and other key metrics had not fallen far enough by then, he said, the measures should be extended. “Much better to do that than remove these restrictions and then have to impose even more draconian restrictions over Christmas or soon into the new year,” he told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show. The latest official data showed that on Sunday, 23,254 people were tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK. A further 162 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. Johnson will set out his plan to parliament after a chaotic weekend that saw his dramatic announcement brought forward after it was leaked on Friday evening, causing shock among his own backbenchers. Amid forecasts that the economy could take a hit of up to 10% as a result of the new curbs, the Bank of England is poised to announce a fresh cash injection into the economy later this week. The City had been expecting a resumption of Threadneedle Street’s quantitative easing programme even before the new lockdown was announced, but now sees a fresh support package as inevitable. The Treasury plans to announce more generous support for the self-employed following the continuation of the furlough scheme for employees, but no further measures from the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, are currently planned. Gerard Lyons, who was chief economic adviser to Johnson when he was mayor of London, said the lockdown was “terrible news” for the economy, which he said could shrink by up to 10%. “This lockdown will ensure that a large section of the economy will be in a moribund state and will require huge new stimulus and help,” Lyons said. Sunak had previously resisted a nationwide shutdown amid fears about its economic cost, but signed up to the plan in the face of the risk of hospitals being overwhelmed within weeks without action. “If you have an NHS that’s not going to function, people are not going to be running off shopping, they’re going to stay at home. The economy gets crumpled anyway – and people lose faith in government,” said a Whitehall source. Sunak’s abrupt decision to extend the furlough scheme, which pays 80% of workers’ wages in affected businesses, was met with fury among northern mayors, who repeatedly urged him to take the same approach when cities including Manchester and Liverpool were facing tough tier 3 restrictions last month. “This morning millions of people woke up knowing the prime minister of this country believes the north is worth less than the south,” Steve Rotheram, the Liverpool city region mayor, said. “Quite frankly, the government has treated us with contempt again.” Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, called for an end to the government’s “differential treatment” of people on low wages and “people in the north versus people in the south”. Conservative MPs also lined up to criticise the government’s approach on Sunday. Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, told BBC Radio 4’s Westminster Hour that he will vote against the government’s lockdown measures in the vote on Wednesday. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said he feared the lockdown would last until the spring, as the virus resurges. “In March, Boris said let’s hope this will only last four weeks, and it lasted four months. My firm belief this time is it will last six months. Because when it gets to 2 December and R is still 1.5, which it will be, because this lockdown will hold less well than the last one, then it will have to continue.” He said only countries that have aggressively pursued a “test, trace and isolate” approach, including drastic measures such as closing borders and separating those testing positive from their families in isolation wards, had managed to control it successfully. Another former cabinet minister said they believed ministers had been left with little choice but to act, but the “shambles” of the weekend “could cost us dearly in the polls”. Former minister George Freeman said he would support the government – but only on the basis of a clear strategy that would see more power handed to local leaders to balance health and economic risks in their areas in the future. MPs will be given a vote on the measures on Wednesday, before they come into force – but they are likely to pass with Labour support, even if a significant number of Conservatives rebel. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, will urge the government to use the four-week lockdown period to fix the shortcomings in the test-and-trace system. He will call for much more extensive “retrospective” contact tracing to identify the source of outbreaks, and urge the government to use new rapid saliva-based testing kits to carry out weekly screening of high-risk workers. These should include NHS staff, as well as other at-risk workers such as those in education, transport, retail and hospitality, Ashworth will suggest. “Coronavirus is growing with ferocity and urgent action is needed to bring the R below 1 nationwide which is why Labour urged Boris Johnson to use the opportunity of the half-term holiday for a time-limited ‘circuit break’,” he said. “This didn’t happen, and test and trace have been overwhelmed. Controlling Covid-19 depends on fixing tracing, ensuring the quick turnaround of tests and introducing regular, weekly testing to identify the 70% of carriers who may not have symptoms but can still spread the virus.” Speaking to MPs, Johnson will stand by his decision not to lock England down earlier as scientific advisers recommended in September – a choice Labour claims will have cost lives. “I know some in the house believe we should have reached this decision earlier, but I believe it was right to try every possible option to get this virus under control at a local level, with strong local action and strong local leadership,” the prime minister is expected to say.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1506,Donald Trump threatens to fire Anthony Fauci after US election,11/2/20,"Donald Trump threatened to fire Anthony Fauci, America’s top infectious disease expert, during a midnight rally in Florida 24 hours before the presidential election.
As crowds at the Miami Opa-Locka airport chanted “Fire Fauci”, Trump allowed the chants to continue for several seconds before responding: “Don’t tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election. I appreciate the advice. I appreciate it.” He continued: “Nah, he’s been wrong on a lot. He’s a nice man though. He’s been wrong on a lot.” Fauci, 79 and one of the world’s foremost infectious diseases experts, has served under six presidents over three decades as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He is one of the lead experts on Trump’s coronavirus taskforce and has frequently offered frank public health guidance in contrast to the president’s repeated falsehoods on the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic. In a hard-hitting interview with the Washington Post published on Saturday night, Fauci said the US should prepare for “a whole lot of hurt” under the coronavirus pandemic and predicted a winter of 100,000 or more cases a day and a rising death toll. “It’s not a good situation,” Fauci said. “All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.” Trump’s rally in Florida, a critical swing state he needs to hold to win the election, was held as Covid-19 cases in the state continued to surge. Like countless Trump rallies there was no social distancing and thousands of attendees did not wear masks.
Miami-Dade county, where the event took place, has a midnight curfew to mitigate the spread of the virus. The county ordinance states the curfew is “necessary to safeguard life and health, as parties and gatherings late at night have the potential to spread Covid-19”. Trump’s speech continued well past midnight and attendees were still leaving after 1am. The rally was Trump’s fifth event of the day, in a packed schedule that saw him visit five states as the election reached its final day of campaigning. Polls showed Trump behind in Florida by an average of 2.2%, foreshadowing a close race. On Monday morning, the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, responded to Trump’s comments on Twitter. “We need a president who actually listens to experts like Dr Fauci,” Biden posted. More than 9.1m cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the US and more than 230,000 people have died, marking one of the worst per-capita death rates in the world. Daily case counts vary but agree that on Friday the US set a world record for cases in a single day, between 99,000 and 100,000, as numbers surge in several states, many of them electoral battlegrounds key to control of the White House.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1507,Doubts over 'rapid turnaround' Covid tests pledged by Johnson,11/2/20,"The “rapid turnaround” coronavirus tests the prime minister announced on Saturday are not approved for the public to interpret themselves without an expert’s help and so will not provide results in the promised 15 minutes, the Guardian has learned. Boris Johnson’s briefing about this week’s national lockdown in England included the promise of a mass rollout of “tests that you can use yourself to tell whether or not you are infectious and get the result within 10 to 15 minutes”, which would be made available at universities and across whole cities. He said the army would be deployed to roll out the “many millions of cheap, reliable and above all rapid turnaround tests” everywhere they were needed.
Three of these rapid antigen tests, called lateral flow tests, have passed an assessment by Porton Down with Oxford University. The government has bought one of them. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced the government had signed a deal for 20 million, from the company Innova Tried and Tested, on 19 October. But the Innova tests are not for people without symptoms, such as university students or people wanting to get on a plane or go to the theatre. They are designed for people who already have Covid symptoms. And the devices, which look like a pregnancy test, are intended to be read by a healthcare professional. The company is clear about their limitations on the instructions for use, which can be found on its website. The tests analyse throat and nose swabs “from individuals who are suspected of Covid-19 by their healthcare provider, within the first five days of the onset of symptoms”. The test is designed for use by trained lab and healthcare staff, it says. Johnson hopes the tests will help show the way out of the pandemic. They will be deployed in a wide range of situations, he said, “from helping women to have their partners with them in labour wards when they’re giving birth, to testing whole towns and even whole cities. “The army has been brought in to work on the logistics and the programme will begin in a matter of days, working with local communities, local government, public health directors and organisations of all kinds to help people discover whether or not they are infectious, and then immediately to get them to self-isolate and to stop the spread.” Prof Jon Deeks from Birmingham University and a member of a working group of the Royal Statistical Society, which is looking at coronavirus tests, said they were not ready for this type of use. “At the moment, if you were bought this test, you would not be using it for this purpose,” he told the Guardian. Lateral flow tests are now being offered to students at two universities – Durham and De Montfort – in a pilot study. Deeks questioned whether those involved had the right information. “There are real issues in what people are being told in these studies,” he said. There was no transparency around the assessment of the lateral flow tests, he said. The announcement that the three tests had passed did not explain how they were assessed or how well they performed. While everyone agrees that lateral flow tests, which could use either swab samples from the nose and mouth or saliva, have huge promise, Deeks said the technology at the moment appeared to struggle to register low levels of virus. They may pick up people who are infected and have high virus levels and may have symptoms, but they tend to miss people who are asymptomatic, as many young and fit people are. A second test approved by Porton Down, from the Korean company SD Biosensor, has been validated by the World Health Organization and a package of support has been agreed to supply low- and middle-income countries that do not have access to PCR lab testing. However, these tests are also to be read by a healthcare professional. Mass testing was part of the government’s controversial Moonshot plans. Last week the Guardian revealed that local health leaders had been asked to sign up to testing 10% of their populations every week using lateral flow tests, following the announcement of the deal with Innova.
In a leaked letter, Alex Cooper, the director of rapid testing at NHS test and trace, said the ambition was “to make this technology available for local areas to roll out at pace”, adding that the programme would go nationwide “as quickly as possible”. Labour has called for frontline workers and vulnerable people living in coronavirus hotspots to be tested every week. NHS staff and those working in education, transport, retail and hospitality, as well as at-risk groups in areas with high infections, should be given access to rapid saliva tests, the party said. It urged ministers to use the November lockdown to expand testing and fix contact tracing, saying that a plan to roll out strategic mass testing would provide a roadmap for containing the virus.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1508,Egyptian NHS doctor stricken by Covid seeks visa reassurances from Home Office,11/2/20,"An Egyptian NHS doctor who became critically ill after complications from contracting Covid-19 has spoken for the first time about his fears of being removed from the UK by the Home Office while he lay in his hospital bed on a ventilator. Dr Basem Enany, a locum consultant cardiologist at York teaching hospital, had treated many coronavirus patients. He was placed on a ventilator after developing Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare complication of Covid-19 and other viruses, which has left him partially paralysed. He can now breathe unaided but believes he has a long rehabilitation journey ahead of him. “At first I had the usual symptoms of Covid – cough, fever, loss of taste and smell – but then I began to develop a weakness throughout my body. Then I was no longer able to move and couldn’t breathe properly.” he said. “I had never seen this happen in any of the Covid patients I had treated and had to research my symptoms as they were so unusual.” He has a work visa that is due to expire next month. He and his wife, Marwa Mohamed, believe they and their four young daughters could face removal from the UK as he is unlikely to be well enough by December to renew the visa. While Enany has regained partial use of his hands, his legs remain paralysed and he is waiting to be moved from Leeds general infirmary to a specialist neuro-rehabilitation facility. “I was not sedated on the ventilator and was lying awake in my hospital bed thinking: ‘Oh my God, my visa is about to finish,’” he said. Enany thanked the dedicated NHS workers who have been looking after him and the more than 4,000 people who have made donations to a crowdfund that will pay for his legal and medical bills. Any remaining funds will be donated to research into Covid-19 and into Guillain-Barré syndrome. While the Home Office has said it had no plans to deport the family, Enany does not know what kind of replacement visa he will receive, how long it will be for and whether it will allow work. While Enany thanked the Home Office for its reassurances, he said: “We still don’t have any solid documents in our hands and my visa will expire soon.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We’ve spoken to Dr Enany’s family to reassure them that their immigration status is not in jeopardy and they are not facing enforcement action. They are here entirely legally and have every right to remain the UK. We will continue to work with them to find a way forward. Our thoughts remain with Dr Enany and his family at this difficult time.” On Friday there will be the second reading of a private member’s bill from THE Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine calling for indefinite leave to remain to be granted to migrant NHS workers who have cared for patients during the pandemic. In her presentation of the bill she says that these NHS workers will be vital during the second wave of the pandemic.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1509,Fault in NHS Covid app meant thousands at risk did not quarantine,11/2/20,"A code error in the NHS Covid-19 app meant users had to be next to a highly infectious patient for five times as long as the NHS had decided was risky before being instructed to self-isolate, the Guardian has learned.
The oversight in the app meant thousands of people were told they did not need to quarantine when they were in fact at risk of spreading coronavirus. The problem was only discovered last week, when software engineers rewrote how the app decides who needs to isolate and discovered it had been relying on faulty maths since its launch in September. According to the Sunday Times, which reported on the flaw, a source said the fault meant that a “shockingly low” number of warnings were issued. Despite claiming more than 19m downloads of the app, which is for use in England and Wales, the UK government has continually declined to reveal how many users have been advised to isolate. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, where similar apps have fewer users, more than 25,000 people have been warned of their possible exposure to the virus. A Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said the England and Wales version was “the only app in the world using the latest Google-Apple technology to better gauge distance to identify those most at risk, and is deemed ‘excellent’ by international standards. “We anticipate more app users who are at high risk of having caught the virus will receive a notification to self-isolate, and that will be to everyone’s long term benefit by reducing the chances of those with the virus passing it on to others. We are very clear, everyone who is contacted will have been in close contact with someone who has a confirmed case of COVID-19.”
The root of the error, the Guardian has learned, was a decision to incorporate a measure of “infectiousness” into the app’s code. While the app was undergoing testing in the Isle of Wight, it used a simple metric that recommended isolation for anyone who had been in contact – closer than 2 metres – with a potentially infectious person for 15 minutes or more in a single day. But shortly before the app was launched nationally, it was updated to account for the fact that people are most infectious shortly after their symptoms show. The maths was changed so that people outside that period of peak infectiousness counted for just two-fifths of the risk. Since that meant the overall score was likely to be lower, the intention was to reduce the risk threshold correspondingly to ensure that someone of maximum infectiousness would need just three minutes of contact before they triggered an alert. But that change never happened, and as a result, users were only told to isolate if they had spent 15 minutes close to a very infectious person, or nearly 40 minutes near someone who was pre-symptomatic but still thought to be shedding the virus. The error was only discovered when a new version of the contact-tracing app, which can better account for exposures at mid-range (over a metre away) was created. The unfeasibly high risk score also explained another problem plaguing the app: “ghost notifications” warning users that they may have been exposed to someone with Covid, but which never resulted in advice to isolate. The app’s initial advice to users was that these notifications could be safely ignored, since they reflected a contact below the risk threshold; now that the NHS risk threshold is known to have been artificially low, one insider said, it is likely that the vast majority of those ghost notifications should in fact have been advice to self-isolate. The new version of the app does away with them altogether: users will now only receive a notification if they are supposed to self-isolate. “By removing these notifications, users can have the confidence that if they have a contact notification, they know it is from the app itself and based on the most accurate information available,” say Randeep Sidhu head of product for the test and trace app, and Gaby Appleton, the director.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1510,"For the sake of Cameroon, life-president Paul Biya must be forced out | Vava Tampa",11/2/20,"On 6 December, Africa’s oldest serving leader, Paul Biya, and his ruling party, Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (RDPC), will be declared the winner of the country’s first ever regional elections. That much is clear, and is expected inside and outside of the west African country – Biya has misruled with an iron fist for nearly 40 years. But the question we should be asking, but as yet have not, is what this means for Cameroon’s 25 million people. In my view the answer is more poverty, more violence, more corruption and more suffering. This should compel us all to act. As Africa’s largest producer of timber and the world’s fifth-largest producer of the cocoa, Cameroon should be a rich country. But Biya’s life-presidency, corruption and use of indiscriminate violence as a first resort have made Cameroon a country in crisis; on a downward trajectory I fear the world will only wake up to when nobody is left to save and Biya is too frail to stand trial. Since independence from France in 1960, Cameroon has been ruled by one party and two presidents. Biya, who “won” his seventh term with more than 70% in 2018, has been in power since 1982, before 75% of the population was even born. His current mandate will expire in 2025 when he’ll be 92. He is planning to run again. A vote for regional councils has been promised since 1996. So why is Biya is rushing to organise it now, in a middle of a coronavirus pandemic as well as a local separatist war that has, according to the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa, killed more than 4,000 people and internally displaced a further 500,000? Simple. Because Biya is trying to deflect local pressure and international criticism for his misrule and abuse. The way I see it, Biya is losing the argument against the English-speaking south-west and north-west regions who want to create an independent anglophone state to free themselves from this despot.
In 2017, the longstanding tensions between Biya’s Paris-backed regime and the English-speaking regions morphed into an all separatist conflict. The English-speaking regions want to succeed from Cameroon. Even I, someone who is against post-independence separatism in Africa, cannot help but think how they could not. Biya has turned Cameroon into a highly authoritarian and fascinatingly corrupt country. It actually earned Transparency International’s No 1 ranking as “the world corruption champion” two years in a row, in 1998 and 1999. Many Cameroonians live in dire poverty. According to the World Food Programme, 40% live below the poverty line. Another estimated 6.2 million are in need of humanitarian assistance. That’s 25% of the population. The renewed escalation of violence by Boko Haram in Nigeria and the Lake Chad region is adding to the suffering. The terrible irony of Biya’s ploy to deflect attention is that the elections will exacerbate the longstanding grievances of the English-speaking communities. After nearly three years of separatist violence, the two sides are currently at an impasse. For me, the best way forward for peace and for the reunification of Cameroon is to force out Biya, whose tentacles pry into every aspect of the country, choking life and talent. But France, the former colonial power, is still betting on one of its leading African strongmen and his electoral ploy, even though everyone knows it will not be free, fair or transparent. For France, the rebel regions’ ongoing struggle is an unforgivable sin against FranceAfrique, still recovering from the locals’ rejection of the CFA Franc. Secession in Cameroon could kill FranceAfrique. But, in doing so, France is strengthening the separatist’s strongest argument that Cameroon’s institutions represent only Biya and his corrupt, Paris-backed, Francophile elites who exploit the region’s resources and kill with impunity. This is why I think the poll will become a flash point, resulting in an escalation of the violence which persists, especially in opposition stronghold English-speaking regions where rebels have banned voting. Cameroon’s stabilisation should have started in 1992 after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold war when Biya reluctantly adopted a multiparty system. But his greed and obsession with power has rendered this impossible. So long as Biya is in power the violence or corruption will not stop soon. Cameroon will continue on the downward trajectory that has characterised it for almost 40 years. Just how many more lives and dreams must a dictator like Biya destroy before France stops supporting him and his electoral ploy? • Vava Tampa is a freelance writer, focusing on Africa’s great lakes, decolonisation and culture",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1511,Global coronavirus report: WHO chief self-isolates as Germany starts 'wave breaker' lockdown,11/2/20,"The head of the World Health Organization has gone into self-quarantine after someone he had been in contact with tested positive for Covid-19. With the virus again spreading rapidly across Europe and elsewhere, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is based in Geneva, made the announcement by Twitter late on Sunday night, but stressed he had no symptoms. “I have been identified as a contact of someone who has tested positive for Covid-19,” Tedros said in his tweet.
“I am well and without symptoms but will self-quarantine over the coming days, in line with @WHO protocols, and work from home,” he added. Tedros has been at the forefront of the UN health agency’s efforts to battle the pandemic, which has claimed the lives of 1.2 million and infected more than 46.6 million people worldwide since emerging in China late last year, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. He stressed on Twitter that “it is critically important that we all comply with health guidance. This is how we will break chains of Covid-19 transmission, suppress the virus, and protect health systems.” Countries across Europe reintroduced or strengthened existing lockdown measures on Monday. Germany went into “lockdown light” mode, with bars, cinemas, theatres, museums, fitness studios and swimming pools closing and cafes and restaurants allowed to offer takeaway food only. Meetings in public have been restricted to two households or no more than 10 people. Unlike during the first lockdown in the spring, schools and nurseries will stay open. The new “wave breaker” restrictions will for now only apply until the end of the month, but the government is not ruling out an extension. On Sunday, the health minister, Jens Spahn, called on the public to prepare for “months of restrictions and abstinence”. The chancellor, Angela Merkel, told a news conference on Monday that Germany was still some way off an end to the pandemic but if people respected the restrictions over the next four weeks “then we will be able to have the conditions for a tolerable December.” “Throughout the winter months, we will have to limit private contacts,” Merkel said. “The light at the end of the tunnel is still quite a long way off.” Italy will tighten its restrictions but is holding back from reintroducing a nationwide lockdown, its prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said, as infections, hospital admissions and deaths rise. Conte told Italy’s parliament tougher measures, including curbing travel between the worst-hit regions and a night-time curfew, were now needed. Italy’s daily tally of infections has increased tenfold over the last month and hovered around 30,000 in the last few days, while hospital admissions, intensive care occupancy and deaths have also risen steeply.
“Despite our efforts … the evolution of the epidemic in the last few days is very worrying,” Conte said, adding that intensive care units would be overwhelmed in 15 of Italy’s 20 regions by next month unless tougher action was taken. “We must intervene with more stringent measures,” he told the Chamber of Deputies, saying the country would be divided into three areas depending on the risk level, with certain places facing tighter restrictions than others. Meanwhile, Portugal’s prime minister, António Costa, asked the country’s president to declare a state of emergency as a preventive measure to fight the spread of the virus The last Covid-19 state of emergency, which under Portuguese law is limited to 15 days but can be extended indefinitely in 15-day periods if necessary, was declared by President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa in March and lasted six weeks. “It is a critical moment and declaring the … emergency will reinforce the civic awareness of the sanitary emergency we are facing,” Costa told reporters, adding the move was likely to last much longer than 15 days. The president was expected to proclaim the emergency in a televised address on Monday evening and then parliament would then have to enact it – both are considered formalities. The weekend was marked by street protests against further restrictions on daily life, including in Italy and Spain, where the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, called for an end to “the violent and irrational behaviour” of a minority of people after demonstrations against the government’s decision to declare a six-month state of emergency. On Sunday night more than 300 people gathered in the centre of São Paulo, Brazil, to protest against state governor João Doria’s support for mandatory Covid-19 immunisation and testing the potential vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac. The country’s health minister, Eduardo Pazuello, who is ill with Covid, remained in hospital on Sunday night after having been discharged from a civilian facility earlier in the day. Anti-science sentiment was also on display in the US, where supporters of Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Florida on Sunday night began chanting “Fire Fauci” – and the president hinted that he may do so after the election.
The hostility towards Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government’s leading expert on infectious diseases, comes after he angered the White House by warning that the coming winter would see the virus continue to spread. Two weeks ago, Trump suggested that Fauci was an “idiot”. Reuters contributed to this report",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1512,Handful of businesses threaten to defy lockdown in England,11/2/20,"Businesses including a beauty salon near Liverpool are vowing to remain open and defy England’s lockdown when it comes into force on Thursday. Companies face a £10,000 fine if they refuse to comply with restrictions ordering the closure of pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, gyms and all non-essential retailers. Regulations setting out the new laws in England are due to be published on Tuesday before being put to a vote by MPs on Wednesday. If passed, as expected, the measures would come into effect at 12.01am on Thursday. While the vast majority of businesses are expected to comply with the rules, a small number have publicly vowed to flout them.
The beauty salon in Bootle, Merseyside, whose owners have denied the existence of coronavirus, said it would open as usual on Thursday and fight any fine through the courts. A message on the Instagram page of Skin Kerr said: “We will not be locking down again. We will remain open. We will fight this and any fines in a common law court.” The owner of the salon previously described the pandemic as a “bullshit voodoo virus” and displayed posters saying: “You can’t catch what doesn’t exist,” as well as banning masks and “Covid talk”. The salon did not respond to a request to comment. It posted a clip on Instagram on Sunday of the conspiracy theorist David Icke calling Covid-19 “a scam” and urging businesses to “simply refuse to lock down”. A martial arts gym in Wigan has also vowed to stay open. In a Facebook post, the Majestic Gym claimed it was “cleaner and safer than any supermarket, fast food outlet or anywhere else that is allowed to stay open” and called on other businesses to “refuse to obey the tyranny”.
Kevin Harper, the gym’s owner, said his facility was “cleaner than an operating theatre” and that gyms were “as important as churches, hospitals, pubs and restaurants” so should be allowed to stay open. He said he would fight any fine and “clog the legal system”. “I’ve not broken any laws. I have not injured anybody. I have not hurt anybody. That will be my legal argument. And on Thursday morning when I open up at 9.30 the police will be here, I guarantee, and I welcome them. These are not criminal matters. It’s preposterous.” Harper, who has run the gym for 12 years, falsely claimed that there was “no categorical scientific proof that coronavirus even exists” but that he had a rigorous safety process in place, including temperature checks on arrival, strict social distancing and a “50-page risk assessment”.
He added: “When we did that first lockdown, I nearly went bankrupt. I can’t afford to do that again. I’m not being selfish, I’m being realistic. I’ll switch salaries with the prime minister, if he wants to take my £750 a month that I’m currently getting. I’m not going to be able to survive. I’ve got children. My wife’s pregnant. I’ve no choice but to stay open.” Police chiefs are bracing themselves for potentially worse compliance among a weary public than during the first lockdown. Officers across the UK were called out to rule-breaking raves and house parties over the Halloween weekend.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1513,Help for self-employed in England to be doubled in November,11/2/20,"Boris Johnson has announced the government will double the level of financial support for self-employed workers in November during the second coronavirus lockdown in England. Faced with mounting pressure to help millions of workers before new measures are imposed on Thursday, the prime minister said the self-employment income support scheme (SEISS) would be increased from 40% of average profits to 80% in November. People who work for themselves will be able to apply from the end of the month – rather than the middle of December as initially planned – to help provide support faster during the second lockdown in England. It comes after the government announced a U-turn to extend the furlough scheme for employees at the weekend hours before it was due to close. Furlough will now subsidise 80% of workers’ wages in November, rather than a reduced level of two-thirds under the new job support scheme replacement programme, which will now be launched a month later in December instead.
Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, confirmed that the increase in help for the self-employed would be to an average of 55% of trading profits over the wider period from November to January, while the maximum grant available would increase to £5,160. Detailing the changes on Twitter, the chancellor said the fourth update to his economic support package in almost as many weeks would offer £4.5bn of help to self-employed workers between November and January. The Treasury said £13.7bn of support for self-employed people had been provided since the onset of the pandemic in March, on top of more than £40bn for employees through the furlough scheme. Sunak said: “The rapidly changing health picture has meant we have had to act in order to protect people’s lives and I know this is an incredibly worrying time for the self-employed. “That is why we have increased the generosity of the third grant, ensuring those who cannot trade or are facing decreased demand are able to get through the months ahead.” The chancellor said the deadline for businesses to apply for a Treasury-backed loan had also been further extended, until 31 January. The government-backed loan schemes have so far supported more than 1m businesses to access more than £60bn of finance. Business groups welcomed the additional measures but warned that millions of people were slipping through the cracks and urgently required support, including the newly self-employed, sole company directors and people who had lost their jobs. Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “Despite this extension, there are still many businesses and individuals who have, through no fault of their own,, not yet been able to access any government support since the start of the pandemic. “They too will require help to sustain their businesses and avoid further increases in unemployment.”",,Politics,Guardian,4

1516,Jacinda Ardern unveils diverse new cabinet to focus on Covid-19 recovery,11/2/20,"New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has brought in her right-hand man, Grant Robertson, as deputy leader as she unveiled a diverse new cabinet lineup to focus on Covid-19 containment and economic recovery. Robertson, one of Ardern’s most capable ministers and a close ally, handled the government’s spending in response to Covid-19. The government created a NZ$50bn Covid response and recovery fund targeted at new initiatives meant to address both the immediate response to the pandemic and the longer term economic damage left in its wake.
Robertson is the first gay man to hold the role of deputy prime minister. “I still get a lot of emails and messages from young gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people who look towards us to provide that kind of role-modelling,” he said. “So, I’ll keep doing my job the way that I’ve been doing it, but I’m very proud to have the role.” Of the 20-strong cabinet, eight are women, five are Māori, three are Pasifika and three are LGBT. In an unexpected move, Nanaia Mahuta, an MP since 1996, was appointed foreign minister, replacing New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, a populist maverick whose party was not returned to parliament at the election on 17 October. The trailblazing Māori MP will become the first female foreign minister in New Zealand’s history. Ardern said Mahuta showed “diplomacy skills that we need to represent New Zealand on the world stage” during her last three years as local government minister. “She is someone who builds fantastic relationships very, very quickly and that is one of the key jobs in a foreign affairs role,” Ardern said. Mahuta said she was “absolutely privileged” to take on the job. Mahuta was the first woman to wear a “moko”, into New Zealand’s parliament after getting the traditional Māori facial tattoo in 2016, two decades after she was first elected. She has previously held the customs and Māori development portfolios and will hold on to the local government ministry alongside her foreign responsibilities. Ardern also announced a new ministerial post for Covid-19 response, with Chris Hipkins taking the role. Hipkins took over as health minister in July when David Clark resigned following gaffes including going mountain biking during lockdown.
Hipkins responsibilities will include overseeing Covid-19 testing, managed isolation and border controls. He retains the education portfolio. Andrew Little, one of Labour’s most effective ministers, and the politician who begged Ardern to take his place as party leader before coming to power at the 2017 election, takes up the health portfolio. A new MP, Ayesha Verrall, an infectious disease doctor, has been brought straight into cabinet. Verrall was one of the Ardern government’s key scientific advisers during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Ardern said it would be foolish at this time not to use Verrall’s experience and said she wanted her voice in cabinet rather than in a consultation role. New Zealand’s response – to go hard and early on lockdowns – has been generally praised around the world, moreso as new lockdowns are being announced in Britain and Europe. Four new Covid-19 cases – all in managed isolation – were announced today. The last case in the community was 10 days ago, on 23 October. New Zealand has 77 active cases. Its total number of cases is 1603 including 25 deaths. A former prominent cabinet minister, Phil Twyford, paid the price for under-delivery of Kiwibuild – the programme aimed at addressing homelessness and housing affordability – and transport projects. He has been given minor portfolios outside cabinet. Green Party leaders James Shaw and Marama Davidson are also ministers outside cabinet – climate change and family violence portfolios respectively – having reached a “cooperation” agreement with the government. Under New Zealand’s MMP system, agreements between parties are common, particularly when no one party can form a government alone. In this case the agreement with the Greens was reached even though Labour did not need them to govern. Ardern said all the positions were assigned on merit. “I think one of the amazing things about New Zealand is that we are often in a space now where all of these questions (about diversity) often become secondary,” she said. “The representation is there. And that is not the first consideration.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1517,Keir Starmer says lockdown delay in England will cost lives,11/2/20,"Keir Starmer has said the government’s delay in calling a second coronavirus lockdown in England will cost lives and singled out Rishi Sunak for blame, saying the UK chancellor’s “name is all over” the decision to reject earlier tough measures. In a speech to the annual conference of the CBI, the Labour leader said that while it would be wrong to blame the government for Covid, “I do blame it for the way it’s been handled – and I can’t forgive the catalogue of mistakes that have cost lives and livelihoods.” In the middle of last month, Starmer called for a two-week “circuit breaker” for England to curb the spread of the virus, and coinciding with the half-term holiday for schools. It followed the publication of documents that showed that the government’s scientific advisers had called for such a lockdown in September. Ministers rejected this, but changed course on Friday after forecasts indicated that without further action the number of Covid deaths over the winter could significantly exceed those in the first peak. Addressing the CBI – Boris Johnson had also been due to address the business organisation on Monday, but pulled out to focus on a Commons statement about the new plan – Starmer said that when the scientists recommended the circuit breaker, on 21 September, there were slightly more than 4,000 daily infections and 11 deaths.
“Forty days later, when [the PM] finally decided to announce a longer, four-week national lockdown, those figures had increased to 326 deaths a day, and 22,000 Covid cases. That is the human cost of the government’s inaction,” Starmer said. In a direct attack on Sunak, he added: “The impact on business, and jobs, will be severe. Make no mistake, the chancellor’s name is all over this. His decision to block a circuit breaker, to dismiss it as a ‘blunt instrument’ and to pretend that you can protect the economy without controlling the virus will now mean that businesses have to close for longer, more people will lose their jobs, and the public finances will be worse than they needed to be. “It makes me so angry and so frustrated that when the British people – and British businesses – have given so much and made so many sacrifices, they have been let down so badly by the government.” Starmer said Sunak needed to also address parliament on Monday, to fully explain the package of support for businesses and employees during the new lockdown, which begins on Thursday and is due to last for four weeks. He said: “One of the things I’ve learned from this crisis is that it exposes leadership like nothing else. On that count the prime minister and the chancellor have failed. They failed to learn. They failed to listen. And they failed to lead. The result is tragic – but all too predictable.”
The Labour leader also castigated Johnson for potentially failing to reach a full Brexit trade deal with the EU, bringing the possibility that the chaos of a winter Covid peak could be exacerbated by full departure on 31 December without a final deal. “The prime minister said he would get one,” Starmer said. “In fact, he said he had one. So he should get on with it. Stop fuelling uncertainty at the worst possible time and secure the deal he promised.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1518,Labour to avoid revolt by voting against overseas operations bill,11/2/20,"Labour is gearing up to vote against the overseas operations bill in the Commons on Tuesday, to halt a damaging run of rebellions at a time when the party is in turmoil following the suspension of Jeremy Corbyn. Writing in the Guardian, John Healey, the party’s shadow defence secretary, described the bill as “dishonest and damaging” and said it was “not in the best interests of British troops, British justice or British military standing in the world”. Labour sources indicated that the party would abandon its previous policy of abstaining should the amendments it was supporting fail, and oppose the bill at its third and final Commons reading. Critics argue the bill effectively legalises torture and war crimes by soldiers serving abroad because it introduces an effective five-year time limit to criminal prosecutions to almost all crimes for soldiers serving overseas. Healey wrote that he believed the government’s approach “risks the international criminal court acting to put British forces personnel on trial in the Hague if the UK justice system won’t”. Last month, three of Labour junior shadow ministers were sacked after joining Corbyn and 14 other MPs from the party in the division lobby by voting against, when the leadership had called for an abstention. It was the first of three human rights-related rebellions against the party leadership, including two others on the covert human intelligence sources bill, the last of which attracted 34 rebels, the largest rebellion since Keir Starmer took over as leader. Andrew Scattergood, the co-chair of the party pressure group Momentum, which had been campaigning on the bill, said Labour’s leadership had “done the right thing” but added: “They have only done so because of concerted pressure from Labour members and left MPs. This is a vindication of their principled opposition.” Those on the left believe that Labour’s tactic of repeated abstention had been designed to “provoke leftwing resignations” – including the subsequent departures of Dan Carden and Margaret Greenwood at the most recent rebellion. The party faces a greater crisis following the suspension of Corbyn, who had said the scale of Labour’s antisemitism problem “was also dramatically overstated for political reasons” in the aftermath of a scathing EHRC investigation. Focus is expected to switch to amendments put down by the Conservative MP David Davis and Labour’s Dan Jarvis, which aims to ensure that torture and related offences would not be covered by the five-year limit. The amendments have been supported by five Conservative MP, including former cabinet ministers Davis and Andrew Mitchell, as well as Crispin Blunt, Ian Liddell-Grainger and Pauline Latham. “I am very concerned about the reciprocal danger to our soldiers if the government does not take a strong line,” Mitchell said. The government – bringing the concluding stage of the bill in the run-up to Armistice Day this Sunday – says the bill is necessary to prevent soldiers from being affected by vexatious claims. A defence source added: “Whilst it is admirable that Labour have this time chosen to fall down on one side or another of the vote – instead of sitting on the fence – they’ve unfortunately chosen the side that confirms their long-held disdain for armed forces personnel.”",,Politics,Guardian,4
1519,Labour urges UK trade secretary to end delays over Kenya and Ghana deals,11/2/20,"The Labour party has urged the UK trade secretary, Liz Truss, to end delays over rollover deals with Kenya and Ghana to prevent them being slapped with high tariffs when the UK leaves the EU on 1 January. Negotiations with Kenya and Ghana have yet to be signed off with only nine weeks to go before the UK’s transition deal with the EU comes to an end, when import charges would be imposed on goods worth £2.6bn from the African countries. Labour officials fear Truss is trying to drive a hard bargain with individual nations that depend on foreign income from sales of bananas, cocoa and flowers to the UK to make up for deals that largely favour foreign imports. With EU trade talks hanging in the balance and discussions with the US barely started, the trade department signed a deal with Japan last month that the shadow trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, warned massively favoured the world’s third-largest economy. Shadow trade minister Gareth Thomas said in a letter to Truss that he was concerned that the department’s attention had switched from talks with the East African Community (EAC) trade bloc to bilateral deals with individual countries. He said that the failure to sign deals with Kenya and Ghana had left them unable to plan for next year and, worse, the current proposals left them facing duties on exports to the UK. “The terms of the continuity agreements you have been proposing would lead to new barriers to trade between both Ghana and her neighbours in the Economic Community of West African States [ECOWAS] and similarly would adversely affect trade between Kenya and other developing countries in the EAC.
“The UK has a record of supporting regional trade integration through DfID-backed programmes such TradeMark East Africa and I would be keen to understand how, in your view, putting at risk vital trade flows between some of the poorest countries in the world is compatible with such programmes?” A government spokesman said: “Ghana and Kenya’s economic potential is huge and we continue to work closely with these African nations to ensure trade continuity for businesses following the transition period. “Our ongoing discussions demonstrate our commitment to increasing trade with developing countries, which can ultimately help to remove barriers, reduce poverty, create more jobs and boost economic growth.”",,Politics,Guardian,4
1520,Latest coronavirus lockdowns spark protests across Europe,11/2/20,"Fresh lockdowns to stem the spread of coronavirus have sparked sometimes violent protests in several European countries, fuelled both by ideological fury at new government-imposed restrictions and fears of economic hardship. As the number of infections surge and hospitals and intensive care units fill up, countries including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain have once more introduced tough curbs on movement and gatherings. But the measures are stirring resistance, not just among libertarians who see them as an assault on personal freedom and conspiracy theorists who say the virus is a hoax, but from business owners and independent workers worried for their future. The protests suggest mounting dissatisfaction with governments’ responses to the pandemic and, amid a growing realisation that it will last for some time yet, alarm at the economic consequences even in countries such as Germany and France, where generous economic safety nets are functioning relatively well.
Italy, one of the hardest-hit EU countries this spring, has been the scene of violent protests for more than a week as the government brought in new measures including closing cinemas and theatres and ordering bars and restaurants to shut at 6pm. There have been skirmishes between police and protesters in Florence and other cities, including Rome, Naples, Turin and Bologna, with clashes between riot officers firing teargas and demonstrators hurling Molotov cocktails, bottles and rocks and overturning bins. The government is working towards yet tougher measures that could include a national 9pm curfew, a ban on inter-regional travel and the closure of shopping malls at weekends to try to slow an alarming rise in daily infections. The interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, said this weekend the protests involved “violent fringe elements” including football hooligans, far-right activists and neo-fascists trying to “exploit the social and economic discomfort of this difficult moment”. But while polls show a majority of Italians support the latest restrictions, and the government has promised €5bn for the worst-hit professions including restaurants, taxi drivers and entertainment venues, peaceful protests by small business owners have also multiplied across the country. Slogans brandished by demonstrators have included “Work is our right” and “If you close us down, you pay up.” Government compensation “doesn’t always arrive”, a Milan businessman told Agence France-Presse, and is “obviously not enough for the many who work wholly or partly in the informal economy. The winter will be hard.”
In Spain, which has has imposed a nationwide night-time curfew and implemented regional border closures, anger spilled on to the streets on Saturday for the second night running, with looting and vandalism breaking out in some cities. Thirty-two people were arrested and 12 injured in Madrid after a protest over the region’s midnight to 6am curfew turned violent, and there were also demonstrations over the weekend in Barcelona, Málaga, Vitoria, Valencia, Santander and Burgos. The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, called for an end to “violent and irrational behaviour” by a minority. The protests have involved far-left and far-right groups, with the leader of the far-right Vox party, Santiago Abascal, saying there were “more reasons than ever to protest against this government, which is ruining us”.
Police in Belgium, which announced a second lockdown on Friday, broke up an unauthorised anti-lockdown protest in Brussels a few days earlier, while in Berlin, a crowd of about 2,000 including far-right activists and anti-vaxxers joined a rally last Monday demanding an end to all coronavirus restrictions. “We are here and we are loud because we are being robbed of our freedom,” the marchers chanted. The same day, an attempted arson attack was reported against the national disease control and prevention agency, the Robert Koch Institute, while on Wednesday thousands of artists and entertainment workers demanded more support.
The chancellor, Angela Merkel, announcing a new “soft lockdown” from Monday with bars, cinemas and theatres closed and cafes and restaurants allowed only takeaway service from Monday, described people arguing Covid-19 as dangerous and irresponsible, but said the government expected to face similar “protests and, let’s say … incomprehension” for some time to come. In France, which has also entered a second, more relaxed lockdown, small protests numbering no more than 100 or so marked the occasion on Thursday night in several cities including Paris and Toulouse. In Castres, about 80km east of Toulouse, local shopkeepers brandished a banner reading: “Upright today; on our knees tomorrow”.
Shopkeepers have complained about being forced to close while supermarkets, because they also sell food, are allowed to sell “non-essential goods” such as shoes, clothes and beauty products. In a gesture of appeasement, the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said on Monday that supermarkets would face the same limits on selling non-essential goods, but insisted shop owners may not challenge the lockdown rules. Officials have said European economies, already devastated by lockdowns in March, April and May, will take a further hit from the second series of closures, even though the new measures are mostly not as strict and many companies are better equipped to deal with them. Le Maire said last week he expected France’s economic activity to fall by 15% during the new lockdown, about half the downturn it suffered this spring. But economists have warned consumer behaviour in particular is likely to be dampened by the fear of further lockdowns before life returns to normal sometime next year.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1521,New Zealanders coming home for Christmas warned isolation hotels may be full,11/2/20,"New Zealand’s isolation hotels are approaching capacity as the military warns there may not be room to house Kiwis planning to return home for Christmas. Some 65,000 people have passed through New Zealand’s isolation accommodation since the borders closed in mid-March. Despite the facilities generally being four- and five-star establishments, there have been numerous escape attempts from them, and they have been denounced by a conservative US television host as “Covid camps”. Now seven weeks out from Christmas, Air Commodore Darryn Webb, who is charged with overseeing the management of the hotels, has warned that many Kiwis will be disappointed if they haven’t prebooked their Christmas travels as the isolation accommodation available for that period is nearly at capacity.
This comes as a new system beginning Tuesday requires returning New Zealanders to have booked a place in a managed isolation facility in advance of boarding a flight home. Since the March border closure, all arrivals have had to isolate for 14 days in one of these government-overseen isolation hotels until they test negative twice for Covid-19, on days three and 12 of their stay. There are also quarantine hotels, where arrivals testing positive for Covid-19, or with symptoms or recent contact with a suspected carrier, must stay for 14 days. “Our message to people is ‘no voucher – no fly’,” said Webb. “If you don’t have a voucher, do not go to the airport because you will not be allowed to board a plane to New Zealand without one.” “We’re already starting to see some periods where we’re booked solid,” Webb said. “There is a finite number of rooms available. New Zealanders can still come home but anyone wanting to come home in the lead-up to the Christmas holiday period needs to make their travel plans early or they may not be able to come home on their preferred dates.” The warning comes as public health experts criticise the management of the border, as another community case stemming from an isolation hotel emerged late yesterday. The positive test was returned on Sunday by a staff member working at the Sudima hotel, near Christchurch airport, where international fishing crews are staying. Of the 237 mariners in the hotel, 31 are infected with Covid-19. The Sudima worker is now in isolation at home. Public health specialist Professor Nick Wilson said the cycle of infection from across the border had to be stopped. “We’ve had six border failures since the start of August – and that includes the large Auckland August outbreak – so things are definitely not working properly,” Wilson told Radio New Zealand. Wilson said people in isolation at Sudima were sharing rooms, which was a breach of normal quarantine practice, and other hotels had “shared airspace” and unsuitable ventilation systems. “It’s not adequate that workers are being placed at risk … this is an area that needs an urgent review.”
But director-general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, disagreed that it was a border security failure: “This is another example of the system working well to protect our border. People don’t enter the New Zealand community until they finish quarantine after 14 days.” The practise of double-bunking would, however, be reviewed before the arrival of another charter flight carrying foreign fishing crew. The flight has been delayed due to the worker’s positive test and availability of space at the hotel. Unite union president Gerard Hehir said there may have to be an increase in quarantine times for large groups of international workers, and more testing for hotel workers. “We’ve got to look after those workers ... not just in terms of their health. These are low-paid workers, so the risks they’re taking, we need to make sure that they are not under pressure to, for instance, not isolate because they might lose money.” New Zealand has 81 active Covid cases. Its total number of cases is 1,607 including 25 deaths. • This article was amended on 3 November 2020.

1522,Pakistan's plan to make disputed region a fifth province angers India,11/2/20,"Pakistan and India have been drawn into a fresh dispute following an announcement by the Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, that he will provisionally declare the border territory of Gilgit-Baltistan the country’s fifth province. The strategic area bordering China and Afghanistan forms part of Pakistan-administered Kashmir – an area claimed by Pakistan and India, but controlled by Pakistan since the war of independence in 1947. Gilgit-Baltistan, for decades ruled by Pakistan’s central government, has no representative in the federal parliament and cannot bring cases to the supreme court, but making it a provisional province gives the region stronger constitutional and voting rights, more local autonomy and increased powers for its legislative assembly. “Administrative, political and economic reforms are a longstanding demand of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan,” said a statement by the Pakistan government. For the state to officially become Pakistan’s fifth province, it would require an amendment to the constitution. India, which claims sovereignty over the entire state of Kashmir, responded vehemently to the announcement by Khan, stating that it “categorically rejects” the move. India’s ministry of external affairs said “so-called Gilgit-Baltistan” was Indian territory and the declaration of the region as a Pakistan province was an attempt to camouflage an “illegal and forcible occupation” of the area.
The announcement by Khan is the latest escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan over the troubled territory of Kashmir. In August last year, India infuriated Pakistan by removing the special semi-autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir – the part of the Kashmir region that falls on the Indian side of the border – and bringing the state fully under the control of the Indian government for the first time since partition. The announcement by Khan also came less than a month before the 2 million people of Gilgit-Baltistan are to go to the polls for their legislative assembly, which currently has very limited powers. The move has been seen as a clear attempt by the prime minister to win over voters at a time when the popularity of Khan’s ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) is in severe decline amid economic collapse, record levels of inflation and increasingly united political opposition. Many in the region viewed the announcement with scepticism and it was seen by some as a half measure, without committing to enshrining the change in the constitution. Naveed Saleem, a student in Gilgit-Baltistan, said: “Khan is bluffing. This provisional status is not what we asked for. It still wouldn’t make Gilgit-Pakistan a constitutional part of Pakistan. We still can’t vote for the prime minister of Pakistan. We still can’t go to supreme court of Pakistan. It’s a joke.” Shaan Mohammed Khan, an IT expert from the state, was similarly mistrustful. “Without a constitutional change, Imran Khan’s words mean nothing,” he said. “As general elections are near they are doing this only to increase their vote bank.” The move is one that will particularly satisfy Pakistan’s close ally China. Beijing has been pushing for more stability and security for Gilgit-Baltistan as the region forms a crucial part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), an infrastructure project running through Pakistan, which is the flagship of Xi Jinping’s belt and road initiative. “Given the depth of India-Pakistan tensions, this will certainly raise temperatures even more,” said Michael Kugelman, the deputy director of the Asia Program and a senior associate for south Asia at the Wilson Center. “Pakistan has sought to make this change for quite some time, and with both Pakistan-India and India-China relations in deep crisis, the timing makes sense from a geopolitical context,” added Kugelman. “It’s an opportunity to push back against New Delhi on two fronts: it delivers a blow to its claim to Gilgit-Baltistan, and it gives some momentum to a CPEC enterprise that India opposes.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1523,PM moves to stop Tory mutiny with vote on England lockdown extension,11/2/20,"Boris Johnson has been forced to quell a rising Conservative mutiny over England’s new national lockdown by pledging to give MPs the chance to block any extension beyond 2 December. Tory MPs said they had been “spooked” by suggestions from ministers that the four-week lockdown could be extended should the infection rate remain high. Senior MPs have asked to see the full economic impact assessment given to the cabinet before they vote on the new restrictions on Wednesday. On Monday, Conservative whips, government scientists and Johnson increased their private efforts to contain any rebellion, in what one MP called a “day of propaganda”. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also intensified his attacks on the government’s decision to delay a national lockdown – and blamed the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, for blocking an earlier “circuit breaker”, which Starmer said could have saved lives.
“Forty days later, when [the prime minister] finally decided to announce a longer, four-week national lockdown … figures had increased to 326 deaths a day, and 22,000 Covid cases. That is the human cost of the government’s inaction,” Starmer told the CBI conference. In a direct attack on Sunak, he added: “The impact on business, and jobs, will be severe. Make no mistake, the chancellor’s name is all over this.” Labour will back the new restrictions, meaning the government will not risk losing the vote. But there are fears in Downing Street about the potential embarrassment of any future vote depending on Labour support to pass, if enough Conservatives decide to rebel. Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, who is likely to vote against the government, said: “I think it is essential that the government should publish a full impact assessment of its proposed lockdown before MPs are asked to vote on Wednesday. “We know from experience that lockdowns don’t defeat the virus, they merely defer its spread, and the cost is substantial in terms of jobs destroyed, businesses that will fail, mental health – especially for the young – and other health consequences which mean lockdowns cost lives as well as saving them.” Charles Walker, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee, predicted there would be just 15 Conservative rebels for the vote but said there was “huge disquiet on the Conservative benches”, which could cause issues later down the line. “I will be voting against the legislation on Wednesday because I’m fed up of having decent people criminalised,” he said. “But I expect the whips’ office will pick off a number of other heretics to make sure they are at worst abstaining or even better, in the government lobby supporting them.” One Tory MP from the former Labour heartland “red wall” areas, said despite deep scepticism they planned to back the new lockdown. “I just honestly don’t see what the alternative is. I hate it, it’s awful, but what else can you do? I think a lot of colleagues feel like that. “Going forward, we need to see more of the data and scientific advice they look at and accept or reject in the decision-making process. What are the economic impact projections that they consider? How are the decisions actually made?” One MP, who has not rebelled previously on Covid-19 legislation, said a vote to extend the lockdown could be “bruising” for the government unless there was “seriously convincing evidence that there was no other alternative”. MPs will get a vote on what replaces the lockdown restrictions before they expire on 2 December. “The intention of the government is to go back to the tier system on a local and regional basis,” Johnson’s spokesman said.
Should the R (reproduction) number continue to be above 1, Johnson will be under pressure to continue the harsh restrictions. The spokesman said the government would examine the data throughout the four-week lockdown. “We believe the package of measures is tough enough to get the R … down again and allow us to go down to that regional approach,” he said. Earlier on Monday, Sunak refused to rule out the coronavirus lockdown lasting longer than its intended four weeks, a reiteration of what his cabinet colleague Michael Gove said over the weekend. Speaking in the Commons, Johnson sought to persuade mutinous Conservative backbenchers to support his plan for a new coronavirus lockdown across England, saying that failing to act now would risk the “medical and moral disaster” of an overwhelmed NHS. The prime minister also rejected the idea he had been too slow to act, saying it had been right to first try a regional system of different tiers of restrictions.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1524,Reform UK: Brexit party to rebrand as anti-lockdown voice,11/2/20,"The Brexit party has applied to the Electoral Commission to change its name to Reform UK in a bid to rebrand the party, which has no elected representatives, as a voice in the anti-lockdown movement. The party’s leader, Nigel Farage, and chairman, Richard Tice, first announced the plan in a joint article in the Telegraph where they wrote it was “time to redirect our energies”. The name change is subject to approval of the commission. The Brexit party gained 2% of the vote in the 2019 general election, and none of the 275 candidates it stood won a seat. Prior to the December election, Farage had announced the party would change its name following the UK’s exit from the European Union and focus on campaigning for changes in the electoral system. In a statement on Sunday announcing the plans to rebrand the party, Farage said: “As promised, we continue to keep a very close eye on the government’s trade negotiations with the EU, to ensure a proper Brexit. Further reform in many other areas is also vital for our nations’ future.” Tice added: “The need for major reform in the UK is clearer now than ever. A new approach is essential, so that government works for the people, not for itself.” He said that a new strategy was needed for tackling the coronavirus so that “we learn to live with it, not hide in fear of it”. The idea of ending the Covid pandemic through herd immunity was recently denounced as “a dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence”, by 80 researchers who wrote a warning letter in a leading medical journal. The Brexit party announcement comes as England prepares to enter a four-week nationwide lockdown on 5 November, a decision which has angered some Tory MPs, with prominent backbenchers including Sir Graham Brady warning they are likely to vote against the new restrictions. MPs will vote on the second lockdown on Wednesday as experts warn that the daily death toll could reach as high as 4,000 by Christmas if swift action is not taken. Announcing the decision on Saturday evening, Boris Johnson said that if nothing is done the country faced a “peak of mortality” worse than that of the first wave in April.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1525,Rishi Sunak refuses to rule out extended lockdown in England,11/2/20,"Rishi Sunak has refused to rule out the new coronavirus lockdown lasting longer than its intended four weeks, as one of the scientists advising the government said delays in imposing tougher restrictions were likely to have cost thousands of lives. Asked whether he could guarantee the lockdown across England, which begins on Thursday, would be lifted as planned on 2 December, the UK chancellor was less definitive. “Our expectation and firm hope, on the basis of everything we know today, is the measures we have put in place for the time they will be in place for, will be sufficient to do the job we need, and we will seek to exit these restrictions back into a tiered approach at the end of the four-week period,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
Asked whether, even if the toughest restrictions were lifted over Christmas, this would not be followed again by a rolling series of national lockdowns over the rest of the winter, Sunak again said only that his “hope and expectation” was the four-week period would be sufficient. Boris Johnson will make a Commons statement on the new plan on Monday afternoon, amid a mutinous mood among some Conservative MPs, both about the new lockdown and the government’s wider handling of the crisis. The prime minister had been due to address the CBI annual conference this week, but has now reportedly withdrawn. Sunak defended the government’s delay in imposing national restrictions, despite its scientific advisers advising in September that ministers should impose a two-week “circuit breaker” to limit the spread of infections, something Labour subsequently also called for. “We’re dealing with a virus that has clearly moved at a pace faster than we had anticipated or feared,” he said. “It’s the last thing we wanted to do, bring in such restrictive measures.” He added: “If you think back to a few weeks ago, I firmly believe that the right approach was a regional, tiered approach. I think the evidence supported that,” Speaking earlier on Today, Andrew Hayward, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London, who is a member of the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group, (Nervtag), which advises ministers, said the delay would have severe consequences for both health and the economy. Hayward, who was among the scientists who sought an early circuit-breaker, but was speaking on Today in a personal capacity, said the government had “repeatedly underestimated Covid and done too little, too late”. He said: “We can’t turn back the clock but I think if we had chosen a two-week circuit break at that time [in mid-September], we would definitely have saved thousands of lives, and we would clearly have inflicted substantially less damage on our economy than the proposed four-week lockdown will do.” This could be said with a “high degree of certainty”, Hayward said: “We know that this sort of measure, whereby we shut down multiple areas of transmission at the same time. is the single most effective way of stopping the virus from spreading. And we know very clearly that the earlier you do that, the more lives you will save. “Waiting to see if less intense measures are going to work is really quite a dangerous way of doing things.” Asked whether schools should have also been shut for the new lockdown, Hayward said that given the extent of coronavirus transmission in secondary schools, not doing so would require a longer national closure. Speaking to Sky News, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said the party supported schools remaining open, but had sought a lockdown to coincide with the just-ended half term so as to boost its effectiveness. Ashworth castigated the government for dismissing the idea of a half-term circuit breaker: “They told us in the Labour party we were opportunistic, and came on shows like yours and ridiculed us. “The consequence of that delay is we are now on the eve of a longer lockdown, and a more restrictive lockdown than perhaps would have been necessary had we just done that short circuit break earlier.” In his interview, Sunak said there were “reasons for cautious optimism” about Covid in the longer term, citing better treatments for the virus, research on vaccines, and the approach of mass testing.
On testing, he declined to commit to measures that could improve compliance with people self-isolating, such as higher or more widespread statutory sick pay. Sunak said support for self-employed people would be boosted during the lockdown, along with the extension of the furlough scheme for those in jobs.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1526,Subdued Johnson just a piece of flotsam being buffeted around | John Crace,11/2/20,"Looking on the bright side for the prime minister, he didn’t have any more credibility to lose. As a rule of thumb, you can pretty much guarantee that for everything that Boris Johnson says, the opposite will turn out to be true. As with Brexit, so it is for the coronavirus. In March, he insisted the virus would be defeated in 12 weeks. That went well. In July, Boris promised the country would be back to normal by Christmas. No one’s putting any money on that now. In his statement to the Commons on the latest national lockdown, Johnson insisted the virus would be beaten by March. He didn’t say what year. It’s hard to know which is the more bewildering: the fact that we have a prime minister who is both incompetent and unable to distinguish between fact and fiction; or that there are so many Conservative MPs who are consistently taken aback by the failings of their leader. You would have thought by now it would have been 203 times bitten, 204 times shy. But no. They continue to cut him some slack, albeit increasingly grumpily; as if they are as surprised as anyone that Johnson has failed to deliver on his promises and each time insist he is now on a final warning. Something has to change, they warn. But it never does. Johnson was in the Commons to give the statement he had already been forced to give at Saturday’s Downing Street press conference after details of the national lockdown agreed between him, Rishi Sunak, Michael Gove and Matt Hancock had been mysteriously leaked to the papers the night before. Not that it was a national lockdown, mind, because Boris had promised there would not be another national lockdown. Rather it was a lockdown that would be imposed nationally, albeit with schools and universities remaining more or less open.
This was a subdued Boris. Even by his own standards, this latest U-turn was a humiliation. An admission that he has not just lost control of the coronavirus, he’s lost control of the government. He’s just a piece of flotsam being buffeted around. Not that it stopped him lying, of course. Just that the lies have become progressively more feeble, as if even he has stopped the pretence of believing them. He began by stating that the government had had to change course because the scientific data had changed on Saturday. The chief scientific adviser and chief medical officer had actually given their latest briefing to the cabinet well before that, which was why the lockdown had been agreed on Friday. Sage had called for a “circuit breaker” back in September and had been clear a tiered series of regional lockdowns were going to be insufficient to contain the spread of the virus. But Boris didn’t want to upset his more libertarian MPs, so he decided to kill a few more people instead. Besides it would have been shameless opportunism to introduce a lockdown any sooner. For weeks now, Johnson has been dismissively referring to Keir Starmer as Captain Hindsight. Now he was tacitly forced to admit the Labour leader was Captain Foresight and that he was General Hopelessness. Because the measures that Boris was introducing were ones which Starmer had been demanding for the best part of a month. Something which Keir was not slow to point out. The new lockdown was both harder and longer than the one Labour had proposed and less likely to succeed. With Labour having promised Johnson the necessary votes on Wednesday, most of the rest of the session was a free for all with the prime minister as the fall guy. A lot of the flak came as friendly fire. Tory Brexiters hadn’t fought to close borders only to curtail every Englishman’s right to go into any pub they wanted to get Covid-19. Just as long as the virus wasn’t caught from Johnny Foreigner then all was tickety-boo. You could die happy knowing the virus had spread from a Brit. Why bother flying to Zurich, when you can turn the whole of the UK into a Dignitas hub? Who knows, it could turn out to be a huge money-spinner? The longer the session went on, the more confused Johnson’s answers became. He was adamant the country would return to regional lockdowns on 2 December, even though he could give no guarantees the rate of infection would have come down sufficiently over the course of the next month. He guessed it would be down to parliament what happened next, he said unhappily. So that was a yes and a no. “The country wants politicians to act together,” he shrugged sadly, apparently unaware of his own failure to act on scientific evidence and work with Labour a month ago – and of the fact that the MPs least inclined to work together were his own. Some wanted golf courses reopened, others were happy to compromise on pitch and putt. The DUP’s Sammy Wilson said that he had come to hear Churchill but had only got Halifax-style appeasement instead. What became more and more evident the longer the session went on was that Boris was out of ideas. Other than to do too little too late. He wasn’t even sure what he had and hadn’t promised Scotland by way of bailout. Starmer slumped back in his seat. He knew what we all knew: that we would be back in the Commons on 2 December with little change in the nation’s health, to have the same arguments over lockdowns and the failure of test and trace all over again. You can cancel Christmas now.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1527,T-cell Covid immunity 'present in adults six months after first infection',11/2/20,"Cellular (T-cell) immunity against the virus that causes Covid-19 is likely to be present within most adults six months after primary infection, with levels considerably higher in patients with symptoms, a study suggests. The data offers another piece of the puzzle that could be key to understanding whether previous Sars-CoV-2 infections – the virus behind Covid-19 – can prevent reinfection, and if so, for how long. The study, led by the UK coronavirus immunology consortium, evaluated 100 non-hospitalised healthcare workers in March and April after antibody responses were detected in them. It is yet to be peer-reviewed. It is the first study to offer data on T-cell levels six months after infection in people with mild or asymptomatic disease that is likely to represent the majority of infections, the authors say.
The results of the study are likely to be viewed positively, after previous studies suggested antibody levels can decline within the first few months post-infection. Data released from a 100,000-person sample in August indicated about 6% of the population of England had antibodies – proteins produced in response to an infection – but antibody levels dropped by more than a quarter in three months, researchers revealed in late October. Once the virus enters the body, it is greeted by a cavalry of cells that mount a counterattack that is swift, broad and generic. This so-called innate immune system is meant to arrest the infection in its tracks. If that mission is foiled, it buys time until the “experts” show up. These experts constitute two types of white blood cells: B-cells and T-cells, that work like brothers-in-arms. If the virus makes it past the initial assault, some T-cells are slayers, annihilating respiratory cells the pathogen has colonised. Meanwhile, helper T-cells take on a supportive role – including stimulating B-cells to produce molecules called antibodies that render the virus immobile or thwart it from penetrating other cells. The adaptive system also retains memory – but in the case of Covid-19, it is unclear how much and for how long. After being tracked for six months, researchers found that every person had detectable T-cell levels, and levels were 50% higher in people who had experienced symptoms at the time of infection. This could mean that either there will be more protection in people with more severe initial disease, or conversely, that people with asymptomatic disease are able to control the virus with lower levels of T-cells, they said. A bigger set of patients would be tracked for a longer time period to a get a better sense of cellular immunity, given that T-cells could survive for long periods, said one of the study’s authors, Paul Moss, a professor at the University of Birmingham. The authors also saw that T-cells levels were strongly correlated with the peak level of the antibody response. Cellular immune responses could even help to protect against the decline in antibody levels over time, they added. Overall, the results offer evidence that T-cell immunity may last longer than antibodies – but whether these persistent T-cells offer protection against reinfection remains unclear. “I think this data is reassuring, potentially even encouraging — but it does not mean that people cannot get reinfected,” Moss said. “We now need large-scale population studies to show how the antibody and cellular profiles act together to protect people over time.” In the study, some people lost detectable levels of antibodies. But that did not mean that B-cells, which make antibodies, were not around to spring into action if challenged again, the authors explained.
Ideally, testing for B-cells and T-cells in the community would provide a conclusive idea of how much the antibody response was actually predicting large-scale immunity, and whether there were people who did not have antibodies but were protected by cellular immunity, cautioned the author Shamez Ladhani, a consultant epidemiologist for Public Health England. “But at the moment, there is little evidence to suggest that there is widespread cell-mediated immunity without an antibody response.” Paul Morgan, a professor at Cardiff University, who was not involved in the study, said: “The work provides a welcome dose of optimism that Sars-CoV2 infection (and immunisation?) can induce a robust and sustained protective immune response, although this does not yet prove immunity to further infections which will require longer-term surveillance and larger cohorts.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1528,The lockdown rebels preparing to defy No 10 on Covid restrictions,11/2/20,"As England braces for a second national lockdown, Downing Street once more faces a rebellion over tougher restrictions. Ahead of a Commons vote on Wednesday, several Conservative MPs are weighing up their options. Here are some key figures who may line up against the government and the broad camps they sit in, alongside Nigel Farage and his plan for a new anti-lockdown party. The hawks Sir Graham Brady The chair of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs is again a thorn in the side of the government, urging Boris Johnson to publish a full impact assessment on the costs and benefits of another lockdown. “We need clarity as to the years of life that will be lost or saved, the impact on mental health and the consequences for quality of life,” he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. Brady, who successfully spearheaded a rebellion ensuring parliament got a vote on new nationwide restrictions before they are imposed, says any return to regional tiers or an extension of lockdown beyond 2 December must be approved in advance by MPs. Reflecting on restrictions over the past seven months, Brady added: “If a totalitarian regime sought to tell people with whom they are allowed to have sex (you must be in an established relationship), whether you are allowed to visit your parents, or which categories of workers are allowed to provide for their families, we would denounce it as intolerable evil.” Sir John Redwood The former Conservative cabinet minister has publicly questioned what the exit strategy is for lockdown. Tweeting on Monday, Redwood said: “The proposed lockdown will be damaging to livelihoods and business. The government should work with business to allow more to stay open … Why won’t the government advisers and NHS management give us believable forecasts rather than hugely wide and some wild illustrations of worst cases? Where are the accurate figures for NHS bed occupancy? How do they now define a CV 19 death?” The regional-lockdown pushers Iain Duncan Smith The former Tory party leader believes England should have kept with the regional tiered lockdown strategy. “Trying, as far as possible, to keep the economy open whilst focusing on those areas with the highest infection rates wasn’t a perfect solution, but it kept people’s hopes up. Now those hopes have been dashed,” he wrote for the Daily Mail. “I still feel, after seeing the Sage data, that we should have stuck with this plan – even increasing, if necessary, the levels of action in specific areas, as is now happening in Scotland. It seems harsh to punish the whole of England when many areas could be at tier levels which might well bring this under control.” Regarding Wednesday’s vote, he said: “I will need to be certain that the data is fair and accurate, leaving no other alternative, before supporting such a drastic step as full lockdown.” Peter Bone The veteran backbencher said the government’s localised approach to lockdowns “made a lot of sense”, telling the BBC: “Lock down in areas where the disease is very bad, but not in other areas – don’t wreck other areas where it’s not necessary. And I’m not quite sure why we’ve abandoned that, because there’s lots of areas in the UK which don’t have a problem at the moment.” Bone, who has not decided how he will vote on Wednesday, highlighted concerns about another lockdown and called Brady’s suggestion that an impact assessment be published “very sensible”. The libertarians Nigel Farage The most openly anti-lockdown political voice is now coming from the former Ukip leader, who announced on Monday he was rebranding his later vehicle, the Brexit party, as Reform UK with an initial plan to seek an alternative path on Covid. In a Telegraph article this weekend, Farage formally supported the Great Barrington Declaration – the proposal from an international group of scientists to allow younger and healthy people to return to normal life, while shielding the more vulnerable. This has been disparaged by many epidemiologists, who say the idea of achieving “herd immunity” without a vaccine is unrealistic, not least given the doubts about how long Covid immunity lasts. With a general election years away, Farage seems likely at some point to rebrand Reform UK as a more general rightwing populist party, focusing on areas such as immigration, crime, and culture-war issues. Esther McVey The former cabinet minister has come out against a new lockdown, saying she will vote against the measure on Wednesday. McVey wrote on Instagram: “The ‘lockdown cure’ is causing more harm than Covid. The world can not be put on hold, and the government must stop pressing the pause and stop button for the whole nation on a whim, with all the disastrous effects this brings to our lives, livelihoods, health and relationships.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1529,"There's no alternative to lockdown, Boris Johnson tells MPs",11/2/20,"Boris Johnson has sought to persuade mutinous Conservative backbenchers to support his plan for a new coronavirus lockdown across England, saying that failing to act now would risk the “medical and moral disaster” of an overwhelmed NHS. Addressing the Commons about his plans for a four-week shutdown starting on Thursday, the prime minister also rejected the idea he had been too slow to act, saying it had been right to first try a regional system of different tiers of restrictions. But in response, Keir Starmer accused Johnson of consistently being “too slow and behind the curve” in his decisions on Covid, which amounted to a significant failure of leadership.
While Labour has pledged to back the new measures in the Commons, all but guaranteeing they will pass, a number of Conservatives have expressed opposition to the planned closure of hospitality businesses and most retail, among other temporary rules. But Johnson said scientific predictions about the “remorseless advance of this second wave” meant the lockdown was inevitable. “Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action, at a national level,” he told MPs. “I believe it was right to try every possible option to get this virus under control at a local level, with strong local action and strong local leadership. “And I reject any suggestion that we are somehow slower in taking measures than our European friends and partners.” Directly addressing the Tory malcontents, Johnson said: “To those in this house who believe we should resist further national measures, let me spell out the medical and moral disaster we face.” This would he said, lead the the “disaster” of the NHS being overwhelmed, affecting not just coronavirus patients, but those with other ailments and needs.
He said: “The sick would be turned away because there was no room in hospitals. That sacred principle of care for anyone who needs it, whoever they are, and wherever, whenever they need it, could be broken for the first time in our lives. “Doctors and nurses could be forced to choose which patients to treat, who would live and who would die.” In response, some MPs said they would vote against the measures on Wednesday. Charles Walker, the senior backbencher who represents Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, said a negative vote was his only way of dissenting “as we drift further in to an authoritarian, coercive state”. Another senior backbencher, Bernard Jenkin, said he would back “the bitter medicine” from the prime minister, saying: “Nobody has put forward a viable, immediate alternative that would avoid the overwhelming of the NHS.” Jenkin asked Johnson to commission a white paper to set out a “plan for living with coronavirus”, and called for a revamp of the test-and-trace system, including a new boss to replace Dido Harding. Johnson also sought to reassure his critics, saying support for self-employed people would be doubled from 40% to 80% of trading profits. This was, he said, not “the full-scale lockdown of March and April”, and he guaranteed parliament a vote on what happens next when the regulations expire on 2 December.
But Starmer – who had advocated a two-week “circuit-breaker” lockdown coinciding with the just-ended half term – said the delay meant the measures would need to be longer and tougher. “At every stage the prime minister has been too slow and behind the curve,” the Labour leader said. “At every stage, he has pushed away challenge, ignored advice and put what he hoped would happen ahead of what is happening. At every stage he has over-promised and under-delivered.” Starmer said Johnson’s decision to reject the advice from his scientific advisers in September that a circuit breaker was needed amounted to “a catastrophic failure of leadership and of judgment”.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1530,"UK's vaccine taskforce chief shared sensitive documents in US, report says",11/2/20,"Labour has asked the cabinet secretary to “undertake an urgent and swift investigation” into the vaccines taskforce chief after it was claimed she showed US financiers “official sensitive” government documents at a $200-a-head conference last week. Kate Bingham, the head of Britain’s vaccine taskforce, showed a detailed list of vaccines which the UK government is closely monitoring to a “premier webinar and networking event” for women in private equity hosted by a Massachusetts company, the Sunday Times claimed. Bingham, a venture capitalist married to the Conservative minister Jesse Norman, was appointed to the role by Boris Johnson in May and reports directly to him. She combines her job leading the vaccine taskforce with her role as managing director of SV Health Investors, a private equity firm. Government sources have suggested that the documents were already in the public domain and were incorrectly labelled by the government as “official sensitive”. The prime minister’s spokesman said: “As part of her role she was taking part in close discussions with a wide range of pharmaceutical and manufacturing firms.” According to a video of the event obtained by the newspaper, she showed financiers a detailed list of vaccines which the UK government was closely monitoring and could later invest in. Bingham said: “We haven’t necessarily signed contracts with all of them so far. But they’re all in our sights.”
Several of the vaccines are owned or funded by publicly traded companies. Bingham also described the types of vaccine to which the government will turn its attention next. The “sort of thing we need” for midway through next year, she said, were “oral, transdermal, even intranasal” — applied through the mouth, skin and nose. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, wrote to Simon Case on Monday asking for him to launch a swift inquiry. Among the questions Reeves has asked the cabinet secretary to address were whether any aspects of the information the chair of the UK government vaccine taskforce shared at this online conference were not already in the public domain; how the government might ensure that any unfair advantage given to participants or commercial delegates will be dealt with; and who in government was consulted before Bingham agreed to take part in the conference. She continued: “Precisely who is the current chair of the UK government vaccine taskforce accountable to? Under what UK government code of conduct does this role fall? Will the government publish which code of conduct this is and the full details of it to reassure public confidence? “What measures has government taken to both ensure transparency and prevent conflicts of interests or perceived conflicts of interest?” The government released a statement stating that they were addressing inaccuracies in Sunday’s report, without specifically identifying the alleged inaccuracies. “The fact of her appearance and the content of her presentation received approval from officials at the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy in line with the process governing such engagements. Bingham focused on publicly available information and said little that expert delegates at the conference could not deduce themselves,” the statement said.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1531,Voting opens in New Zealand's beloved Bird of the Year competition,11/2/20,"Normally on a post test-match Monday in New Zealand, the talk is all about the national rugby team’s latest performance. But this week, while the All Blacks’ destruction of the Wallabies was on everyones’ lips, there was another topic of conversation: birds. Voting began on Monday in the hotly contested and brutal election of New Zealand’s Bird Of The Year. What started 15 years ago as a modest promotion to draw attention to New Zealand’s native birds, many of which are endangered, has become a phenomenon. Back then an entry page in the NZ Forest & Bird magazine had to be ripped out, filled in and posted. Last year more than 40,000 votes were cast online.
As ever, heavyweight names are chiming in. Word is the Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, is backing the black petrel again this year. “She calls it the Bogan Bird because it dresses in black” says Laura Keown, spokesperson for Bird of the Year 2020. “It’s a cool bird because it faces a lot of threats. Due to its feeding habits it gets caught as bycatch by commercial and recreational fishers.” There’s been scandal and allegations of vote rigging. In 2008, the successful campaign to elect kakapo was accused by the takahe of accepting undeclared donations “from wealthy migratory birds living in Monaco.” Even the odd non-Kiwi gets hooked. “I’m so glad I’ve followed enough New Zealanders to start seeing #BirdOfTheYear posts in my timeline,” Mark Bessey, a software writer residing in Santa Barbara wrote on Twitter. “They’re bringing some much needed joy (and very weird-looking birds) to my Twitter experience.” Defending champ, the Hoiho, live and breed only in New Zealand. Their numbers have been heading downhill for 30 years and in 2019, only 165 nests were located. In the Māori language, hoiho means ‘noisy’, also an apt description of the social media debate about which bird should triumph. When Helen Clark, the country’s former prime minister, declared a few elections ago that she’d voted for the Hoiho, not everyone was thrilled. “Helen, you wot mate? Not gannets?,” responded and incredulous Michelle Langstone, campaign manager for the gannet and inventor of the hashtag #dammitgannet. “Gannets are magnificent! This is very disappointing.” Langstone, writer, actor, chip fanatic, won’t be driving the gannet campaign this time but Langstone is squarely in their corner. Put it down to the bruising nature of politics. “I am emotionally drained, and all elections give me hives,” she declared recently on Twitter. Pressed further, Langstone elaborated to The Guardian, “And I’ve realised nobody will ever vote for gannets, so I just love them on my own.” She is urging punters to cast all five of their votes for seabirds which she says are “largely overlooked in popularity contests, because they’re mostly offshore, and they smell, and they haven’t got fancy plumage, and many of them are not endangered. But they’re so heroic.” Keown puts the competition’s popularity down to the Kiwi sense of humour. “They enjoy the frivolity, the fun.”
But there is a serious side to proceedings. About 75% of land birds and 90% of seabirds are judged to be threatened or at risk of extinction. Their habitats are being destroyed or degraded by introduced predators, pollution, human development, and climate change. Recent Birds Of The Year include the plump wood pigeon, the Kererū, with its green, copper and white dreamcoat, that alpine thief, the Kea (it’ll steal your lunch and your bootlaces) and the Forrest Gump of the skies, the bar-tailed godwit which have just returned to New Zealand from Siberia, a non-stop flight of some 12,000 kilometres. No past winner has won again. There’s no rule against it, says Keown. “I think it’s just the heart of New Zealanders that they want to share the love.” Voting closes on 15 November.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1532,Whale sculpture stops Dutch train crashing into water,11/2/20,"A metro train that overran the stop blocks at a station outside Rotterdam has been left balancing 10 metres above ground on the plastic tail of a whale sculpture. The metro driver was reportedly able to free himself from the train without injury after the incident shortly after midnight on Monday morning. There were no passengers onboard. Maarten Struijs, who made the sculpture of two tails emerging from water beneath the elevated metro line, said he was surprised the sculpture had held together.
He said: “I could never have imagined it that way, but it saved the operator’s life. The damage is an afterthought. “I am amazed that it is so strong. When plastic has stood for 20 years, you don’t expect it to hold up a metro train.” The artwork was erected in 2002 by the De Akkers station in Spijkenisse on the outskirts of Rotterdam, in the Dutch province of South Holland. It is made of reinforced polyester. Its original name was Whale Tails – but within hours of the train incident the local authority renamed it Saved by a Whale’s Tale. The emergency services were seeking to secure the scene on Monday. “Given the complexity, this will take some time,” a spokesman for the Rotterdam-Rijnmond safety region said. “It will be quite an exercise to get that thing off and get it safe.” It was as yet unclear what caused the train to overrun the station. • This article was amended on 5 November 2020 to explain that the whale sculpture began life with a name different from the one hastily bestowed by the local authority after the train incident.",,Foreign,Guardian,4

1534,What is the science behind England's second national lockdown?,11/2/20,"England is preparing to enter a second national lockdown after scientific advisers warned that coronavirus infections and the numbers of people in hospital are rising steeply in many areas of the country. But what is the science behind the decision? What data prompted the lockdown? The prime minister and two leading advisers, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientist, and Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, made the case for a second national lockdown with a haul of data. They began with the rate of new infections, around 50,000 cases per day, according to the Office for National Statistics, but noted that an infection survey run by Imperial College, London, points to nearer 100,000 cases per day. They showed daily hospital admissions and deaths rising since the end of August. Medium-term projections from the modelling subgroup of the government’s scientific advisers, Sage, found that admissions could surpass those in the first wave by the end of November, with the death rate hitting 800 per day a week later. With no further action, hospital bed capacity would be overrun in December. How robust is the data? The data on infections and deaths is by no means perfect, but it was other data that caused most alarm. The advisers presented new modelling from several academic groups on the number of daily deaths England might expect from now until next summer. Many of the groups, such as Imperial College and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, predicted deaths rise to around 2,000 a day by the end of the year. Most striking was modelling from Cambridge University and Public Health England, which suggested 4,000 deaths per day in December. The figure has come under intense scrutiny which has highlighted the provisional nature of many modelling studies.
The Cambridge model differed from the others in important ways. While there are claims that the model looked at deaths 60 days after a positive test rather than the more common 28 days, this is incorrect. There is another reason the model was an outlier. The modelling, performed three weeks ago, used data on coronavirus deaths to infer how rife infections were when the people who died became infected some weeks earlier. This infection rate, and the consequent deaths, were then projected forwards to February. The approach meant that the model showed how the epidemic six or more weeks ago might look if it continued to rage unabated. This led to a substantial overestimation of daily deaths. Fed with recent data, the model is far more in line with the others Sage uses, with all estimating roughly 1,000 deaths per day by mid-December if no more is done to contain the virus. The models all point to the number of people in hospital and deaths exceeding those in the first wave without further action. What needs to happen in the next four weeks? Government science advisers called for an immediate “circuit breaker” in September to stop the epidemic spiralling out of control. The three-tier system that was brought in instead was known, even at the most stringent tier 3 level, to be insufficient to bring the R value below 1 and push infections down. The result is a far larger epidemic that will take longer to bring back under control. In the next four weeks, it will be crucial for people to follow the new guidelines, which aim to reduce the amount of contact people have with one another. Scientists will be watching the R value, estimated each week, to look for signs that it is falling, but also infection rates and hospital admissions.
How will scientists know if R is below 1? Researchers on the modelling subgroup of Sage use several data streams to estimate the national and regional R values. The number of new infections picked up by hospital and community tests, but also surveys run by the ONS and Imperial College, should be among the first to reveal whether infections are slowing. Other data also feed in though, from phone surveys that quiz people about the number of people they are in contact with, to mobility data compiled by Google and Facebook. Death rates will be the last to show any improvement: there may well be people infected this week who go on to die from Covid after the four weeks have passed. Pushing R below 1 means the epidemic is shrinking, but it is not the only consideration. Scientists will also be watching for the prevalence, or total number of cases, to fall. If the number of people infected drops substantially over lockdown, and if the remaining infections are in those who rarely need hospital treatment, the lockdown could be eased before R is brought below 1. What role will Sage have in the decision to ease lockdown? The Sage modelling subgroup reviews coronavirus data constantly and reaches a consensus each week about the R value and the growth rate of the epidemic. These are passed on to Sage for broader discussion. As with all policymaking, the decision on how and when to ease the lockdown will be for ministers rather than Sage, but the committee will submit proposals for the next steps. Primarily, the experts will want to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed and keep deaths down as winter comes. But other factors will feed into their advice, such as the state of NHS test and trace, and planning for people, including students, moving around the country in the run-up to Christmas.",,Foreign,Guardian,4

1559,All my dad does is cry': heartache over Covid visits ban in English care homes,11/3/20,"“The care home offers a Zoom call once a week for 20 minutes, but all my dad does is cry,” said Penny Ogden, 58, who hasn’t been able to hold her 89-year old father, John Ross, for coming up to eight months. “He says: ‘I’m finished here, I want to die.’ Since 12 March, I’ve had two garden visits, one raining the whole time, and two window visits, which were horrendous. All my dad was doing was crying and asking me to come in.” Ogden has a large family close to her father’s dementia care home in Liverpool, so her father used to receive two or three visits every day. Since the visits stopped, Ogden said her father has lost weight. He doesn’t understand why his family cannot visit, and he is beginning to forget who some of them are. She pays for him to have Netflix, but he seems to be sitting with the TV off whenever she calls.
Ogden is one of thousands of people who have been unable to visit their loved ones during the Covid pandemic, with care homes on high alert for outbreaks of the virus. For those who have dementia, the restrictions can be impossible to understand. “My dad just says, ‘what have I done wrong? I’ve lost all my family’,” Ogden said. “He says that nobody cares anymore.”
Ogden has pleaded with care staff to allow her to visit her father, offering to pay for tests for herself every week and volunteer at the care home for free, but they have told her they are simply following regulations. ‘We haven’t been apart until now’ Peter Williamson, 87, and his wife, Valerie, 85, have been married for 61 years and live in Greater Manchester. Two years ago, Valerie was diagnosed with dementia. When her health deteriorated this spring, she was taken into hospital, and shortly after, moved into a care home. Williamson hasn’t seen his wife face-to-face since her admission to hospital on 13 May. “We haven’t been apart until now,” he said. “I tried very hard to look after her, I didn’t want her to go into a care home.” The care home used to allow him to speak to Valerie through a partially open window, but when Greater Manchester was put into lockdown at the start of August, that stopped.
“I FaceTime her, which is better than nothing,” he said. “She still recognises me, but I can see visibly that she’s deteriorating. When she went into the home, she could walk, but now she has to use a wheelchair.” “I sometimes get a bit down and wonder if I’ll ever see her again.”
Williamson’s doctors think the stress of Valerie’s move caused him to suffer a stroke, which happened during a FaceTime call to his wife, though he has since recovered. He said he thought the government’s pilot scheme for relatives to be tested and given PPE to pay visits was a “good idea”, but he hadn’t heard anything since the announcement. “If it enables me to go to the care home, if I could sit for an hour with her, that would suit me fine,” he said. “I’ve read about it, but nothing’s happened.”
Despite being unable to go inside, Williamson calls the care home every day to ask how is wife is, and delivers flowers each weekend to make sure Valerie doesn’t forget him. “Sometimes she thinks she’s in a prison, and other times on a holiday in a hotel, and she asks why I can’t come to stay, and why I have to go away, and that hurts a bit really,” he said. “I give her the flowers to have something to remember me by. I don’t like her to forget me.” ‘He needs to know he is loved and cherished’ Before lockdown, Carole Quirke, 76, visited her husband, Barry, who turns 79 on Thursday, at his care home in Wiltshire about four times a week. The couple have been together for 27 years, and Barry was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia in 2014. At the start of lockdown, during window visits, Quirke would play his favourite music from the 1960s, and Barry would tap his feet and try to dance. Now, he does not react to the music, and has lost the ability to speak. “His life is about quality not quantity of time now,” said Quirke. “He is very ill, I know he is dying. He needs to know he is loved and cherished before he leaves.”
Quirke described the government’s pilot scheme announcement as “a PR stunt”.
“It doesn’t need to be a pilot, you just do it, that’s all we’re asking,” she said. “It’s very easy to put that in place, just start the testing. That’s all I’d love to do, is to go and help him and make him feel I’m there.” Last week, Barry and another resident tested positive, and on a second test, negative, for coronavirus. Quirke has been told that due to regulations, the care home must shut for a month, even to window visits. She is also worried about the impact a second lockdown will have, and said the situation has “floored” her. “When he was still lucid, I promised him I wouldn’t leave him alone with this disease,” she said. “I can feel he’s there and he needs comfort. I’ve said to the care home that if there’s any way around this, I’ll do it. I would just like a month of warmth for Barry before he goes.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4

1561,Finding them is not rocket science': the hunt for the Rwandan genocide fugitives,11/3/20,"No one paid much attention to the stooped old man who lived in the third-floor apartment of the comfortable but unexceptional block in Asnières-sur-Seine, a suburb on the outskirts of Paris. He shuffled off for his daily walks, and muttered inaudibly to those who greeted him. Then one morning in late May, 84-year-old Félicien Kabuga’s neighbours woke up to the startling news that they had been living next to an alleged mass killer. The arrest of Kabuga after a hunt lasting more than the quarter of a century made headlines around the world. Now Kabuga faces charges of playing a key role in the murders of about 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus during the Rwandan genocide in 1994 and is set to face a trial by a special UN tribunal next year. If convicted, he will spend the rest of his life in prison. The arrest has given new energy to the hunt for others on the run and accused of playing significant roles in the genocide. “People think that fugitives are living on an island in luxury but Kabuga was in a [one-bedroomed] apartment for years. Finding them is not rocket science … Justice is slow but will prevail, if there is political will and enough investigative resources,” said Serge Brammertz, the prosecutor who led the hunt. There is now hope that the arrest of Kabuga will not just shock those still fleeing justice, but anyone who is protecting them, particularly officials and policymakers. “We are trying to use the momentum [generated by the Kabuga arrest] to increase cooperation [which] remains very difficult. Replies to request for assistance are very slow,” Brammertz said.
An uneducated small trader who became the richest man in Rwanda and close to the elite clique which ran the genocide, Kabuga is accused of raising funds to buy the machetes used by militias to kill hundreds of thousands. He also co-owned an infamous radio station which broadcast messages charged with ethnic hatred, at one point telling armed gangs to “get to work” because mass graves were only “half full”. Kabuga fled Rwanda in the aftermath of the genocide but was forced out of Switzerland after he was identified as he attempted to apply for asylum. He then spent time in what was then Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and eventually in Kenya, where he supported powerful politicians and repeatedly evaded arrest. By 2007 he was back in Europe, and was narrowly missed by investigators when seeking medical treatment in Germany. More recently, Kabuga lived in a series of modest homes around Paris, remaining unidentified despite a $5m (£3.9m) reward offered by the US state department, which named him among the most wanted fugitives in the world. But investigators were closing in. Working with police across Europe, Brammertz used new technology to monitor the movements, finances and communications of the relatives who provided Kabuga’s essential support network. “We had been tracking the movements of all the phones and 15 family members. We could determine that of all of them, one was locked on to one cell tower in Paris. I concluded that this was the hiding place of Kabuga,” Brammertz, who was appointed prosecutor of the UN tribunal in 2016 after successfully tracking Serbian war criminals Ratko Mladić and Radovan Karadžić, said.
The Covid-19 lockdown ordered by French authorities meant gendarmes from a newly created unit focused on crimes against humanity could devote more resources to the Kabuga case, and also meant there was little chance of the wanted man moving before a raid could be organised. Though the empty streets made surveillance in the final stages of the investigation harder, the raid was successful. Policemen and prosecutors smashed in the apartment’s door, identified Kabuga with a DNA test, allowed him to make an omelette for breakfast and then took him into custody. Kabuga’s detention was welcomed by victims of the genocide, such as Valerie Mukabayire, leader of AVEGA Agahozo, a group of female survivors. “We were worried that [Kabuga’s] age would impede justice but now we are happy,” Mukabayire, who lost family members including her husband, said.
With the arrest of Kabuga and DNA confirmation of the death of the former defence minister Augustin Bizimana, prosecutors have now accounted for two of the three major fugitives indicted by the tribunal. Taking Kabuga’s place at the top of the wanted list is Protais Mpiranya, who was a commander in Rwanda’s presidential guard in 1994. Brammertz last year informed the UN security council that his office had developed “credible evidence” of the whereabouts of key fugitives and said he deeply regretted South Africa’s longstanding failure to execute an arrest warrant on one important individual, reported by local media to be Mpiranya. “My office is generating valuable intelligence and leads: telephone numbers, places of residence, identification documents, travel details and more. We have submitted numerous urgent requests for assistance – particularly to countries in east and southern Africa – to follow up on these leads … [which] remain unanswered for more than a year,” the prosecutor told the UN. Brammertz told the Guardian that the issue with South Africa was still pending. “I am always careful in publicly blaming and shaming but … [all countries] have an obligation under the UN charter to assist [the tribunal],” he said. One problem faced by investigators is that fugitives often use genuine travel documents issued in false names. Investigators are now trying to establish the motives of those who provided the more than 20 different passports used by Kabuga during his years on the run. These may have been obtained through bribery, or given to Kabuga on the orders of powerful individuals who wanted the accused man to stay hidden and silent. “Some of the people we are looking for are coming from a military background. Some have been involved in exploitation of natural resources. Some have been fighting together [with potential protectors] in the region,” Brammertz said. In September the French supreme court refused Kabuga’s appeal against extradition, which means he will be transferred to the custody of the UN tribunal, which is based in The Hague, Netherlands and Arusha, Tanzania. Last month judges decided he would be sent to a detention unit in The Hague out of health considerations amid the coronavirus pandemic, and be brought before an international judge there for an initial appearance in his war crimes case. At a hearing 11 days after his arrest, Kabuga denied the charges against him. “I have done nothing wrong,” he said. “These are lies. I never killed a Tutsi.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4

1563,Alok Sharma faces Covid safety questions as staff member tests positive,11/3/20,"The business secretary, Alok Sharma, is facing questions after a union health and safety inspection identified concerns over social distancing in his private office days before a member of his inner circle tested positive for Covid-19. The Guardian has learned that an employee in Sharmaâ€™s private office tested positive last Monday after reporting Covid symptoms a day earlier, with other members of staff in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) forced to isolate. But Sharma â€“ who had a meeting with the individual the Thursday before, with the pair also in the departmentâ€™s Whitehall office the following day â€“ went on a trip to South Korea on Saturday, where he continued meeting foreign dignitaries after being informed of his colleagueâ€™s positive test result when it came through on Monday.
A spokesman for the business secretary said his last â€œformal meetingâ€� where the individual was present was on Thursday, denying he had any â€œclose contactâ€� with them prior to his departure, including when they were both in the office on Friday, and said he had not been told to isolate by NHS test and trace. However, an undisclosed number of staff have been instructed to isolate, the department confirmed, and an area of the office has been deep cleaned.
Unions representing civil servants have written to the BEIS permanent secretary, Sarah Munby, to express â€œextreme concernâ€� following confirmed cases. There are understood to have been two other recent Covid cases among BEIS staff. The letter, from Public and Commercial Services (PCS) Union, FDA and Prospect, warns: â€œHealth and safety rules apply to everyone irrespective of grade or role. The recent confirmed case of the virus in the private office has now recklessly put a number of people at risk who could otherwise have been working from home. This is unacceptable.â€� It references a health and safety inspection carried out on Thursday 22 October â€“ the same day of Sharmaâ€™s meeting including the individual who has tested positive for Covid â€“ which found concerns. A copy of the PCS health and safety report seen by the Guardian, which said there were 28 staff working on the floor with ministerial offices â€“ including eight in Sharmaâ€™s office â€“ compared with only 12 on some others, stated: â€œMinisterial offices, especially SoS [secretary of state], were very crowded and by far the busiest part of the building. The offices apparently had been given a â€˜dispensationâ€™ â€¦ to allow two people to sit on each bank of desks, contrary to the guidance applying in the rest of the building. â€œWhilst they may well have been sitting 2 metres apart, because of movement in the office and narrow corridors, staff were often passing each other very closely and we observed staff standing closer together than 2 metres. We believe there are too many people (8 PO staff when we inspected) routinely in the SoSâ€™s private office to enable social distancing and so protect the health and safety of all staff.â€�
A PCS spokesman said: â€œThese revelations are extremely shocking and Alok Sharma has some serious questions to answer. Our members will be extremely worried at potentially being exposed to Covid-19 and will rightly want to know if proper safety processes were followed.â€�
On Tuesday, Sharma, who is president of the COP26 UN climate change conference being hosted by the UK in Glasgow next year, met two South Korean ministers, as well as the acting mayor of Seoul and South Korean National Assembly members working on the Green New Deal. If an individual is informed by NHS test and trace that they are a â€œcontactâ€� of someone who has caught Covid-19, by law they must isolate for 14 days from their last point of contact with the person. Government guidance defines a â€œcontactâ€� as â€œa person who has been close to someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 any time from two days before the person was symptomatic up to 10 days from onset of symptoms (this is when they are infectious to others)â€�. Among examples, it counts â€œhaving a face-to-face conversation within one metreâ€� with someone who has tested positive. It also lists â€œa person who has been within 2 metres of someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 for more than 15 minutesâ€�. A spokesperson for the business secretary said: â€œMr Sharma has followed government guidelines at all times. He had no close contact with the individual prior to his departure and has not been told to self-isolate by NHS test and trace. As required when travelling to South Korea, the business secretary was tested in the UK prior to departure and again on arrival in South Korea. Both tests returned negative results. Mr Sharma followed the local guidelines at all times during his visit.â€� A Beis spokesperson added: â€œWe have put in place extensive measures throughout the building to ensure that the two-metre social distancing rule is being observed, and to maintain a covid-secure work environment. â€œIn line with government guidance, the vast majority of our staff continue to work from home, and have done since the beginning of the pandemic. But the extensive measures we have taken ensure that a small number of colleagues who cannot carry out their normal duties from home are able to use the office, as well as those whose home or personal circumstances mean that they need to be able to access the building at least some of the time on a voluntary basis.â€�",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1564,Armed gang uses sewerage system to rob Milan bank,11/3/20,"A gang of armed robbers has broken into a bank in Milan by crawling through a sewerage network, stealing several safe-deposit boxes and escaping the same way. The carefully planned heist began shortly after 8.30am on Tuesday, when two of the robbers walked into the main entrance of a Crédit Agricole branch on Piazza Ascoli and and pointed guns at the staff, Italian media reported. Two accomplices then emerged from a manhole inside the bank that connects to an underground tunnel. The gang scuffled with the bank manager, who yelled “It’s a robbery”, and held him and another staff member hostage as dozens of police officers surrounded the bank. A third employee managed to escape. Police sealed off the area before entering the bank, but the robbers activated a fire extinguisher, creating confusion and giving them time to escape back down the manhole. Several officers reportedly followed them into the sewers but lost them. The robbers took 20 safe-deposit boxes, but it is not yet clear what they contained. The bank manager was reportedly hit on the head with the butt of a gun, but no other staff were harmed. Speaking to reporters outside the bank after the ordeal, the manager said: “They entered from the basement. There were three of us inside when I realised what was happening and shouted. There was a short scuffle but they did not beat me.” Milan prosecutors have opened an investigation.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1565,Austria terror attacker ‘pretended he had given up jihadism’,11/3/20,"An Islamic State-supporting gunman who killed four people and injured 23 others in an attack in central Vienna on Monday night deliberately “deceived” his mentors in a deradicalisation programme to feign a renunciation of jihadism, Austria’s interior minister has said. The 20-year-old dual Austrian and North Macedonian citizen, named as Kujtim Fejzulai, was shot dead by police nine minutes after opening fire in the Austrian capital’s first district at 8pm. His victims were “an elderly man, an elderly woman, a young male passerby and a waitress”, according to Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, who praised the bravery of a police officer shot in the attack and who is in a critical but stable condition. Twenty-three people were injured with gunshot and knife wounds, of whom seven were in a critical condition, Vienna’s hospital association said late on Tuesday night. Austria’s president, Alexander van der Bellen, said the nation’s tears were flowing for the victims and their relatives. He said the attack had targeted “life in a liberal democracy, which terrorists clearly hate deeply”.
On Tuesday, the city centre remained closed off, with 1,000 police officers patrolling the streets. The attacker had been armed with an automatic rifle, a handgun and a machete, and had been wearing a fake suicide vest. He had posted a photograph of himself with the weapons on his Instagram account before the attack, according to the interior minister, Karl Nehammer. Late on Tuesday Isis claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement by its Amaq News Agency posted on Telegram. Fourteen people associated with the assailant have been detained for questioning in searches on 18 properties in and near Vienna. After conflicting reports overnight, Nehammer said on Tuesday afternoon that there was no evidence so far of a second assailant. Police in Switzerland arrested two men aged 18 and 34 over possible links to the attacker in the city of Winterthur about 10km from Zurich. Swiss justice minister, Karin Keller-Sutter said the men were “obviously friends” with Fejzulai and said the three had met in person but did not say when. “The two men were arrested on Tuesday afternoon in coordination with the Austrian authorities,” Zurich cantonal police said. “The extent to which there was a connection between the two arrested persons and the alleged assassin is currently the subject of ongoing clarifications and investigations which are being carried out by the responsible authorities.” The attacker, born in Mödling, south of Vienna, developed a strong interest in political Islam as a teenager and eventually hatched plans to join Isis in Syria. He was deported from Turkey to Austria after a failed attempt in September 2018 to cross the border into Syria and was sentenced to 22 months in prison on 25 April 2019. The sentence – reduced in keeping with an Austrian law covering the rights of 18- to 20-year-olds – was suspended on 5 December under the condition he would be regularly monitored by probation services and a deradicalisation programme that works with the Austrian justice ministry. Nehammer said at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon that the terrorist had managed to deceive his mentors in such a way that no early warning signs pointing to his radicalisation had been registered. “We are seeing a fault line in our system,” said Nehammer, of the conservative Austrian People’s party (ÖVP). “There was a premature release of a radicalised person.” The young man had deliberately created the impression that he was eager to reintegrate into Austrian society in his meetings with the deradicalisation programme, Nehammer said, “all while being focused on destroying the system”. An attempt to revoke Fejzulai’s Austrian citizenship had also stalled because of lack of evidence proving terrorist activity, the interior minister said. “Fact is: the terrorist managed to deceive the judiciary’s deradicalisation programme … We need to evaluate and optimise the system on the side of the judiciary.” The Derad deradicalisation programme is a Vienna-based association staffed by 13 mentors who work with individuals who are either suspected of having become radicalised or have already been sentenced for an association with terror groups. One of the appeals of deradicalisation programmes is that they allow authorities to monitor individuals who are considered a potential risk to society for a longer period than if they were to simply sit out a prison sentence. Derad’s director, Moussa Al-Hassan Diaw, said he rejected Austrian media reports that his programme had declared Kujtim F not to be threat and thus vouched for his release. He said his organisation merely provided reports based on bi-monthly meetings with suspect individuals that a court could draw on. “Until a deradicalisation programme is stopped completely, there is always an element of risk,” said Al-Hassan Diaw. The Austrian justice minister Alma Zadić, of the Green party, defended the judiciary’s monitoring programme, saying that the country’s Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism had been informed of Fejzulai’s release. Kurz said the entire country had been the target of the attack. The chancellor called the murders “cold-blooded” and pledged that everything would be done to pursue those behind them. “The enemy, the Islamist terror, wants to split our society, but we will give no space to this hatred,” he said. “Our enemies are not the members of a religious community, these are terrorists. This is not a fight between Christians and Muslims, or Austrians and migrants, but a fight between civilisation and barbarity.” While Austria has not seen many high-profile jihadist terrorist attacks in recent years, the Alpine country has been a hub for extremist Islamist activity since the early 1990s, when Saudi Arabian and other Gulf organisations used it as a base for their operations supporting mujahideen fighters in Bosnia. The role was consolidated during subsequent conflicts in the Balkans, and revived in the early days of the Syrian civil war. Hundreds of young Austrians travelled to Syria to fight between 2012 and 2014, their journeys and recruitment facilitated by a series of networks based in “Salafi enclaves” in Vienna, Graz and other cities that were eventually broken up by Austrian security services. The country eventually sent more fighters to Syria per capita of population than any other in Europe, except Belgium. Austrian authorities launched a major crackdown, with key figures in the recruitment networks receiving lengthy prison sentences. However, problems with radicalisation have continued and there have been several attempted attacks, though some for unclear motives, over recent years. Many Austrian networks are closely linked to others in Germany, Switzerland and other neighbouring countries. “Jihadi terrorism is not new to Austria but [in recent years] we have only seen low-profile attacks by people using any available weapon … and not able to acquire explosives or AK-47s. What was surprising was not that there was an attack was not surprising, but the way it was carried out,” said Johannes Saal, an expert in Austrian extremism at the University of Lucerne, Switzerland.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1566,"Birx warns US entering ‘deadly phase’ of Covid, contradicting Trump’s message",11/3/20,"White House scientific adviser Dr Deborah Birx warned the United States is entering a new “deadly phase” of the coronavirus pandemic, and urged an “aggressive” approach to containing its spread. Birx gave the warning in a written memo delivered to top administration officials Monday. It is a direct contradiction of one of Donald Trump’s central, and false, closing campaign messages – that the US is “rounding the corner” on the pandemic. “We are entering the most concerning and most deadly phase of this pandemic,” Birx wrote in the memo, first reported by the Washington Post. She continued: “Cases are rapidly rising in nearly 30% of all USA counties, the highest number of county hotspots we have seen with this pandemic. Half of the United States is in the red or orange zone for cases despite flat or declining testing.” The memo came as Trump gathered hundreds at in-person rallies in key swing states, and warned that his political rival Joe Biden would lock down the country again. “This is not about lockdowns – it hasn’t been about lockdowns since March or April,” Birx said. “It’s about an aggressive, balanced approach that is not being implemented.”
Americans need “consistent messaging about uniform use of masks, physical distancing and hand washing, with profound limitation on indoor gatherings especially with family and friends,” she wrote. News of the memo comes after Dr Anthony Fauci, considered the top infectious disease expert in the US, who is the leading public health official on the White House coronavirus taskforce, while Birx is the team’s co-ordinator, warned the winter will bring “a whole lot of hurt”, if the US does not immediately change the pandemic’s trajectory. The US set a world record for new cases over the weekend, with more than 100,000 new diagnoses in one day. Hospitalizations have increased alongside new infections. Deaths, considered a lagging indicator, also rose slightly. Deaths have not reached the heights seen last spring, when the virus overwhelmed hospital systems in the north-east and New York City in particular. But experts warned they could rise to those levels again, if hospital systems become overwhelmed and are unable to find the nursing staff needed to treat patients. Already, hospital systems are struggling to find nurses, training those with limited experience in working in field hospitals, and relying on traveling nurses to provide care. Experienced nurses are “burned out with this whole (pandemic)” and some are quitting, said Kevin Fitzpatrick, an emergency room nurse at Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Michigan. “Replacing them is not easy,” he added. Meanwhile, the nursing home industry where America’s most medically vulnerable residents live, has warned cases are growing inside facilities and community spread will inevitably find its way inside facilities. Experts in personal protective equipment are also warning of shortages, including critically of nitrile gloves. Dr Shikha Gupta, executive director of the nonprofit Get Us PPE, warned: “We are deeply unprepared for what that’s going to bring as hospitals reach capacity across the US with surging caseloads.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1567,Boris's stooges back on the Covid tour throwing data at the politics,11/3/20,"Back in March, Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance were introduced – two ingenues blinking under the lights – to the nation at the Downing Street press conferences as the scientists to see the UK through the coronavirus pandemic. And even though Boris Johnson liked to treat the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser respectively as his two pet stooges, they were still the men on whose advice government policy was by and large made. But somewhere along the line, things soured. Whitty and Vallance became visibly uncomfortable when Boris chose to go rogue by interpreting the data to suit himself, and the relationship appeared to have completely broken down when the government ignored the advice of Sage to introduce a short “circuit breaker” lockdown and opted instead for a series of tiered regional lockdowns. Still, the band had reconciled its differences sufficiently to reform for a comeback tour for the briefing on Saturday at which the pair were invited to talk through some slides, before Johnson made the announcement – already leaked to the press the day before – that there was going to have to be another national lockdown after all. On Monday, it was Johnson’s turn to get it in the neck from MPs for the policy U-turn; on Tuesday it was that of Whitty and Vallance, who got to have their advice examined at a hastily assembled meeting of the science and technology select committee. It’s fair to say that both men would rather have been elsewhere. Any enjoyment at once again becoming public figures has quickly worn off, and Whitty and Vallance now yearn again for anonymity. The disconnect between MPs hungry for concrete data – and cheap political point-scoring – and experts who can only deal in probabilities has become too great. It was a clash of cultures in which there could be no winners. The session got off to a friendly enough start with the committee chair, Greg Clark, asking the questions. Nothing worse than having an academic paper that would probably be read by fewer than 10 people being peer-reviewed by one of your arch rivals. Vallance was adamant that he was only really confident in talking about six-week projections and pointed out that a lot of their predictions had proved to be totally accurate. Not so long ago Sage had been derided for suggesting deaths could rise to 200 a day by mid-November; that number had already long since been reached. Likewise, back in September, when there had been just 536 patients in hospital with Covid-19, people had laughed at the idea of that figure rising to 2,500 by mid-October. Now we were up to 10,000 and counting. So far, so good. Things got rather nastier when Labour’s Graham Stringer inquired why Vallance and Whitty had included a “reasonable worst case scenario” of 4,000 deaths a day in its slides at the Downing Street press conference when all other models were coming in significantly lower. Weren’t Sage guilty of trying to frighten Boris and the public into an unnecessary lockdown? “It wasn’t our intention to scare people,” Vallance insisted. One person’s reasonable worst case scenario was another’s walk in the park. That was the nature of the oxymoron. Besides, 4,000 wasn’t a prediction, it was a model, he said, without ever fully clarifying the difference between the two. And it was a model that had come from a reputable institution so it deserved to be included even if it was something of an outlier. At which point Whitty started to look visibly narked. So 4,000 might turn out to be well over the top, he snapped, but would MPs be happy to return to the daily death toll of 1,000 we had earlier in the year, because we were definitely on course to hit that target? And if MPs were happy with 1,000 deaths, then he wasn’t. Yes, the regional lockdowns had made a difference but the rate of infection was still going in the wrong direction and we didn’t want to reach a point where the NHS was unable to cope, because then there would also be a rise in excess deaths among cardiac and cancer patients. Things calmed down a bit after that but there was still a definite niggle in the room. Whitty observed that MPs kept asking for more and more data and Sage was doing its best to supply it. It wasn’t his fault if they didn’t like what they got. After all, it was inevitable that many of the predictions weren’t going to be entirely accurate. And instead of asking him for the economic costs of lockdown, why didn’t they try asking some economists instead? The whole essence of the coronavirus was there were no good choices. Scientists were having to choose between the crap and the really crap. Still, there was time for everyone to find some common ground. And that was on the uselessness of the government’s test-and-trace system. One of the goals of the lockdown was for the number of people infected to fall so far that Typhoid Dido might be able to locate at least a couple of their contacts. Serendipitously, Harding herself had simultaneously been given the graveyard slot of 5pm at the CBI conference. A time when it was almost guaranteed that everyone would have packed up for the day and she would struggle to trace herself. Clark desperately tried to end the session on something of an upbeat note. Would we be able to return to regional lockdowns in a month’s time, he asked desperately. Whitty and Vallance both shrugged. They hadn’t a clue. There were just too many variables in getting the R down below 1. But things were looking a bit more rosey, Clark said. There was the possibility of a vaccine, for a start. The winter might be hard, but the spring would be bright. “Brighter,” Whitty corrected him, keen to nip any signs of optimism in the bud. The afternoon hadn’t been his idea of fun, but at least he got to have the last word.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1568,Canada makes plan to evacuate its citizens from Hong Kong,11/3/20,"Canada has drawn up plans to evacuate hundreds of thousands of its citizens from Hong Kong if necessary, but officials have cautioned they can do little for pro-democracy activists seeking refuge from the Chinese authorities. Jeff Nankivell, Canada’s consul general in Hong Kong and Macao, told a parliamentary committee the federal government had drafted plans to assist nearly 300,000 Canadians living in in the territory if the security situation deteriorated. “We do have detailed plans in place and we have resources available and identified to cover a range of situations up to, and including, a situation where the urgent departure of a large number of Canadians would be necessary,” he said. “The likelihood of that kind of extreme scenario appears right now to be low, but it’s our job to plan for the most extreme situations.” The potential need for evacuation plans was underlined by China’s decision in the summer to enact a controversial security measure. The law, which critics say has criminalised activism and dissent in Hong Kong, has stifled pro-democracy movements and had a chilling effect on media, education and politics. Nankivell’s testimony is likely to further escalate tensions between China and Canada. After Ottawa expressed support for activists in Hong Kong, China’s ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, said any “interference in China’s domestic affairs” could potentially jeopardise the “ the good health and safety” of Canadian citizens living in in the territory.
Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, quickly condemned the ambassador’s remarks, and accused China of “coercive diplomacy.” Canada has plans for a large-scale evacuation, but Nankivell said his staff were unable to help asylum seekers looking for protection at the consulate. “The global policy of Canada, similar to most other countries, is that our diplomatic missions, including consulates, do not accept applications of asylum at our offices from people who are in their own territory,” he said, adding that no one had yet tried to claim asylum. In contrast to Canada’s evacuation plans, the UK has said it would extend immigration rights to Hong Kong residents who hold a British National Overseas (BNO) passport. There are currently 300,000 BNO passport holders – those who were born before the 1997 handover of the British territory – but as many as 3 million people could qualify. China has criticised the plan. Its foreign ministry recently told the UK to “immediately correct its mistakes” and rescind the offer, according to Reuters. The new visas would permit five-year entry, as opposed to the current six months, and applications open on 31 January.

1569,China changes school curriculum to reflect Beijing's positive Covid narrative,11/3/20,"Chinese government-endorsed content about the pandemic and the “fighting spirit” of the country’s response will be added to school curriculum, the country’s ministry of education has said, in a move to enshrine the country’s narrative of success against the virus. The content will be added to elementary and middle school classes in biology, health and physical education, history, and literature, and will “help students understand the basic fact that the Party and the state always put the life and safety of its people first”, the ministry said on Wednesday. “Students will learn about key figures and deeds which emerged during the epidemic prevention and control efforts. They will learn to foster public awareness and dedication, to enrich knowledge about the advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics,” the ministry said.
Earlier this year the National People’s Congress aired a proposal for the successes to be enshrined in the school curriculum, and content about China’s “fighting spirit” had already been incorporated into some high school subjects, Sixthtone reported. While there was domestic pushback on China’s virus response, in particular the early attempts to cover up the outbreak and silence health workers who tried to speak out, the government has presented its efforts as hugely successful in containing Covid-19. In June it release a report lauding its own success and denying there was any coverup. The country has largely contained the virus, and sporadic outbreaks – most recently in the Xinjiang region – are quickly clamped down on with local lockdowns and mass testing. But there are concerns about the approaching winter, and China’s National Development and Reform Commission has called on local governments to “guide families” in storing medical supplies ahead of a heightened risk of a Covid resurgence and the flu. In Guangdong province, the health commission has released a list of 33 items for families to stock up on, from face masks and anti-bacterial swabs to first-aid material and emergency supplies like biscuits, water, escape rope ladders and whistles and and flashlights. Beijing, Jinan, Ningbo and other cities have issued similar recommendations to households. Hospitals and clinics are also stockpiling emergency supplies, including preparing stadiums, exhibition halls and other public venues for the possibility of being turned into temporary quarantine wards. Authorities in Zhejiang province have said that by the end of this year, every district or city should have no less than two large venues that can be quickly converted into emergency medical spaces. The emergency supplies lists have prompted speculation from internet users over whether US warships were approaching China’s southern coast, while residents outside of the country asked whether Chinese officials might be preparing for war. China’s state-run Global Times dismissed the rumours. “It is crucial to have necessary family supplies in wartime, but a war is not going to happen within the next few years,” Song Zhongping, a military commentator told the paper. China has reported a total of 86,070 cases since the beginning of the pandemic, with a death toll of 4,634. On Tuesday it reported 49 confirmed cases from the previous day, including 44 imported from overseas. It also reported 61 asymptomatic cases found through testing, which it does not include in its tally of confirmed Covid-19 cases.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1570,Chris Whitty decries Great Barrington plan to let Covid run wild,11/3/20,"A high-profile proposal to avoid lockdown by letting the coronavirus run wild in the young and healthy while shielding the most vulnerable is dangerously flawed and operationally impractical, according to England’s chief medical officer. Prof Chris Whitty told MPs on the science and technology committee that the Great Barrington declaration, put forward by three scientists at Oxford, Harvard and Stanford universities, would lead to a very large number of deaths and was unlikely to achieve such widespread immunity that the epidemic would fizzle out naturally. Speaking at the hearing with Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, Whitty said he expected the month-long lockdown for England that Boris Johnson announced at the weekend to have the desired effect of bringing the R value below 1 across the country, causing the number of cases to fall. The scientists, who were called before the committee to explain the evidence behind the latest lockdown, said that left unchecked, hospital admissions would exceed levels seen in April, a situation Whitty described as “entirely realistic”.
Questioned on England’s strategy for lifting the lockdown, Whitty said he expected changes to be made to the three-tier system imposed in October. Vallance said further measures would be needed until the spring to keep infections down.
“We’re likely to need degrees of social distancing and other measures over the course of the winter. It’s only really come springtime and beyond when other things may start to allow some more relaxation,” Vallance said. Vaccines, new drugs and improved testing would all be important for restrictions to be eased, he added. His comments came as Dido Harding, the under-pressure head of NHS test and trace, conceded the system needed to improve during the second lockdown if the country was to recover. Lady Harding has faced criticism for the performance of the six-month tracing system, which last month contacted less than 60% of infected people’s contacts. In an interview conducted at the CBI’s virtual annual conference on Tuesday, she said that the main problem was finding and testing people who had Covid but displayed no symptoms. “Every country is grappling with the same problem. Despite everyone’s best efforts and all of the work of our team in NHS test and trace to be the second line of defence, the virus is spreading too rapidly and too widely,” she said. “As we go into another really challenging period for us as a country, it is time for the organisation that I lead to take the next big leap forward. We will be focusing on improving NHS test and trace so that when England emerges from lockdown we are better able to live with Covid.”
MPs on the science and technology committee earlier pressed Vallance to explain why he had shown out-of-date modelling from Cambridge University and Public Health England at the prime minister’s announcement of the new lockdown on Saturday. The modelling suggested that deaths could reach 4,000 a day in the coming weeks if nothing were done, a figure the Labour MP Graham Stringer said “frightened a lot of people around the country”. The modelling was based on the growth of the epidemic before the tier system was brought in and gave unrealistically high numbers of deaths. Vallance defended the decision and said it was one scenario that informed thinking about a reasonable worst-case scenario. More recent results from the Cambridge model point to a much lower daily death rate, bringing it in line with other models that suggest they could reach about 2,000 a day. The Great Barrington declaration calls on governments to protect the most vulnerable and let the rest of society return to life as normal. The aim is to let the virus spread in the young and healthy who build up enough immunity that the epidemic grinds to a halt.
Whitty, however, said that with the vast majority of infectious diseases, herd immunity was never achieved naturally, and that it was “simply impractical” to believe vulnerable people in the community, care homes, hospitals and elsewhere could be shielded. Another concern, he said, was that the strategy assumed that “very large numbers of people would inevitably die” unless all vulnerable people could be identified and isolated perfectly for several years. “Other than that, it no doubt has some merits,” he said. Vallance agreed with the assessment and said Sage, the government’s expert committee, had reviewed the Great Barrington proposal and found “fatal flaws in the argument”.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1571,Coronavirus surges across midwest as Trump attacks health professionals,11/3/20,"America set a world record for new daily cases over the weekend as Covid-19 cases spread across the midwest and hospitalizations increased. The increases come just as Americans anxiously ready themselves for an election season climax, in which the incumbent Donald Trump has attacked healthcare providers and adopted Covid-19 misinformation in his final arguments for re-election.
Over the weekend Trump hinted he might fire Anthony Fauci, the US’s foremost infectious diseases expert, if re-elected. “Don’t tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election. I appreciate the advice. I appreciate it,” said Trump after the Florida crowd chanted: “Fire Fauci.” Trump also falsely claimed: “Our doctors get more money if someone dies from Covid. You know that, right?” Dr Jim Souza, chief medical officer for St Luke’s, a hospital system with several locations in Idaho, responded: “If you’ve never seen a patient intubated on mechanical ventilation, connected to a dialysis machine, in a prone position, sedated and paralyzed – if you’ve never been part of that care – it’s heavy physical labor, it’s psychologically heavy work. “It is just not OK to be calling into question the professional ethics of the very people who are on the frontlines fighting this fire,” said Souza. Idaho has seen a 10% increase in cases in the last week. It is among a handful of the worst-hit states per capita in the nation, including neighboring Montana and Wyoming. North and South Dakota continue to lead the nation in new Covid-19 cases per capita. More than 231,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the US, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. While the outbreak is worse in the west, it is not confined to that region. Infection and hospitalization rates have trended upward across the United States in the last two-week period, according to Covid Exit Strategy. Uncontained spread makes one of the central tenets of lowering transmission – contact tracing – extremely difficult to impossible, as evidenced last month when North Dakota told residents to trace and notify their own contacts. But even as an autumn wave swells, Trump has spent the final days of his campaign insisting the US is “rounding the corner” on the Covid-19 pandemic; holding in-person rallies which may have spread the disease to as many as 30,000 people by one estimate. Trump’s attacks on his rival, the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, have also been focused on Covid-19, as he told a crowd in North Carolina that Biden would “lock down” the nation again and make the country a “prison state” to contain the virus. “More and more facilities are requesting [personal protective equipment],” said Dr Shikha Gupta, executive director of Get Us PPE, a non-profit which supplies healthcare facilities with PPE, when they cannot find equipment through suppliers. “We are deeply unprepared for what that’s going to bring as hospitals reach capacity across the US with surging caseloads.” Nursing homes, where less than 1% of Americans live but which account for 41% of Covid-19 deaths, also remain extremely vulnerable to outbreaks. “We lack personal protective equipment, we lack comprehensive surveillance and testing, and, to be honest, a number of nursing homes still struggle with infection control,” David C Grabowski, a health policy professor at Harvard Medical School, said. “We’ve seen this play out now twice.” Nancy Roberts, a respiratory therapist at St Luke’s, said she had seen Covid-19-positive patients come in, “and they’re on just a little bit of oxygen, and in 24 hours they could be intubated and on a ventilator, and they’re terrified. “For somebody to not believe this is happening, it blows my mind. I cannot personally wrap my head around that,” Roberts said. ‘One death is one too many deaths from this virus.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1572,Deciphering the quirks of England's second Covid lockdown rules,11/3/20,"The government has published the full regulations for England’s second national lockdown, which is to begin on Thursday and will last for four weeks. A number of details had already emerged, and some are sufficiently complex to have puzzled even ministers. You can exercise with one other person, but not while holding a racket Meetings with people outside of your household or support bubble are barred, with the exception of one-to-one gatherings in outdoor public spaces – a park or the countryside rather than a private garden. While gyms and other sports facilities will be closed, you can exercise outside with one other person but only if it is not formal sport. Thus, you can run (at a 2-metre distance) with someone else, and Downing Street said on Tuesday that one person can meet with a personal trainer in a park if they remain distanced. But despite some lobbying, tennis, golf and other non-contact outdoor sports will be banned for the duration of the lockdown. Michael Gove tweeted an apology on Tuesday after incorrectly saying he thought tennis would be allowed. Of course, this is all different when it comes to members of your own household – parents can still kick a football around with their children, for example. You can meet a friend with your three-year-old, but not with your six-year-old Unlike in Scotland, when England introduced the “rule of six” limit for gatherings, children of any age were included despite some evidence that younger children appear less likely to transmit coronavirus. When the new lockdown was announced, the English rule was set to continue, which would have meant, for example, that parents caring for a baby or toddler would be unable to meet anyone from outside their household. Following an outcry, ministers said they would amend the rule. So you will be able to meet someone else with a child or children in tow, but only if they are below school age. You can go fishing (and maybe swim), but only on public land Angling is permitted, but only in a public space – for example by a river, rather than within the grounds of an angling club. Lidos and bathing ponds will have to close, the source of much protest from the sector, but a Downing Street spokesman said he did not know whether, say, a single person going swimming in a river or lake would contravene the rules. Perhaps the full regulations will clear this up. You can go to a church or mosque, but not for a service As with the spring lockdown, places of worship are being told to close, with a few exceptions. As well being allowed to host funerals, they can stay open if they are being used for another purpose, such as a food bank, formal childcare, or as part of a school. Individual prayer is also allowed but not services, again something that has prompted some protest. Weddings are not allowed, apart from in “exceptional circumstances”. You can order alcohol ‘by post’ There is a section on the ways in which people can buy alcohol for off-site consumption, which they can do at any time other than between 10pm and 5am. Helpfully, the guidance says the order can be placed online, by phone or text message, or “by post”. Model villages have to close The regulations include a detailed list of “other businesses” which must close, taking in everything from massage parlours and hostess bars, to outdoor markets – apart from those selling livestock or food – “visitor attractions at film studios”, and perhaps most niche of all, model villages.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1573,Does Vienna attack signal new wave of jihadist terrorism?,11/3/20,"Does the attack in Vienna on Monday night presage a return to the darkest days of the wave of terrorist violence that shook Europe between 2012 and 2017? Over that five-year period, hundreds died in lethal stabbings, attacks with cleavers, bombings of stadiums and airports, as well as assaults by multiple gunmen in city centres with AK-47s that bear horrible resemblance both to that still being investigated in the Austrian capital and the spate of attacks in France in recent weeks. All were the bloody work of young European sympathisers of Islamic State, then at the zenith of its power. So too was this most recent tragedy, it appears. We now know something of the gunman shot dead in the attack in Vienna. He is described as 20 years old, born and raised in Austria, and recently released after serving part of a 22-month jail sentence for trying to travel to Syria to fight for Islamic State. Before the attack, he posted images on social media: a selfie with an AK-47 assault rifle and a machete, but also a bayat, or oath of allegiance to Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Quraishi, the current leader of Isis, and one of its best-known slogans spelled out in ammunition. Isis has claimed responsibility for the attack, but investigators are working to establish if the group directed or simply “inspired” it. Austria has been spared the worst of the violence in Europe, but not the phenomenon of radicalisation among a small number of young men in often marginalised Muslim communities. The country was second only to Belgium as a source of so-called “foreign fighters” in Iraq and Syria, measured per capita, and has a history of radical activism going back to the 1990s. That less attention has been paid in the west to Islamic extremism recently is understandable. Deaths in Europe from all forms of terrorism fell by 70% last year, and western Europe recorded its lowest number of incidents since 2012. According to the latest Europol reports, there were 21 jihadist plots in the EU in 2019, compared with 24 and 33 in the two previous years. Of the 21, four failed, 14 were foiled and three were carried out. Nor does the scale of the attacks come close to the horrors of 2015 and 2016, when assault rifles and a truck were used to kill hundreds of people in a series of attacks. That surge in violence came when ill-prepared western security services faced an organisation viewed as extreme even by other Islamists, determined to attack the west and ruling over a swath of territory that was easily accessible to Europeans. But, though none of these factors remain, the threat does, albeit at a much reduced level. “The fact that the number of [Isis]-inspired attacks has declined in the EU does not mean that the threat has disappeared. It primarily means that we have got better at detecting and breaking up terrorist plots,” said Gilles de Kerchove, the EU’s counter-terror co-ordinator, in an interview earlier this year. There is much evidence of continuing, if sporadic, attempts by Isis to get potential attackers or organisers into Europe. There have been a series of arrests in Spain and Poland of individuals and groups suspected of planning operations and recruitment. In some cases, these efforts have begun to show results. In April, German police arrested five Tajik nationals on suspicion that they were members of an Isis cell that had been planning attacks on US forces stationed in Germany, Isis has told supporters to exploit the disarray caused in western European countries by Covid. The group and allied networks have flooded social media with calls to violence since the murder near Paris last month of a school teacher who showed caricatures of the prophet Muhammad to students. Counter-terrorism officials say it is too early to tell the degree to which recent attacks are the work of senior Isis leaders, possibly in the Middle East or elsewhere. The young Tunisian who killed three worshippers in a church in Nice last week had arrived in Europe only a month before. There have been examples of very rapid radicalisation but few at such an accelerated pace. This raises the possibility that he had set out to carry out some kind of attack before reaching Europe, or that he had been instructed to do so. Likewise, few so-called “lone wolves” act alone. Research has shown that most “leak” information about their attentions to others before. There are reports that the Vienna attacker had communicated with two contacts earlier in the day, sending some kind of jihadist propaganda to each. In Germany in 2016, Isis organisers were sending encouraging messages and advice to an attacker on social media until seconds before he stabbed and hacked at passengers on a train. One very obvious question is how an attacker got hold of high-powered weaponry and large quantities of ammunition. Experts point to the Balkans as a probable source. Finally, there is the question of timing. Terrorists want their attacks to gain maximum publicity, not be submerged in other news, so the US elections are unlikely to be a factor. More likely, if more mundane, is a desire to strike before the Covid-19 lockdown in Austria, imposed from midnight, made it harder to both move and find vulnerable targets.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1574,"England lockdown will end on 2 December, Boris Johnson insists",11/3/20,"Boris Johnson has told the cabinet that England’s lockdown restrictions will come to an end on 2 December, saying that was a hard deadline to develop a new solution to contain the spread of the virus. In a tacit admission that the current NHS test and trace system had not been enough to contain the virus, Johnson heralded a mass testing operation beginning in Liverpool, the start of an ambitious programme “Operation Moonshot” which would involve the entire population tested on a regular basis. The prime minister also appeared to affirm the government expected the four-week national lockdown in England would be enough to get the virus’s reproduction R number below one – raising questions as to whether the lockdown would be extended should that not occur.
“Once again we are alas asking everybody to stay at home to protect the NHS to save lives and get the R down below one. I know we can, I know we will. It’s only just above one at the moment,” he said. Speaking to the cabinet meeting, Johnson acknowledged that there would be dissent in the party. MPs will vote on Wednesday on the latest measures, with a small rebellion expected of Tory MPs – though any extension of lockdown measures would be likely to cause a far larger rebellion. “Let’s be in no doubt none of us came into politics to introduce measures like this,” Johnson said. “We don’t want to be doing things to repress liberty, we don’t want to do anything to damage our economy, to stop business from going about their lives, to stop anybody from doing what they wanted to do. But … what we’re doing is vital to suppress the virus and to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed.”
Johnson reiterated that doctors and nurses would “be forced to make appalling choices on who to treat and who not to treat” if nothing further was done. However, he said there was a “clear way ahead” and said the deadline of 2 December was a hard finish – and that a new solution needed to be developed by then. “We have a very clear way ahead. These measures – the crucial thing to understand is that they expire on 2 December. They come to an end. And we therefore as a government and indeed as a country have a deadline and a target to develop solutions which previously … did not exist,” he said. Johnson said rapid-turnaround testing “can be a massive and possibly decisive use to us in this country in defeating the virus”. He said that “amid the uncertain gloom of November I see light ahead” and said ministers must “work flat out as a government to repay the confidence of the people who are doing the right thing and following the latest autumn measures”.
With two days to go before measures come into effect, ministers earlier prompted confusion over England’s new lockdown rules with Michael Gove apologising for incorrectly indicating tennis and golf could be played, as cabinet colleague Robert Jenrick apparently wrongly suggested a family would be allowed to meet a friend for a walk outside. Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, issued an apology for signalling that singles tennis and golf in pairs could still go ahead. Jenrick, the communities secretary, mistakenly said that a family could go for a walk with a friend – despite there being a two-person limit on people meeting outdoors when outside of households or support bubbles. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said: “This is a pretty stark admission that fixing contact tracing isn’t a priority for Boris Johnson. Ministers lost control of the virus in the first place because of their failure to build an effective localised contact tracing regime with proper support to help people isolate. “The priority for the next four weeks is rolling out saliva based testing more widely for key workers especially NHS staff, fixing contact tracing by putting local public health teams in charge and ensuring people have security to isolate when needed.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1575,Faith leaders challenge England lockdown ban on communal worship,11/3/20,"England’s most senior faith leaders have challenged the government’s decision to ban communal worship during the second lockdown, telling Boris Johnson there is no scientific basis for the move. In a marked change of tone from the lockdown earlier this year, the faith leaders say: “We strongly disagree with the decision to suspend public worship during this time.” Continuation of public worship is essential, the leaders of the Church of England, Catholic church and orthodox Judaism, along with Muslim, Hindu, Sikh and Pentecostal representatives, told the prime minister in a joint letter. Places of worship have demonstrated in recent months that they can be made safe from Covid transmission, they say. “Given the significant work we have already done, we consider there to be, now, no scientific justification for the wholesale suspension of public worship.” Highlighting the work done by churches, synagogues, mosques and temples to support communities through the pandemic, they add: “Our commitment to care for others comes directly from our faith, which must be sustained and strengthened by our meeting together in common worship.” Earlier, Christopher Chessun, the Anglican bishop of Southwark, urged clergy and members of congregations in his diocese to write to MPs “questioning these restrictions”. He said: “The church is not a branch of the leisure or hospitality industries with a tap that can be turned on and off by politicians at will. The right to freedom of religion is enshrined in Magna Carta and it is of the very essence of our common life that the liberties and freedoms of the people of this land extend to public worship.” A legal challenge over the ban on communal worship is expected to be launched by a conservative faith-based organisation, with the backing of more than 70 leaders from different Christian traditions. A pre-action letter organised by Christian Concern, which has been behind a string of legal cases citing freedom of religion in recent years, says: “Our clients fully acknowledge the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic and the need for drastic precautions … However, such precautions may only be lawfully introduced by the churches themselves … Our clients are gravely concerned about this infringement of the constitutional liberties of the church by the secular government.” The Muslim Council of Britain has called for an urgent review of restrictions, criticising the government’s “inadequate consultation and poor engagement with faith communities”. Sikhs have raised concerns about Bandi Chhor Divas and Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s Gurpurab, two holidays in November when most Sikhs attend their Gurdwara. “It appears the government ignored the needs of the Sikh community,” said Bhai Amrik Singh, the chair of the Sikh Federation (UK).
The interfaith letter to the prime minister was signed by Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury; Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York; Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London; Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster; Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi; Gurmail Singh Malhi, president Sri Guru Singh Sabha, Southall; Shaykh Dr Asim Yusuf, chair of the British Board of Scholars and Imams; Sayed Yousif Al-Khoei of Al-Khoei Foundation; Agu Irukwu, senior pastor, Jesus House for all Nations; Rajnish Kashyap, general secretary of the Hindu Council UK; and Daniel Singleton, national executive director of Faith Action.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1576,"Golden jackals expected to emerge in Belgium, say experts",11/3/20,"After more than a century, Belgium recently witnessed the return of the wolf and the lynx due to a mix of nature and nurture reasons. Now, to the trepidation of local farmers, an entirely alien species to the country is on the verge of making an entrance: the jackal. The expectation that the wolf-like canine will be seen for the first time follows the discovery of attacks on sheep in Kranenburg, a German municipality in North Rhine-Westphalia, just 40 miles from the Belgian border. In September, six ravaged sheep offered gruesome evidence of the creature. “Initially it was thought that they were killed by a wolf, but now further investigation shows that the culprit is a male golden jackal,” said Jan Loos, from the animal protection organisation Welcome Wolf. Near by, the golden jackal is already in evidence in the Netherlands.
As with wolves, the golden jackal is a protected species under the Berne Convention and the EU Habitats Directive. But it is believed the major opening for both animals lies in the growing movement of people out of the countryside and into cities, leaving space for them to make the abandoned land their own. Kranenburg is on the same route that wolves have been known to cross from Germany to the Netherlands and on to the Belgian province of Limburg. Frederic Thoelen, a biologist at the Natuurhulpcentrum Opglabbeek, told the Het Nieuwsblad newspaper he was “almost certain that this jackal will also settle in our regions”. “Depending on the circumstances, this could be tomorrow if necessary, but just as well within two years,” he said. “They mainly target small animals, but also chickens or sometimes even sheep. Unlike the wolf, they do not attack larger animals, such as sick or weakened cows.” Recent years have seen an explosion in the numbers of golden jackals in northern Europe, with some 117,000 in existence by the latest official estimate. Native to the Middle East and southern Asia, but also known to inhabit Thailand, Pakistan and India, the opportunistic omnivore arrived at the southern edge of central and eastern Europe about 8,000 years ago. Its population grew, coinciding with a reduction of grey wolf numbers in Europe in the 19th century. The two tend to avoid being in the same territory. Bulgaria now has the largest numbers, but there are also significant populations in Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Greece, Slovenia, Croatia, Austria and Italy. Evidence of the animal has also been found in France, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, Poland, Belarus and Estonia.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1577,Gunmen on loose in Vienna after 'repulsive terror attack',11/3/20,"Police in Vienna are hunting at least one gunman after a string of shootings described by the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, as a “repulsive terror attack” left at least three people dead. Two civilians were killed by gunmen, while one attacker was killed by police in the centre of the Austrian capital. At least one gunman remains on the run, but authorities have not ruled out there being more still at large. The initial shootings took place at six different locations in the city centre and authorities warned of a group of “heavily armed and dangerous” gunmen. Fifteen other people – including at least one police officer – were seriously injured in exchanges of gunfire. Seven victims were reported to be in critical condition.
“We have become victims of a repulsive terror attack in the capital that is ongoing,” Kurz said in a press conference. “We are currently experiencing difficult hours in our republic. I would like to thank all the emergency forces who are risking their lives for our safety, especially today. Our police will take decisive action against the perpetrators of this repulsive terrorist attack.” Kurz said the army would protect sites in the capital so the police could focus on anti-terror operations. Speaking to the Austrian broadcaster ORF, he said the attackers “were very well equipped with automatic weapons” and had “prepared professionally”. Vienna mayor Michael Ludwig announced two civilians had been killed by gunmen several hours after the attacks. The identities of those killed have not been made public. One attacker was shot dead by police. According to government sources, the slain terrorist was carrying an explosive belt and a bag filled with ammunition, ORF reported. The explosive belt was being defused by a de-mining team into the early hours of Tuesday. Frequent sirens and helicopters could be heard in the city centre and large numbers of police were guarding an area near the city’s world-famous opera house. “We have brought several special forces units together that are now searching for the presumed terrorists. I am therefore not limiting it to an area of Vienna because these are mobile perpetrators,” Nehammer told ORF, urging the public to stay indoors until the all-clear was given. “We believe there are several perpetrators. Unfortunately there are also several injured, probably also dead,” he said.
The attack began just hours before Austria was due to introduce new coronavirus restrictions, including an 8pm until 6am curfew that came into effect at midnight on Monday night. Bars and restaurants in the network of narrow streets known to locals as the “Bermuda triangle” were packed. Shooting first broke out at around 8pm on Seitenstettengasse street in the centre of the city but spread out to what police said were six different shooting locations in the vicinity. A witness said a gunman had started to fire at random at groups of people sitting at tables. Footage purportedly showing the attack and shared by European counter-terrorism officers showed a puddle of blood by the entrance of a restaurant. Another unconfirmed clip showed a man carrying a rifle and wearing a white shirt and beige trousers firing shots towards a building. A male voice can be heard shouting “Asshole, motherfucker” at the attacker from one of the buildings. Police repeatedly appealed for witnesses to refrain from sharing photographs or video from the scene after footage which appeared to show an injured policeman was briefly posted on Twitter. Initial reports had suggested that the nearby Stadttempel synagogue could have been the target of the attack. But Oskar Deutsch, president of the Jewish Community Vienna, said the synagogue on Seitenstettengasse and the office building at the same address were already closed at the time of the attack, and it was “unclear” if it was one of the targets of the attack. Deutsch told the Kurier newspaper that no members of Vienna’s Jewish community were among those injured in the attack. Citing an interview with a rabbi living directly above the synagogue, Kurier reported an attacker had taken random shots at people sitting outside cafes and bars on Judengasse and Seitenstettengasse in central Vienna. “He did not aim at the Stadttempel [synagogue],” the witness said. The synagogue was the target of a terror attack almost four decades ago. On 29 August 1981, two members of the Palestinian group Fatah – The Revolutionary Council, also known as ANO – tried to storm the synagogue building but were stopped by security forces. Two people were killed and 21 others injured in the attack. More recently, however, Austria had been spared the sort of major attacks that have hit other European countries. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, tweeted that “we French share the shock and sorrow of the Austrian people”.
“After France, it’s a friendly nation that has been attacked,” he added, referring to the killing on Thursday of three people by a knife-armed attacker in Nice and the beheading of a schoolteacher by a suspected Islamist outside Paris several days before. Boris Johnson tweeted: “I am deeply shocked by the terrible attacks in Vienna tonight. The UK’s thoughts are with the people of Austria – we stand united with you against terror.” Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte said there was “no room for hatred and violence in our common European home”, while his foreign minister Luigi Di Maio, tweeted that “Europe must react”. Czech police said they had started random checks on the border with Austria. “Police are carrying out random checks of vehicles and passengers on border crossings with Austria as a preventive measure in relation to the terror attack in Vienna,” Czech police tweeted.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1578,High court rejects legal challenge over Dominic Cummings breach,11/3/20,"The high court has rejected a legal bid to challenge a decision not to investigate Dominic Cummings’s journey from London to Durham at the height of the first coronavirus lockdown. Max Hill, the director of public prosecutions, said any decision to investigate Cummings must be made by the police. He did not have the power to interfere. Martin Redston, a 70-year-old director of a London engineering firm, had sought a judicial review over the case. At a hearing in London on Tuesday, Michael Mansfield QC said Cummings “appearing to evade any genuine scrutiny for his actions due to government associations is undermining of respect for the rule of law”. Mansfield argued that as Hill had oversight of the prosecution system, he had a duty to “nudge” the police with advice, particularly over new legislation such as the coronavirus rules. In the Cummings case, he said Hill should have “stepped in with some friendly advice” following Durham Constabulary’s three-day investigation, which only examined Cummings’s movements in County Durham including a 52-mile round trip to Barnard Castle. Mansfield said: “He should have said to the Metropolitan police: ‘This is worthy of investigation in relation to the circumstances in which Dominic Cummings left his home … and whether this does constitute a reasonable excuse.’” He also said it was important for Hill to assert his independence from government after the attorney general and prime minister said Cummings had done nothing wrong. Mansfield argued there was a clear public interest in an investigation over a concern that “the lawmaker broke the law he has made or helped to make”, adding: “If there is a prominent member of government we say flagrantly not obeying them [the rules], this affects the level of security and health for the rest. The public would be reassured if they knew they had been properly investigated.” Duncan Atkinson QC, for Hill, argued the director of public prosecutions did not have the power to refer cases to the police. In any case, Hill had not made a decision not to prosecute, the court was told. “There is no decision that can be judicially reviewed,” he said. Permission to review was rejected. Lady Justice Carr, sitting with Mr Justice Picken, said: “The decision in principle is that this renewed claim for permission to apply for judicial review will be refused.” The reasoning for the decision will be set out later this week. Redston said he would consider an appeal. Speaking outside the court he added: “I’m very disappointed. The ultimate aim of this is to ensure that Dominic Cummings is actually prosecuted for the breach of lockdown regulations. So now we need to consider how we go forward.”",,Politics,Guardian,4
1579,Hong Kong TV journalist charged over report on police misconduct,11/3/20,"Hong Kong police have arrested and charged a journalist at a public broadcaster in relation to a documentary about the 2019 Yuen Long incident, when police were accused of standing by as armed thugs attacked commuters. RTHK confirmed the arrest of Choy Yuk-ling, one of the producers of Hong Kong Connection. The respected current affairs programme investigated the police response to the attack, which left 45 people needing treatment in hospital. Police charged Choi with two counts of giving false information, by misusing a vehicle number plate search as part of the investigation. The case will go before a magistrates court on 10 November, where she faces fines of up to HK$5,000 and six months in jail. Video footage of the attack, on 21 July 2019, showed dozens of mostly masked men in white shirts storming a mass transit station in Yuen Long, chasing passengers and beating them with sticks. Hong Kong Connection used licence plate searches to connect cars seen at Yuen Long to people involved in the attack, and revealed links between alleged attackers and influential pro-Beijing village committees. “The show revealed how police were patrolling the town before the rampage and took no action over the men wielding weapons,” RTHK said in a tweet confirming Choy’s arrest. Police were widely criticised for failing to attend emergency calls from Yuen Long for over half an hour and making no arrests on the night, prompting accusations of collusion, which were exacerbated when pictures emerged of police officers standing alongside the attackers. Police have strenuously denied the accusations of collusion. Changing and contradictory statements from police over time led to accusations they were attempting to rewrite history. RTHK’s director of broadcasting, Leung Ka-wing, said the station was “afraid”, and if the arrest was due to Choy’s reporting then it was a serious matter for the entire industry. “We are worried … whether we can continue the way we produce accurate news as before,” Leung said, but when asked if RTHK would put any current investigations on hold, he replied: “Why should we stop?” Hong Kong journalists questioned the arrest, suggesting it was an attempt to discourage reporters from accessing public records to investigate authorities. The application form to search vehicle registration records was significantly tightened this year, leaving no option for journalistic queries. “I think authorities are now exhausting every possible way to suppress the press, to make it difficult, if not impossible, for reporters to do their job to dig out the truth, to publish stories that make [the authorities] feel embarrassed,” the chair of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, Chris Yeung, told RTHK. A local news reporter, Alvin Lum, said on Twitter that Hong Kong privacy law allowed for journalistic public interest exceptions, and the arrest would set an “outrageous precedent to use of public registries and undermine transparency”. Since last year’s mass protests, and in particular since the introduction of the national security law in June, Hong Kong authorities have waged a crackdown on dissent and criticism. While this is the first time a full-time journalist has been arrested in relation to their reporting, observers have blamed the national security law for creating a chilling effect on media and academics. The public broadcaster RTHK has been under particular pressure from pro-Beijing government members and authorities. Yuen Long was the highest profile incident involving accusations or instances of police misconduct or brutality during the 2019 protests. No police officer has ever been charged, and in May an internal report by the police watchdog, the IPCC, covering the 2019 protest period, largely cleared them of any wrongdoing. The IPCC said while police were slow to act at Yuen Long, it saw no evidence of collusion between police officers and the attackers – although it acknowledged it did not have the power to investigate collusion – and said that if police had taken any arrest action it would “would only escalate the situation”.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1580,How the Vienna shooting unfolded: final hours of freedom punctured by terror,11/3/20,"Monday night in Vienna was supposed to be a last chance at freedom. The weather was mild, and as the hours ticked down before a nationwide coronavirus curfew largely shut down the city for a month, the bars and restaurants of the “Bermuda triangle” – a network of narrow, fashionable lanes in the old city’s 1st district – were busy. Diners and drinkers sat at tables outside, enjoying a last moment of revelry before another pandemic lockdown amid the full blast of winter. Without warning, at 8pm on Seitenstettengasse, a winding cobbled boulevard a block back from the Danube Canal, the shooting started.
“They were shooting at least 100 rounds just outside our building,” Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister recalled in the aftermath of the attacks that have left at least two civilians and one suspected attacker dead. He told reporters he saw, from his window above Vienna’s main synagogue, at least one person shooting at people sitting outside in the street. “All these bars have tables outside. This evening is the last evening before the lockdown,” he said. “As of midnight, all bars and restaurants will be closed in Austria for the next month, and a lot of people probably wanted to use that evening to be able to go out.” Another witness told Austria’s public broadcaster ORF that a gunman had started to fire at random at groups of people sitting at tables. “It sounded like firecrackers, then we realised it was shots,” they said. The shooter “shot wildly with an automatic weapon” before police arrived and opened fire. Footage purportedly showing the attack and shared by European counter-terrorism officers showed a puddle of blood by the entrance of a restaurant. Another unconfirmed clip showed a man carrying a rifle and wearing a white shirt and beige trousers firing shots towards a building. A male voice can be heard swearing at the suspected attacker from one of the buildings.
The shooting quickly spread to what police said were six different locations nearby. At least four people have been killed – one of them an attacker shot dead outside St Rupert’s church, carrying an assault rifle and handguns, his body strung with an explosives vest and a bag of ammunition. Police later said the vest was fake. A further 15 people were taken to hospital injured, seven of them reportedly critical. “We are victims of a despicable terror attack in the federal capital that is still ongoing,” Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said hours after the gunfire erupted. Video footage of the attack appeared to show only a single attacker, though on Monday night officials believed it was possible that several perpetrators were still on the loose. “They seem to also, as far as we know, be very well equipped, with automatic weapons,” said Kurz. “So they were very well-prepared.” ‘We were in shock’ Chris Zhao, a student, was in a restaurant on Seitenstettengasse when the attack took place. He told the BBC he heard between 20 and 30 bangs that sounded like firecrackers shortly after 8pm. The manager locked the door to the restaurant at first, but when he left, Zhao says he saw several people injured and one body. “We didn’t know what was going on,” he said. “We were in shock.” Gernot Gruber, a 25-year-old student, was caught in the Hard Rock cafe, less than 100 metres from the first attack outside the synagogue. He initially thought the bangs he heard outside were fireworks. “If you hear these noises in Austria you don’t think they’re gunshots, you really don’t,” he told the Guardian. Restaurant staff locked the doors and told people to get away from the windows before special forces police entered the building and told everyone to leave, and run towards Schwedenplatz, away from the initial attack.
Gruber said that when they emerged from the cafe, they saw police on the street corners pointing their weapons. Once the crowd had arrived at Schwedenplatz, the police asked them to raise their hands and to show they were not carrying weapons. “That is the first time police ever aimed at me with their guns,” he said. “I think that this is an experience that almost nobody who lives here has ever had before. I’ve been to several countries and have heard and watched about these attacks. But I’ve never been close to one. It was really frightening.” Lea, who only gave her first name, lives in the neighbouring 2nd district of Vienna. She said she normally spends evenings in the bustling quarter targeted by the gunman. Instead, she was at home as helicopters circled overhead. “The situation right now is really scary, my phone is ringing all the time because everyone is so worried. It’s heartbreaking. Hopefully the police can find all of the shooters and no more people have to die. But she said the Viennese would “rise stronger than ever”. “There is no place here for terrorism, neither left, right or from a religious point of view. There is a reason why everyone is saying ‘Wien ist anders’ [Vienna is different].”
As the night wore on, Vienna was placed under a new kind of lockdown. Office workers were told to sleep overnight in their buildings, while restaurants were shut and barricaded. Patrons at cinemas, the opera and theatres were held inside for hours before it was declared safe for them to go home. At the sold-out State Opera, about 1,000 spectators were informed of the attack when the director, Bogdan Roscic, stepped out in front of the stage curtain. They were eventually escorted out of the building at 11.45pm, nearly four hours after the attack began. By then public transport was not stopping in the 1st district, and taxis would not come into the quarter, making the journey home long and difficult for many. The motive for the assault remains under investigation, but by Tuesday morning, the interior minister, Karl Nehammer, said he was “certain” the attack has an Islamist motive. The gunman shot by police on Monday night is understood to be a 20-year-old with dual Austrian-Northern Macedonian citizenship, who had on 25 April 2019 been handed a 22-month prison sentence for trying to travel to Syria to join Islamic State. He was released early, in December 2019, in keeping with Austrian law covering the rights of young people. Kurz praised the police for killing one of the suspected attackers and vowed: “We will not never allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism and will fight these attacks with all means.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1581,"Hurricane Eta lashes Nicaragua, raising fears of disastrous floods",11/3/20,"Hurricane Eta, an unusually powerful storm, has slammed into Nicaragua, bringing potentially disastrous flooding to one of the country’s poorest regions. The heart of the storm begin to move inland on Tuesday, wrenching roofs off houses and causing rivers to overflow. In Puerto Cabezas on the Atlantic coast,trees were torn down and power lines were severed, plunging much of the city into darkness. About 10,000 people were in shelters in the city and an equal number in smaller towns across the region, according to city officials. “We’re really afraid, there are fallen poles, there’s flooding, roofs torn off, some of the zinc on my house fell off,” Carmen Enríquez, a resident of Puerto Cabezas told Reuters.
Hurricane Eta quickly intensified on Monday to become a category four storm, with winds of up to 145mph, according to the US National Hurricane Center. The storm could bring up to 3ft of rain, causing “catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding and river flooding, along with landslides in areas of higher terrain of Central America”, according to the NHC. After pummeling Nicaragua, Eta is expected to head through Honduras, where it will weaken in the mountains before moving on to Belize. The northern indigenous regions directly in Eta’s path are some of Nicaragua’s poorest. Many people nearby live in flimsy homes that stand little chance against such a powerful storm. “This city of 70,000 people is very vulnerable. We have houses made of wood and adobe. The infrastructure of the residential houses is our main vulnerability,” Javier Plat, a Catholic priest in Puerto Cabezas, told Reuters. Authorities in Nicaragua and Honduras had moved people on Monday from outer islands and low-lying areas to shelters. Residents scrambled to shore up their homes, but few structures along Nicaragua’s remote Caribbean coast were built to withstand such force. Nicaragua’s army moved red-helmeted troops specialized in search and rescue to Puerto Cabezas. Along Honduras’s northern Caribbean coast, torrential rains from Eta’s outer bands caused some rivers to overwhelm their banks Monday, forcing evacuations. At a shelter in Puerto Cabezas, farmer Pedro Down waited late Monday for Eta’s arrival. “When it comes it can rip off all the [roof] and destroy the house, so you have to look for a safer place,” he said, cradling a baby in his arms. “So I came here to save our lives.” On television on Monday, Nicaragua’s vice-president and first lady, Rosario Murillo, prayed for God to protect the country. She said Nicaragua would apply lessons learned from previous storms. “How many hurricanes have come and we have moved on, thanks to God,” she said. Eta is the 28th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, tying a record set in 2005. It is also the fifth to reach major hurricane status. The rapid intensification of some of these storms is consistent with the extra energy afforded them by the heating of the air and ocean through human activity, climate scientists have said. This could be only the beginning of Eta’s destruction. The storm was forecast to spend much of the week meandering over Central America.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1582,Italian doctors urge tougher restrictions fearing 'tsunami' on hospitals,11/3/20,"Italian doctors have urged the government to impose more aggressive measures to contain escalating infections over fears of a coronavirus “tsunami” on hospitals. Giuseppe Conte’s government is working towards a “light lockdown” to avoid paralysing the country, Sandra Zampa, a health ministry undersecretary said before a meeting with regional presidents to thrash out an agreement that could see shutdowns only in badly affected and at-risk regions.
Other possible measures, expected to be finalised later on Tuesday, include a 9pm nationwide curfew, a ban on travel to at-risk regions, the closure of shopping centres at weekends and closure of museums. For weeks, medics and scientists, including those advising the health ministry, have urged the government to enact tougher measures as infections escalated and hospitals came under strain. “Our worry is that this second wave won’t be a coastal storm, but a tsunami that could overwhelm the national health system,” Filippo Anelli, the president of the Italian order of doctors, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. “That’s why we’re asking the government for more aggressive measures.” Anelli said hospital beds were filling up with Covid-19 patients, reducing the ability of hospitals to guarantee care to other patients. “If we keep going like this, the situation could get out of control,” he added.
The number of people in intensive care with coronavirus has exceeded 2,000. Italian media reported in October that the government would evaluate another national lockdown if intensive care admissions eclipsed a 2,300 threshold. The daily infection rate has more than doubled since 17 October, rising by 28,244 on Tuesday. The death toll has also been increasing, with 353 more coronavirus fatalities recorded on Tuesday – the highest daily toll of the second wave so far. Zampa said the new measures would be “tailor-made” to each region. Restrictions per region could be determined by the rate of Covid-19 transmission, the number of infections and people with symptoms and the availability of hospital beds. “It will not be a rigid lockdown, but similar to the German model, light,” Zampa said. Conte said on Monday that intensive care capacity would be at risk in 15 of Italy’s 20 regions within a month unless new measures were enacted. Tuesday’s decree will be fourth in less than a month. Last week, bars and restaurants were last week forced to close from 6pm, and gyms, cinemas and theatres closed completely, sparking protests across the country. Nightly curfews are already in place in regions including Lombardy, Piedmont, Lazio and Campania. Conte has so far stopped short of ordering another national lockdown, leaving it up to regional leaders of badly-affected areas to impose one. However this provoked a battle as regional governors shied away from making unpopular decisions amid ongoing protests against restrictions. Walter Ricciardi, a scientific adviser to Italy’s health ministry, told the Guardian on Monday that the government was “wasting time”. “Like in other European countries, politicians haven’t had the courage to make prompt decisions at the right time,” he said. “Now, with every hour that passes we are moving even further towards a national lockdown.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1583,Ivory Coast president wins third term after opposition boycotts ‘sham’ election,11/3/20,"Alassane Ouattara has won a third term in power in Ivory Coast after an election boycotted by the opposition. The 78-year old president, who had once pledged to make way for a younger generation, took 94% of the vote. Two terms in office is widely seen as the limit set by the west African country’s 2016 constitution. The main opposition candidates condemned Ouattara’s attempt to win a third term as illegal and had urged their supporters to stay at home as an act of civil disobedience. Political crisis has consumed Ivory Coast since the death in July of Ouattara’s planned successor, the prime minister, Amadou Gon Coulibaly. Ouattara had been expected to leave office but reneged on his pledge, arguing the constitution did not prevent him. The disqualification of 40 opposition candidates and criticisms from his two main challengers increased tensions in a country where the spectre of electoral violence looms large. Thousands have fled to Liberia, Ghana and Togo in recent weeks, fearing the possibility of the same sort of post-election violence that killed 3,000 people in 2010. In the run-up to Saturday’s vote, protests against Ouattara had grown, particularly in opposition strongholds. Clashes with rival groups and a forceful response by security forces left at least 30 people dead, according to Amnesty International. Five more people were killed on election day. In a sign of mounting tensions over the vote, Outtara’s two main opponents said their homes had been shot at overnight. The Carter Center, a US non-governmental organisation that monitored the election, expressed “concerns that the overall context and process did not allow for a genuinely competitive election”. “The process excluded a number of Ivorian political forces and was hampered by an active boycott by a segment of the population and a volatile security environment,” it added. The electoral commission said early on Tuesday that Ouattara received 94.3% of the vote. Turnout was 53.9%, according to election officials, although the opposition has said only 10% of Ivorian voters took part. The former prime minister Pascal Affi N’Guessan, a leading opponent of Ouattara, said the result was illegitimate. “This was a sham election … marred by many irregularities and a low turnout,” he told reporters on Monday when it was clear Ouattara was going to win. N’Guessan vowed to form an alternative “transitional government”, deepening political tensions with Ouattara’s government. “The opposition parties and groups announce the creation of a council of national transition,” N’Guessan told reporters. Yet divisions within his own party, the Ivorian Popular Front, and among other senior figures in a weakened opposition, has left the plan in doubt. The president’s supporters cite a 2016 constitutional change that they say means Ouattara’s first term effectively did not count. Amid deepening insecurity across much of west Africa, third-term bids and attempts to amend national constitutions have re-emerged in recent years in Guinea, the Gambia and Ivory Coast. The moves have fuelled disillusionment, particularly among younger populations who seek greater representation in government, transparency and freedoms. Ouattara, a former rebel leader, along with both main opposition figures, the 86-year-old former president, Henri Konan Bédié, and 67-year-old N’Guessan, are among an ageing political class that have maintained their grip of Ivorian politics for years. Ouattara was the internationally recognised winner of the disputed 2010 election when the then president, Laurent Gbagbo, refused to concede defeat. Both men held their own inauguration ceremonies and the standoff persisted for months until pro-Ouattara forces captured Gbagbo from his underground bunker. Gbagbo was later acquitted of crimes against humanity at the international criminal court, though prosecutors are appealing against the decision. Critics say Ouattara’s government has failed to bring about national reconciliation, concentrating prosecutions on the crimes committed by Gbagbo loyalists. The president, an ally of western governments including the country’s former colonial power, France, enjoys international support. Yet despite significant economic growth, driven by its powerful agricultural sector, more than half of the country lives in poverty, according to the World Bank.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1584,Ministers add to confusion over England Covid lockdown rules,11/3/20,"Ministers have prompted confusion over England’s new lockdown rules with Michael Gove apologising for incorrectly indicating tennis and golf could be played, as cabinet colleague Robert Jenrick apparently wrongly suggested a family would be allowed to meet a friend for a walk outside. Amid uncertainty over the lockdown coming into effect on Thursday, Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, issued an apology for signalling that singles tennis and golf in pairs could still go ahead. It came as Jenrick, the communities secretary, confirmed that a family could go for a walk with a friend – despite there being a two-person limit on people meeting outdoors when outside of households or support bubbles.
The government’s own website detailing the restrictions states that people can exercise or visit an outdoor space “when on your own, with one person from another household”, unless an exemption applies. During a question-and-answer session with constituents on Monday, Gove said: “You’ll probably be able to play singles tennis at the moment. The guidance that we have is that if people are appropriately socially distanced they can take exercise with one other person … We are looking at allowing people to play on golf courses with one other appropriately distanced [person].”
But on Tuesday morning Gove reversed, tweeting: “My apologies, I got this wrong,” and sharing a link to guidance explaining that indoor and outdoor leisure facilities including swimming pools, golf courses and riding centres would all be forced to close from Thursday. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, Jenrick confirmed golf and tennis would not be allowed under the new rules. “There are some differences to the national measures that we had in March and April which will benefit people. For example, you are able to do unlimited outdoor exercise during this period, so we’re not going back to the time where there was only, you know, one walk a day for a limited period.
“You can go out with your own household, or with your own household plus one other person and walk the dog, go for a run, go for a walk around the town or city where you live or to the countryside...” Pressed to clarify his comments, host Louise Minchin said: “I think I heard you say that outside you can be one household, plus one other person, is that what you meant and is that right?” Jenrick replied: “Yes, that’s right.” Suggesting a scenario that would be allowed, Minchin said: “So a family could go for a walk, with for example, a friend.” Jenrick confirmed they could, saying “yes”. Pressed again by Minchin who asked whether it was correct it would apply to four people and one person, Jenrick appeared to contradict himself: “Yes, so you can go out in your own household, or with one other person.” The government’s website sets out the new rules warning people must not leave their home except for specific circumstances, including “to exercise outdoors or visit an outdoor public place - with the people you live with, with your support bubble or, when on your own, with one person from another household (children under school age, as well as those dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside)”. Tony Kerr, strategic development manager at National Tennis Association, said that Gove’s initial remarks had given “a glimmer of hope which was dashed … We don’t understand the decision and it doesn’t sound like the government understands the decision.” “Not to be able to coach even one on one, we just don’t get it,” he said, adding that NTA – a social enterprise aimed at expanding the number of people who play the sport – has “measures in place that make it completely safe. Players don’t even touch the ball with their hands when they’re getting coaching.” Hopes of a reprieve for grassroots sport during a second national lockdown were dashed by Boris Johnson on Monday. While elite sports have been given the go-ahead to continue, community sports and facilities will be forced to close. Asked in the Commons on Monday whether golf courses would be exempted from the new restrictions, the prime minister said: “I must apologise to my honourable friend for not being able to offer the house a huge list of exemptions to the rules we’ve set out. Because once you unpick at one thing alas the effectiveness of the whole package is compromised. “That’s why I want everyone to work together for the next four weeks to get the R rate under control so that we can open things up again in time for December.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1585,Police attend Zizzi restaurant in Bristol over alleged Covid test breach,11/3/20,"A Zizzi restaurant near Bristol was closed after police investigated reports of staff being allegedly ordered to come into work while awaiting coronavirus test results. One staff member was also purportedly warned, incorrectly, that they would not receive statutory sick pay of £92 a week if they stayed home after they expressed anxiety over working due to the suspected cases. The Italian chain restaurant in Clifton village reopened on Monday after deep cleaning following its closure on Thursday afternoon, after staff had raised the alarm to police. A sign on the door over the weekend said: “Due to a technical issue we are now closed. We do apologise for any inconvenience caused.” Avon and Somerset police said: “We received a call on Thursday 29 October amid reports of two members of staff at Zizzi’s restaurant in Clifton failing to self-isolate the previous day. Two officers from our Covid team attended and the premises was shut. “We have made Public Health England and the local authority’s environmental health team aware.” There was no suggestion of any contraventions of Covid guidelines at other Zizzi branches across the UK. A source familiar with the matter told the Guardian: “A manager told staff to go to work while awaiting test results. One staff member was also told if they didn’t go to work they wouldn’t receive statutory sick pay. One asymptomatic staff member received a positive test result text while they were at work and didn’t go home.” They said a member of kitchen staff had also been at work exhibiting symptoms of a fever, but was not sent home. Another asymptomatic person continued to work after their partner had tested positive.
The source said the events raised serious questions over the Zizzi branch’s treatment of staff and its apparent lack of consideration about customer wellbeing. The managing director, Harry Heeley, said in a company update video on Friday: “It is key to remember that our focus as a team and as a business remains to protect the Zizzi team and business through these challenging and difficult times.” He added: “We must not forget that the majority of our sites are performing comparatively well, demonstrating that where people are able to visit us they still love our brands and our teams, and will keep coming back.” The Azzurri Group, owner of Zizzi, Ask Italian and Coco di Mama, was taken over by the investment firm TowerBrook Capital Partners from the UK private-equity firm Bridgepoint in July. Across the group, 75 restaurants were subsequently closed after cost-cutting, with 1,200 jobs lost. A spokesperson for Zizzi said: “We have clear Covid measures in place to protect the wellbeing of our customers and our teams, however on this occasion our strict protocols have not been adhered to. “As soon as we discovered this, we acted decisively to voluntarily close the restaurant, with all team members self-isolating, and there is an ongoing internal investigation into the mistakes that were made.” Zizzi has not been asked to provide customer details from NHS test and trace or public health to help trace people who visited the restaurant last week. This may be because it has not been identified as the location of a potential Covid outbreak. A Bristol city council spokesperson said: “Environmental health officers are working closely with the police and Public Health England to ensure the premises at Zizzi’s Clifton is Covid-secure and adhering to test and trace and self-isolation requirements.” • This article was amended on 6 November 2020 because an earlier version referred to TowerBrookCapital Partners as a “US investment firm”.

1586,Protest exemption set to be removed from England lockdown rules,11/3/20,"Protections for protesters are set to be removed from the coronavirus rules under the second national lockdown, it has emerged, provoking anger from human rights groups and campaigners. An exemption that permits demonstrations to take place with additional conditions designed to mitigate the spread of the virus is expected to be omitted from fresh regulations being drawn up for the lockdown that will commence from this Thursday. There have been a series of a high-profile protests since the pandemic erupted in the UK including rallies for racial equality led by the Black Lives Matter movement, racist counter-demonstrations and marches against lockdown measures directed by conspiracy theorists and extremists. While there will be no explicit ban on protests in the regulations, the removal of the exemption will render organising large-scale lawful protest almost impossible. The expected move, first revealed by the Times, has been met with fierce criticism from campaigners and human rights groups. Tyrek Morris, the co-founder of All Black Lives UK, a youth-led campaign group born out of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, said: “With regards to protesting, and protesting through the pandemic, one thing that is clear, we have no support from the government in any way shape or form.” Morris said protests organised by All Black Lives UK had faced a heavy handed response, despite meeting the criteria set out by the exemption. “Since the BLM movement arose again, the government has been completely against our protest, against protest full stop, and at every chance possible have tried to stop us. But we’ve always found a way around it. They could stop us protesting, but they can’t stop us fighting for our own rights.”
Morris said criticism of the current government was implicit in the All Black Lives UK protests. “We have criticism for the way the government has mishandled the coronavirus pandemic, for how black people are more likely to suffer from this pandemic, we’ve been very vocal about Boris Johnson and his racist tendencies, his previous comments. So this does not come as a shock to me. They don’t want to hear us talk.” Rosalind Comyn, the policy and campaigns manager at Liberty, the human rights group, said: “We should all be able to stand up for what we believe in. In a healthy democracy protest is one way we do that, and that’s why any measures which stop people expressing dissent are deeply worrying and should be treated with suspicion. “We have always supported proportionate measures to protect lives, but people must not be criminalised en masse for voicing opposition to government action – even in the context of a pandemic. What’s more, parliament has been sidelined at every turn of this government’s pandemic response, making protest even more important than ever to ensure everyone’s voices are heard. “The government and police must commit to uphold their duty to facilitate protest so we can stand up to power.” A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion UK, which has staged climate protests since the pandemic outbreak, said: “Only a government keenly aware of its epic failing would bring in such extreme restrictions to protest. “These are the actions of a government not willing to listen to its citizens. Studies over the last year have found that protests held outdoors do not lead to spikes in infection rates. This is clearly a political choice at a time when the government needs to be held to account on many fronts.” When the regulations were refreshed for the new three-tiered system in England, the wording explicitly said a clause about gatherings of more than six was applicable to protests. The clause in effect permitted individuals to gather in a group of more than six for the purposes of protest as long as the following rules were satisfied: The gathering has been organised by a business, a charity, a benevolent or philanthropic institution, a public body, or a political body. The organiser of the protest has carried out a risk assessment that meets the requirements of the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999. The organiser has taken all reasonable steps to limit the risk of transmission of coronavirus, in line with the risk assessment and with any relevant government guidance. But while the clause remains in the new lockdown regulations, which were published late on Tuesday, the explicit reference to “protests” has vanished.
Whitehall sources told the Guardian the change was spearheaded by the Covid-19 taskforce and was designed to make the rules simpler. But a senior police source told the Guardian they feared being “left in the middle” by any dropping of the protections for protests and also would rather there was a clear-cut regulation, rather than something vague and open to interpretation. “It’s going to be difficult,” the source said. Police are saying they are already under strain from trying to impose existing Covid regulations, with regular crime returning to normal levels, having plunged during the first lockdown. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The right to peaceful protest is one of the cornerstones of our democracy. In these unprecedented circumstances, any gathering risks spreading the disease, leading to more deaths, so it is vital we all play our part in controlling the virus. “People must follow the rules on meeting with others, which apply to all gatherings and therefore protests too. As they have done throughout the pandemic, the police and local authorities will engage, explain and encourage people to follow the rules before moving on to enforce the law.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1587,Retail and hospitality in England open extra hours before lockdown,11/3/20,"Retailers, hairdressers and restaurants in England have said they are extending opening hours and seeing their strongest bookings in months, as Thursday’s lockdown looms. Gary Grant, the chairman of toyshop chain The Entertainer, said shoppers were “clearing the shelves like it’s Christmas Eve” with sales on Monday double that of the equivalent day last year. The chain is extending opening hours until 7pm or 8pm from 5.30pm as it expects strong trading to continue right up until Wednesday night. From Thursday, nonessential retail in England will close for a month, along with gyms, cinemas, hospitality venues and places of worship. Dixons, the owner of PC World, Currys and Carphone Warehouse, and some branches of bookseller Waterstones are also extending opening hours ahead of four weeks of closure in what would normally be a peak trading period. Queues formed outside Primark in some cities over the weekend as the chain, which does not sell online, prepared to close its doors on Thursday. Across England there was a near 9% rise in shopper numbers compared with the previous week. However, the number of high street visitors is still well down on last year, including 45% down in central London. Jace Tyrrell, the chief executive of the New West End Company trade body for London retailers, described the scene as a “mini rush”. “It’s been one of the best Sundays since we reopened,” he said. “I think people want to get some shopping done as they are not certain shops are going to reopen in December.” Hairdressers around the country were also busy. Regis, which owns 56 hair salons, said bookings were up 30% since the lockdown announcement on Saturday and the 60-strong Saks hairdressing chain said it had extended opening hours to include Sunday, early mornings and late evenings to cope with demand. Janet King, the head of marketing at Saks, said: “Phones are ringing off the hook and our online booking app has struggled a little with the volume of traffic.” Darren Messias, the managing director of KH Hair Salons, said its 20 salons in the Midlands would be doing a week’s appointments in three days by bringing in extra staff and opening late in some cases as clients booked in for emergency dyes and trims. “The fear is that the government might extend the lockdown. People are panicking about getting their colours done for Christmas,” he said. Pubs were also expecting a late rush. Peter Borg-Neal, the chief executive of Oakman Inns, said its 28 pubs were fully booked through to Wednesday night, from when the group will only be able to sell takeaway meals. He said the group was hoping to sell as much beer as possible before the lockdown as pubs will not be able to sell takeaway alcohol from Thursday as they were allowed to do in the spring lockdown. “We will have a big lump of stock left over. Probably 200 pints per pub. Why don’t they at least let us try to make some form of living. Why do they always favour the supermarkets?” Borg-Neal said. Restaurants also reported a surge in bookings. Gaucho said it had taken 8,000 bookings for its steakhouses on Sunday, four times its usual number, while Rick Stein Group said its bookings on Sunday were up by 25% week on week. Ben Tish, the culinary director of hotel and restaurant owner The Stafford Collection, said its Norma restaurant in central London was fully booked for evenings until Thursday with minimal space at lunches. “People absolutely want their last hurrah,” he said.
Many galleries, museums and arts venues also reported a rise in inquiries from those wanting a last minute cultural hit. The Wigmore Hall in London, for example, experienced a flood of phone calls about coming to what is the final performance in its series to socially distanced audiences. “People are desperate to get in,” said the artistic director, John Gilhooly, “but unfortunately they can’t because we’re sold out.” Instead, they can watch the free live stream of a grimly appropriate last performance: Schubert’s Winterreise (Winter Journey), a downbeat song cycle about entering the abyss. “Hopefully that’s not where we’re heading,” said Gilhooly. All the business owners said the short-term surge in trade would not offset a difficult year with the latest four-week shutdown a further blow after at least three months of closure from March. “This year is going to be shocking,” said Messias at KH. “Everybody is in the same boat. The high street is being absolutely murdered. It is very, very tough.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1588,Rich states' Covid deals 'may deprive poor of vaccine for years',11/3/20,"Governments in predominantly wealthy countries are negotiating to buy nearly 8.8bn doses of prospective Covid-19 vaccines in a “frenzy of deals” that could mean many poor countries would not get access to immunisation until at least 2024, a report says. None of the 320-plus potential vaccines in development have been approved for use, but countries have already struck advance purchasing agreements for 3.73bn doses of the most promising candidates, with negotiations underway for another 5bn doses, the study by Duke University’s global health innovation centre calculated. However, manufacturers will only be able to produce so much of the successful candidates, with researchers estimating it could take three to four years to supply enough vaccine to immunise the global population. That means many wealthy countries may be able to vaccinate their entire populations several times over before most people in low-income countries are immunised, the report said. “Countries are acting in their own interests, which makes senses,” said Andrea Taylor, an assistant director at the Duke centre. “The problem it leads to is a pattern of behaviour globally where we are limited in the number of doses we can produce in the first year or two … And so many are getting taken off the market and snatched up and reserved for high-income countries, leaving potentially very little for low- and middle-income countries.” The World Health Organization has overseen the creation of a scheme called Covax in which signatory countries can access an equal share of successful vaccine candidates – first for healthcare and security workers and eventually for a minimum of 20% of their populations. But many wealthy countries had invested in the Covax facility and struck their own deals directly with pharmaceutical companies, Taylor said, cutting down on the pool of doses that would be equitably distributed. “They’re giving with one hand and taking with the other,” Taylor said. Ethiopia, for example, will receive enough doses of successful vaccines to cover 20% of its population under Covax, but has not struck any other side deals, meaning most of its citizens could go unvaccinated for years after British residents have been immunised. Another issue facing poorer countries is that some lack cold-chain supply infrastructure and so will be unable to access vaccine candidates that require storage in freezing temperatures, or others that need to be stored in high heat. The first hundreds of millions of doses of a Johnson & Johnson candidate that can be stored for several months at normal fridge temperatures – easing its rollout in poorer countries – have already been purchased in large numbers by the US, UK, EU and Canada, the report said. The study confirmed that Covax has purchased enough vaccine so far to immunise about 250 million people – well short of the 1.14 billion people it has pledged to cover. Australia, which has agreed to purchase more than 80m doses of prospective vaccines, is one of the few wealthy countries so far to pledge to share its supply, in this case with smaller neighbouring countries, such as Vanuatu and Fiji. Taylor said the report was intended as a warning and that the situation could be alleviated if manufacturing capacity improved significantly or wealthy countries agreed to make their excess supplies available through the Covax facility. Public health experts have said the pandemic could be needlessly prolonged by “vaccine nationalism”, with countries hoarding their supplies or placing export controls on critical equipment or ingredients.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1589,Russian 'Sausage King' investigators find man handcuffed to bed,11/3/20,"An investigation into the crossbow murder of a Russian sausage magnate has taken a bizarre turn, as police searching a suspect’s home for clues instead found a man handcuffed to a bedpost. Investigators said the man, whom they described as a pensioner, was being held captive and extorted to sign over his apartment, indicating a wider criminal ring behind the grisly murder of the oligarch Vladimir Marugov on Monday.
Police have arrested two suspects in connection with the killing of the “Sausage King”, which has prompted comparisons with violent attacks on entrepreneurs from Russia’s rough-and-tumble 1990s. But another suspect remains at large. Marugov, 54, and his partner, whom Russian media have named as Sabina Gaziyeva, were in the sauna at his estate near Moscow when two masked attackers broke in, bound the pair with rope, and demanded money. Gaziyeva managed to escape through a window and summon police. By the time they arrived at the house, however, Marugov had been shot dead and the killers had fled. The getaway car was later discovered in a nearby village. Inside it, police found masks, the crossbow used in the attack and several bolts. Marugov was a prominent businessman who owned some of the country’s largest meat-processing plants, including one that translates as Meat Empire. He had made headlines in 2018 for publicly feuding with his ex-wife, the poet Tatyana Marugova, over a divorce settlement. His son Alexander died in a motorcycle crash last year. Investigators have arrested one of the two suspected attackers. A representative for Russia’s Investigative Committee said in a statement that he “acquired the crossbow in a shop in Moscow and was directly involved in the attack on the businessman”. The suspect, who has not been identified, has refused to cooperate with the investigation. On Tuesday, investigators said they raided an apartment belonging to the suspect and discovered a pensioner handcuffed to a bedpost. The man told police he was being held against his will and had been pressured to sign over his Moscow apartment. The man may have been under the influence of “a psychotropic substance”, the Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported. Police arrested another person at the scene who had apparently been guarding the prisoner. The man was later identified by Russian state media as Alexei Zavgorodniy, a lawyer best known for representing a notorious mafia hitman in the 1990s. The contract killer Alexander Solonik, was better known as Sasha the Macedonian for his superior marksmanship with pistols in both hands (known as “Macedonian style” in Russian). Solonik was linked to dozens of killings and had escaped from prison three times before he was strangled to death by another well-known hitman, Alexander Pustovalov. Investigators wrote that they believed the suspect in Marugov’s killing was also involved in defrauding Muscovites of their valuable apartments. Police are still seeking a second murder suspect in the case.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1590,Spain's former king Juan Carlos faces new corruption allegations,11/3/20,"Spain’s attorney general has instructed supreme court prosecutors to investigate new corruption allegations against the country’s disgraced former king. Juan Carlos, who abdicated in 2014, is already under investigation over his alleged role in a deal under which a Spanish consortium won a €6.7bn (£5.9bn) contract to build a high-speed rail line in Saudi Arabia. Reports emerged in March suggesting Juan Carlos had received a $100m (€88m) payment from Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah in 2008, three years before the contract was awarded. The king was covered by constitutional immunity while on the throne, but lost the protection when he stepped down to make way for his son, King Felipe. The attorney general’s office did not give details of the new investigation, but said in a statement on Tuesday that a decree had been issued instructing anti-corruption and organised crime prosecutors to hand over their reports on the former king to supreme court prosecutors “so that they can continue the investigations until their conclusion”. The announcement came hours after the online newspaper ElDiario.es broke news that anti-corruption prosecutors were investigating Juan Carlos, his wife Sofía and other members of the royal family over the use of credit cards linked to accounts not held in their names. According to Eldiario.es, the transactions under investigation took place between 2016 and 2018, after Juan Carlos forfeited his immunity. He abdicated after a string of damaging scandals that culminated in a controversial elephant-hunting trip to Botswana while Spain was devastated by the effects of the 2008 financial crisis. But the scandals have refused to die down. Felipe stripped Juan Carlos of his annual stipend in March and renounced his personal inheritance from his father after reports that he was in line to receive millions of euros from a secret offshore fund with ties to Saudi Arabia. The supreme court prosecutor said three months later that an investigation had been opened into “the second phase of the construction of a high-speed rail line to join the cities of Medina and Mecca” and was intended to “define or discard the criminal relevance of events that occurred after June 2014”, when Juan Carlos’simmunity ended. Prosecutors in Switzerland are looking into a number of accounts the former monarch and his alleged associates held in the country. It is alleged in documents from the Swiss prosecutor that Juan Carlos received a $100m “donation” from the king of Saudi Arabia that he put in an offshore account in 2008. He allegedly gifted €65m from the account to his former lover, Corinna Larsen, four years later. Spain’s El Confidencial website reported in July that Juan Carlos had withdrawn €100,000 a month from the account between 2008 and 2012, and used the money to pay for some of the royal family’s expenses. Juan Carlos has said that he never told his son he was set to benefit from two offshore funds, but has made no further comment on the allegations. He announced in August that he was going into exile to protect his son from further embarrassment. In a letter sent to Felipe and released by the royal house, Juan Carlos said he would move from Spain because of the “public repercussions that certain past events in my private life are causing”.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1591,Spanish police seize 1.2 tonnes of cocaine on ship busted for second time in two weeks,11/3/20,"Spanish police have seized more than 1.2 tonnes of cocaine on a ship carrying corn from Brazil, two weeks after their Brazilian counterparts confiscated 1.5 tonnes of the drug from the same vessel. A team of customs agents and Guardia Civil and national police officers intercepted the Unispirit 50 nautical miles off the island of Gran Canaria on 16 October, and after escorting the vessel into port they conducted a painstaking five-day search of its cargo. Hidden among sacks containing 3,500 tonnes of corn, they found 1,210kg of cocaine. The Spanish operation began following a tip-off from Brazilian federal police, who had discovered 1,524kg of cocaine hidden inside 15 sacks while the Unispirit was being loaded with its cargo at the south-eastern port of São Sebastião. “At the beginning of the month, the ship continued its journey towards the Spanish port of Cádiz, which included a stop in the port of Las Palmas” in Gran Canaria, the Guardia Civil and national police said in a joint statement. “There were still suspicions that there could have been more drugs concealed aboard. The Brazilian federal police told Spanish police that the ship had left port in strange circumstances before the Brazilian search had been completed. As a result, they asked customs agents and officers from the national police and the Guardia Civil to take another look at the cargo once it reached Spain.” The second inspection turned up 12 further sacks that concealed cocaine. A spokeswoman for the national police said the investigation was ongoing and that no arrests had been made. Police intercepted a “narco-submarine” off the coast of Galicia in north-west Spain in November last year, and seized 3 tonnes of cocaine following a joint operation with police forces from the UK, Portugal, the US and Brazil.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1592,Students defy guidance and race home before lockdown in England,11/3/20,"Students are defying government guidance that they should stay at university throughout lockdown to make a last-minute dash home before the new restrictions kick in across England on Thursday. The universities minister, Michelle Donelan, has written to students urging them to stay put. After a challenging first term, during which thousands of students have already had to lock down and self-isolate as a result of Covid outbreaks, many have decided to leave campus. With continuing uncertainty about what might happen over Christmas and the majority of learning now online, they plan to continue their studies at home during lockdown without fear of being trapped at university over the holiday. Donelan’s letter, however, stated: “You should not leave your term-time address to return to your parents or carers’ home until at least 2 December and should continue to learn at university for the remainder of this term.
“The reason we are asking you to remain at your university and not to travel home before the new restrictions come into place on Thursday is to prevent any further spread of Covid-19. Any movement around the country will risk the lives of our loved ones. “I know and appreciate that a number of you may want to be back with your family during this difficult time, but I urge you to stay where you are in order to save lives.” One mother of a first-year student agreed with the government that it was best for students was to remain on campus, but said: “I am already hearing that some students have left uni halls over the weekend to travel home and more are planning to ‘escape’ by the end of 4 November, including my son who is adamant he is coming home. He said, ‘I’m coming home, Mum. I’m not staying here on my own. Everyone’s going’.”
Lockdown discussions were also under way on the Student Room online forum. One participant who has decided to go home said: “Even before the lockdown was announced my entire course was pretty much all online – only five in-person sessions over the 10 weeks of term – so I’m not missing out on anything academically. Socially, there are no in-person society events either. So this year sucks.” Others who have already left for reading week are not planning to return. Larissa Kennedy, the president of the National Union of Students said: “If I were at university right now, I would not be staying. It’s not feasible for students, many of whom have already been in lockdown for weeks, to continue to be completely isolated over the next month. It could potentially be longer than that. Does that then roll into the end of term and into Christmas?
“Mental health is my key concern. We have already lost one member of the student community to anxiety around lockdown,” she said, referring to the death last month of 19-year-old Finn Kitson, a student at Manchester University. The government recommended before lockdown that students should stay at university and not travel home, but it has not been made a legal requirement. The lockdown guidance published by the Department for Education on Tuesday says students must stay at their university address for the duration and will only be able to go out for the same specific reasons as the rest of the population. The NUS, however, has called on the government to provide guidance on how students can leave university safely, both now and at the end of term. The government has said it is committed to getting students home for Christmas but is still to publish details. In a separate letter to vice-chancellors, Donelan said she wanted all students to have some form of face-to-face learning. It follows earlier guidance from the Cabinet Office that universities “should consider moving to increased levels of online learning where possible” during the four-week lockdown.",,Foreign,Guardian,4

1594,"UK can expect at least three Covid waves with lockdowns, Mordaunt says",11/3/20,"The UK should be braced for at least a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic and further lockdowns, a minister has said as Tory sceptics warned they would not vote to extend England’s four-week shutdown. Penny Mordaunt, the paymaster general, told MPs on Tuesday that there could yet be a rolling series of lockdowns – but argued this was not evidence that the measure was ineffective. It came as the former chief whip, Mark Harper, criticised a lack of engagement with Conservative backbenchers before a Commons vote on England’s lockdown on Wednesday, and said the government would be forced to rely on Labour votes to pass any extension beyond 2 December. Ministers expect a moderate number of Conservative MPs to rebel but Labour support means the measures are guaranteed to pass.
Speaking in parliament, Mordaunt said the government was “hopeful of being able to unlock in December but they are being driven by the data”. She said cases would inevitably rise after restrictions are lifted, and a high proportion of the population will remain vulnerable to the virus. “That is why some scientists expect a third or more waves of the virus to be managed [with] repeat lockdowns. Others argue that the need for future lockdowns is evidence they don’t work but that’s to misunderstand what they are there to do,” she said. “This approach buys us time and is the optimum use of the healthcare we have in the meantime while capacity is built and vaccines are sought.” Her remarks contrasted with those of Boris Johnson, who was bullish that England’s lockdown would end on 2 December, telling a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that this was a hard deadline to develop a new solution to contain the spread of the virus. The prime minister also appeared to affirm that the government expected the four-week lockdown to be enough to get the virus’s R number below 1 – raising questions as to whether the lockdown would be extended should that not occur. “Once again we are, alas, asking everybody to stay at home to protect the NHS, to save lives, and get the R down below 1. I know we can, I know we will. It’s only just above 1 at the moment,” he said. Harper said he had not received the reassurances he had repeatedly requested about the projections used by Johnson to justify the lockdown. He said he had not yet decided whether to support the government on Wednesday but predicted most colleagues would reluctantly back the plan, though the prime minister would struggle to secure support for any extension next month. “If the government do need to extend these measures, I think it’s very clear that they would end up depending on the votes of the Labour party – and prime ministers who end up depending on the opposition tend to end badly, in my experience.” James Grundy, the MP for Leigh in Greater Manchester – Andy Burnham’s old seat and a Labour stronghold for 114 years until December – said he planned to vote against the government unless financial support improved significantly or there was a clear timetable for a vaccine. “A rolling series of lockdowns might … hold Covid-19 at bay for a few weeks, or months, as the last one did. Then again, it might not. It certainly will cause absolute devastation to every other part of our society though,” he said. Conservative lockdown sceptics criticised the government’s strategy during a debate in Westminster Hall, to which Mordaunt was responding. The backbencher Richard Drax said the government had overreacted to the pandemic. “A draconian, onerous and invasive set of rules and regulations now govern our very existence,” he said. “I cannot recall a moment in our proud island history where our nation has been so cowed to the extent it is now.” The Tory MP Bob Seeley said anyone who believed restrictions would end on 2 December was “living in a parallel universe … You really wonder if the government is losing the plot over this.” Chris Green, the Conservative MP for Bolton, said the response had been “erratic”, and the regional tiered system had not been given enough time to have an effect.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1595,UK coronavirus: Whitty says aim of lockdown is to reduce R enough to move on after 2 December – as it happened,11/3/20,"Prof Chris Whitty, the governmentâ€™s chief medical adviser, has told MPs there is a â€œrealistic possibilityâ€� that the lockdown for England can be eased after 2 December. Asked if the restrictions would definitely be lifted then, as planned by the government, Whitty said: The decision as to whether to lift restrictions on December 2 is rightly a decision for ministers and parliament. I think that the aim of this is to get the rates down far enough that itâ€™s a realistic possibility to move into a different state of state of play at that point in time. But he also said he did not expect England to return to the exact tiering system in place now. He said: I think that the prime minister would probably want us to look at whether there should be variations on exactly the same tiering system as at the moment, rather than just assuming we would just revert to an absolutely identical one. I think thereâ€™s a lot to learn. And in fact, the next two or three weeks we will start to see the effects of the tiering in an even more granular way than weâ€™ve got to date and I think we should wait until we got that before we start to decide how best to use that in future. Boris Johnson has told the cabinet that Englandâ€™s lockdown restrictions will come to an end on 2 December, saying that was a hard deadline to develop a new solution to contain the spread of the virus. Students are defying government guidance that they should stay at university throughout lockdown to make a last-minute dash home before the new restrictions kick in across England on Thursday. Englandâ€™s most senior faith leaders have challenged the governmentâ€™s decision to ban communal worship during the second lockdown, telling Boris Johnson there is no scientific basis for the move. The number of people in the UK earning below the minimum wage has more than quadrupled to 2 million since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to official figures, as the lowest-paid workers in Britain suffer the most financial damage. Prof Tim Spector, who runs the Covid symptom study (CSS), has said his latest figures suggest coronavirus cases in England, Wales and Scotland are plateauing, with R, the reproduction number, now at about 1. The CSS monitors the spread of the virus through an app, with 4m downloads, which people use to report symptoms.
Ministers have prompted confusion over Englandâ€™s new lockdown rules with Michael Gove apologising for incorrectly indicating tennis and golf could be played, as cabinet colleague Robert Jenrick apparently wrongly suggested a family would be allowed to meet a friend for a walk outside. The terrorism threat in the UK has been upgraded to severe in the aftermath of the terror attack in Vienna overnight and a string of violent incidents in France, the government has announced.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1596,"UK will struggle to deal with Brexit alongside Covid, says thinktank",11/3/20,"Devolved administrations, local authorities and businesses risk being overwhelmed by Brexit implementation on 1 January, unable to deal with it alongside the urgent demands of the second wave of Covid-19, an influential thinktank has said. Local councils, trading standards officers and port health authorities are all part of the Brexit operation but may find themselves stretched because of the resurgence of the virus, the Institute for Government said. “The pandemic will make these plans harder. For example, critical staff may fall ill or need to isolate and resources may well be redirected to the pandemic response. “And although central government has managed to shift resources back to Brexit preparations after they were redeployed to help with the pandemic earlier this year, there is less capacity among the devolved governments and local authorities to handle both,” says report titled Brexit: How Ready is the UK? While the UK faces a challenging winter, cooperation with local administrations will be more critical than ever not least to understand how the double shock of Covid and Brexit is playing out in key areas including ports, airports and key industries that rely on cross-border supply chains or workforces. The report comes a day after the National Institute for Economic and Social Research warned that Brexit “on top of Covid-19 is likely to broaden the shock to growth and employment in the first quarter of 2021, weakening the UK’s recovery compared with other countries, and reducing productivity in the long run”. Authors of the IfG report commend the government on getting most of the required legislation including the new immigration and agriculture bills through by the end of the year. But questions remain. With less than 60 days to go, the government has yet to announce how the UK prosperity fund will work, how it will replace EU funding whether for science or economic development, says the report. It also predicts that the Northern Ireland protocol cannot be implement in full on time with the IT systems and infrastructure for new border control posts not ready for 1 January. This will present the government with a challenge to apply the “the letter” of the withdrawal agreement and risk lorry queues in ports such as Liverpool or facilitate the flow of goods without the new regulatory and customs checks in place and risk ending up in the European court of justice. While trust between the EU and the UK has been badly damaged over Boris Johnson’s threat to “disapply” some of the withdrawal agreement, the IfG believes if the offending clauses in the internal market bill are dropped, the EU should “be ready to show some flexibility” on the Northern Ireland protocol. On border readiness elsewhere in the country, the IfG says “more work is needed” to help business prepare for the new controls which many do not realise apply whether there is a trade deal or not. “The economic damage wrought by coronavirus has robbed many of the bandwidth, and cash, to do what is needed,” it says adding that as recently as late October one third of small businesses were still labouring under the illusion that the transition period would be extended beyond 31 December. It also criticised the government’s communications campaign as concentrating on the opportunities of Brexit rather than making a call to action for businesses. And it warns that while Whitehall may have the resources and separate work streams on Brexit, Westminster should not be complacent. “Even if the UK civil service has the necessary resources to do so, the devolved administrations, local authorities and businesses may well be overwhelmed,” it says.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1597,Vienna attack: arrests made after four killed in 'Islamist terror' shooting,11/3/20,"Austrian police have made several arrests at addresses linked to an Islamic State sympathiser who killed at least four people in a terrorist shooting and stabbing attack in Vienna on Monday night. Two men and two women died of their injuries after the attack in the centre of the Austrian capital, which took place hours before a coronavirus lockdown started. The 20-year-old suspect, Kujtim Fejzulai, who was shot dead by police nine minutes into the attack, was convicted last year for membership of Isis after being arrested on his way to Syria to join the group, officials said. Fejzulai, who was born in Vienna and held joint Austrian and North Macedonian citizenship, was released early from a 22-month prison sentence in December. Late on Tuesday Isis claimed responsibility for the attack without providing evidence, in a statement by its Amaq News Agency posted on Telegram. The victims were “an elderly man, an elderly woman, a young male passerby and a waitress”, according to Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz. He praised a police officer shot in the attack and who is in a critical but stable condition as brave. Kurz said the entire country had been the target of the attack. He called the murders “cold-blooded” and pledged that everything would be done to pursue those behind them. “The enemy, the Islamist terror, wants to split our society, but we will give no space to this hatred,” he said. “Our enemies are not the members of a religious community, these are terrorists. This is not a fight between Christians and Muslims, or Austrians and migrants, but a fight between civilisation and barbarity.”
Austria’s president, Alexander Van der Bellen, said the nation’s tears were flowing for the victims and their relatives. He said the attack had targeted “life in a liberal democracy which terrorists clearly hate deeply”. Twenty-two people were injured with gunshot and knife wounds, of whom three were in a critical condition. The attacker had been armed with an automatic rifle, a hand gun and a machete, and had been wearing a fake suicide vest. He had posted a photograph of himself with the weapons on his Instagram account before the attack, according to the interior minister, Karl Nehammer. Fourteen people associated with the assailant have been detained for questioning in searches on 18 properties in and near Vienna. Following conflicting reports overnight, Nehammer said on Tuesday afternoon that evidence gathered so far showed no indication that there was a second assailant. The shooting began at 8pm on Monday evening near Vienna’s main synagogue, as many people were enjoying a last night of open restaurants and bars before a month-long coronavirus lockdown, which started at midnight.
Police were trawling through more than 20,000 videos filmed by members of the public to determine the exact course of events. They urged people to resist posting video footage on social media. Hundreds of people were still taking refuge in cafes, bars and Austria’s national theatre early Tuesday morning. The city centre remained closed off, with 1,000 police officers patrolling the streets. Concertgoers were shown being escorted from the opera house under police protection on Monday night. Several hotels reportedly gave free accommodation to both Vienna residents and tourists who were stranded in the city. People in Vienna were urged to stay at home on Tuesday. Schools outside the city centre were open, but parents were urged to keep their children at home if possible. Border checks have been increased.
The attack began just hours before Austria introduced new coronavirus restrictions at midnight on Monday, including an 8pm to 6am curfew. Bars and restaurants in the network of narrow streets known to locals as the “Bermuda triangle” were packed. A witness said a gunman had started to fire at random at groups of people sitting at tables. “They were shooting at least 100 rounds just outside our building,” Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister said. He told reporters that from his window above Vienna’s main synagogue, he saw at least one person shooting at people sitting outside in the street. “All these bars have tables outside. This evening is the last evening before the lockdown,” he said. “As of midnight, all bars and restaurants will be closed in Austria for the next month, and a lot of people probably wanted to use that evening to be able to go out.” Footage purportedly showing the attack and shared by European counter-terrorism agencies showed a man carrying a rifle and wearing a white shirt and beige trousers firing shots toward a building. A male voice can be heard swearing at the attacker from one of the buildings. Initial reports had suggested that the nearby Stadttempel synagogue could have been the target of the attack, but Oskar Deutsch, the president of the Jewish Community Vienna, said the synagogue on Seitenstettengasse and the office building at the same address were already closed at the time of the attack. It was unclear if it had been a target, he said. The Israelitische Kultusgemeinde, the organisation that represents Austria’s Jewish community, said it had closed all its synagogues and facilities including schools, restaurants and cultural centres nationwide. Security has been stepped up at Jewish establishments across the country. The IKG’s counselling service had been inundated with requests for help from distressed community members, Erich Nuler, the organisation’s crisis committee spokesman said.

The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said the victims were an older man, an older woman, a young passerby and a waitress. He described an injured police officer who tried to stop the attacker as brave. The army has been deployed in the capital to back up law enforcement, as a widespread search took place on Tuesday.

1599,Vienna shooting: what we know so far about the attack,11/3/20,"Five people have died in an attack in Vienna on Monday night, including two male civilians and two female, and one gunman who was killed by police. Twenty-two people were injured with gunshot and knife wounds, of whom three are in a critical condition. Authorities described the attacker as a 20-year-old “Islamist terrorist” with North Macedonian and Austrian citizenship. The suspect was convicted last year for membership of Islamic State after being arrested on his way to Syria to join the group, officials said. The man, who also possessed an Austrian passport, was released early from a 22-month prison sentence in December. Fourteen people associated with the assailant have been detained for questioning in searches on 18 properties in and near Vienna. There is no indication of a second assailant, the interior minister, Karl Nehammer, said on Tuesday afternoon, after conflicting reports overnight. Authorities are examining more than 20,000 pieces of video footage uploaded to them by members of the public to determine how many gunmen were involved and the exact course of events. The attack began shortly after 8pm with volleys of gunfire. The suspect was shot by police nine minutes into the attack outside St Rupert’s church, carrying an assault rifle, a handgun and a machete. His body was also found with a fake explosives vest. The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, described the assaults as “definitely” a terror attack that had been “very professionally” planned. Kurz has called the military on to the streets of Vienna.
Early reports suggested the nearby Stadttempel synagogue could have been the target of the attack. But Oskar Deutsch, the president of Vienna’s Jewish community, said the synagogue on Seitenstettengasse was closed at the time of the attack. He told the Kurier newspaper it was “unclear” if it was a target. The attack occurred on the last night before a new coronavirus lockdown was due to come into force in the city.

1600,Zimbabwe journalist Hopewell Chin'ono arrested again,11/3/20,"Hopewell Chin’ono, the Zimbabwean journalist and anti-corruption campaigner has has been rearrested for allegedly breaking bail conditions. Police and officials took Chin’ono from his home in the capital, Harare, on Tuesday evening. Legal sources said he had been charged with contempt of court relating to an alleged breach of bail conditions, an allegation that they described as “nonsense”. Chin’ono, a respected documentary-maker who has worked for a number of international organisations, was first arrested in July after publishing a series of investigations into corruption in Zimbabwe. He was held in an overcrowded cell in a high-security prison for almost six weeks pending trial on charges of inciting violence. On his release, Chin’ono was effectively banned from using social media for anything that could be seen as critical of the ruling Zanu-PF government. The arrest was part of a wide-ranging crackdown on dissent in Zimbabwe, during which between 50 and 100 opposition party officials, writers, labour activists and others arrested. Detainees included the award-winning author Tsitsi Dangarembga. The new arrest is thought to have been prompted by a tweet sent five days ago suggesting the chief justice of Zimbabwe, Luke Malaba, had intervened to deny Chin’ono bail. Malaba, who was appointed by the former ruler Robert Mugabe and is seen as a government loyalist, has been the centre of an intense row over judicial independence in Zimbabwe, with judges accusing him of systematic efforts to influence their decisions and restrict their autonomy. Earlier this year, Malaba was forced to withdraw a directive telling Zimbabwean judges that their judgments needed to be approved before being handed down. Judges last week complained in an open letter that many “are now so afraid of their own jobs that they consciously and subconsciously make decisions that they consider ‘safe’, even if these do not accord with the law”. The US embassy in Harare said the arrest of the respected documentary-maker was worrying. “Reports that authorities have again arrested @daddyhope for speaking out against corruption and defending fundamental freedoms raise serious concerns,” the embassy said on Twitter.
The US, UK, EU and others condemned the wave of repression in July. Local clergy also published a scathing open letter accusing the country’s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, and his government of an abuse of power. Images of political detainees being led to court in leg irons caused outrage. Chin’ono faces a lengthy prison sentence. The initial charges against him were based on a series of tweets he sent to encourage attendance at an opposition rally that was due to take place on 31 July. The authorities banned the protest, citing Covid-19 regulations, and deployed the army and riot police to disperse any demonstrators. Chin’ono was eventually freed on stringent bail conditions in September. He then gave a series of media interviews in which he described horrific conditions in prison. Mnangagwa came to power in 2017 following the military-led ousting of Robert Mugabe, whose dictatorial rule lasted almost 40 years. A former spy chief known as the Crocodile, he promised political and economic reform leading to major investment from overseas.

1617,Boris and Keir lock non-combative horns on lockdown at PMQs | John Crace,11/4/20,"Maybe it was because most minds were concentrated on the results of the election taking place in the US. Or maybe it was that all the arguments had already been made when the prime minister had given his statement on the second national lockdown on Monday. Either way, this week’s prime minister’s questions felt curiously underpowered. Rather as if Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson were going through the motions, with both taking it as read that it would be yet another easy points win for the Labour leader. Still, no politician has ever let repetition be a hindrance to what they are saying, regardless of whether they are right or wrong. So after inviting Johnson to agree that it wasn’t for any candidate in the US election to declare which votes counted and which didn’t – like all good populists, Boris believes you can have too much democracy, so he predictably declined to answer – Starmer moved on to the business of the lockdown. What had taken the government so long with this particular U-turn? After all, it had been two weeks since the PM had introduced a three-tiered regional system. Boris ummed and ahhed and tugged at his hair, aware that his more coiffed appearance on Monday had widely been seen as a sign of weakness, and proceeded to talk nonsense. He had been absolutely right to introduce regional lockdowns and they had been working brilliantly up until the moment he suddenly realised they weren’t working after all and that the infection rate was increasing across the country. Perhaps Starmer was as confused as everyone else by that logic or just wasn’t in the mood for gloating. Winning an argument against Boris has become too easy. All you do is argue the opposite of what he says he will do and you’ll be proved right with a government climbdown in next to no time. So rather than making a big deal of Johnson’s clear failure of leadership and that the Tories were now adopting Labour policy, Starmer kept to some simple facts. If the government had implemented the two to three-week “circuit breaker” lockdown over half-term as Sage and he had recommended, there would have been fewer deaths and less damage to the economy. Simples. So what was the plan if the R value wasn’t below 1 by 2 December? Here Boris struggled rather. While he could be sure that the lockdown regulations that parliament would be voting on later that afternoon would end on 2 December, he had no idea what might replace them if they had been insufficient in bringing down the rate of infection. Even he seems to have given up on Typhoid Dido’s test-and-trace system improving enough to bail him out, so all he could say was that he very much hoped the lockdown would work and it was political point-scoring to suggest it wouldn’t. Which was slightly ungracious as it had been Starmer’s promise to vote for the government measures that would ensure they became law. But then Boris has never been noted for either his loyalty or gratitude. He ended by incongruously saying Keir ought to be more like Tony Blair, who had written a piece in the Daily Mail about lockdowns, test and trace and vaccines that could as easily have been written by the current Labour leader. No wonder Starmer looked startled. He had spent most of the last week fending off the Labour left who felt he was already far too much like Blair. Seconds out, round three. Soon the two party leaders were slugging it out again for the debate on the new lockdown measures. Unsurprisingly, both Johnson and Starmer appeared even less enthusiastic or combative than they had earlier. Boris spent most of his time trying to dampen the concerns of the libertarians in his own party who were threatening to vote against him, rather than take pot shots at Labour, while Starmer delivered his stock speech on auto-pilot. It was all very under-powered. Things picked up a bit when Theresa May was called as Johnson seemed to make a point of walking out the chamber the moment she started talking. There is little love lost between the two and May began by saying how she would be unable to vote with the government. She must have enjoyed that. Having been serially betrayed by Boris over the years, it was good to even things up – if only a little. As so often, what was missing among the lockdown refuseniks was any sense of what they might vote for. How many Covid deaths a day were they prepared to accept to protect the economy? What alternatives to circuit breakers did they suggest, given that infection rates in regions under lockdown almost invariably only seemed to go up? Still, not having the answers has always been the backbenchers’ main privilege. It was left to Matt Hancock to close the debate for the government. He too regretted the need for the lockdown restrictions and promised to think again about people’s right to play golf and tennis. He also hinted the government might back down on communal worship. No bad thing, as prayer is all we seem to have left. With Labour backing it, the motion passed easily with fewer than 40 Tory rebels. But few were in any doubt they’d all be back to debate the same thing in a month’s time.",,Politics,Guardian,4
1618,Boris Johnson refuses to comment on Trump's call to stop vote-counting,11/4/20,"Boris Johnson has sidestepped calls to comment on Donald Trump’s call to stop the counting of votes in the US election saying: “We don’t comment as the UK government on the democratic processes of our friends and allies.” He had been asked by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, at prime minister’s questions in the Commons whether he agreed that “it’s not for the candidate to say which votes do or don’t count or when to stop counting” in the US election. Earlier on Wednesday, the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had urged patience in waiting for the final outcome. Trump falsely claimed victory in the race for the presidency in the early hours of Wednesday morning, even as the election remained too close to call with millions of votes yet to be counted. He baselessly claimed “a very sad group of people is trying to disfranchise” his supporters and confirmed the worst fears of activists and analysts who predicted Trump would use spurious arguments to stop legitimate mail-in votes from being counted. Other senior UK Conservatives, including the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, have said it would be a disaster for the democratic cause worldwide if the election ends with accusations of fraud. Johnson is personally close to Trump, but will want to keep the UK government out of the controversy over the conduct of the vote and while it may be in Johnson’s personal interest to see Trump – an enthusiastic supporter of Brexit – re-elected, the Foreign Office’s long-term alignment on issues such as China, the Iran nuclear deal and the climate crisis leaves British diplomats more comfortable with a more predictable Biden presidency. Trump does not want to see the EU and the UK develop close trade or security relations after the UK’s Brexit’s transition period ends this December. Trump’s close UK supporter Nigel Farage backed Trump’s claims the election was being stolen but, when pressed to produce evidence, he was unable to do so, saying the evidence was “so new it has not yet come to light”. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, argued that in a “normal election” Labour would be more impartial but statements from the US president had put the country’s democracy “at stake”. The Labour foreign affairs spokesperson said: “We are in completely uncharted territory, and this is not like any election in my lifetime … The truth is Britain is not just a disinterested observer in this election. Everything is riding on the outcome of this election and I think that statement [on stopping vote counts] has proven why. That questions of democracy, people’s right to be heard and free and fair elections are absolutely at stake in this election. “America has, for a long time, stepped into the role as leader of the free world. And what America does matters, it sends reverberations around the world and so there is a huge amount riding on the outcome of this election.”",,Politics,Guardian,4

1620,Fears about economy under Covid lockdown helped Trump outperform polls,11/4/20,"Voters’ fears about the economic impact of coronavirus lockdowns appear to have helped Donald Trump outperform pollsters’ expectations and brought the US election down to a nail-biting finish. While ballots are still being counted, that performance probably shows the continued resonance of anti-lockdown rhetoric in an election where, especially for Trump voters, economic health came first. The still evolving election result also shows the difficulty of delivering a nuanced public health message when Covid-19 cases are surging in the US and scientists, public health professionals, journalists and even doctors are under assault from the president and his allies. “No one is saying let’s shut down the economy,” said social epidemiologist Natalia Linos, executive director of the Harvard University FXB Center for Health and Human Rights. However, multi-pronged messages about throttled economic reopenings, mask-wearing and social distancing are “complicated” to get across. “For people who haven’t had first-hand experience of the health impact of Covid it may seem unnecessary,” said Linos. Exit polls show economic concerns were top of mind for voters, even for voters who had not yet experienced personal hardship because of the pandemic. Both a CNN and a New York Times exit poll showed Trump voters’ main issue was the economy with the coronavirus pandemic in fourth place in the Times survey, behind crime and health policy. Racial inequality beat the coronavirus into second place as the deciding issue for Democratic voters. Broad-based shutdowns in March and April brought economic worries to places such as the rural upper midwest long before the virus was widespread there. Political scientist Kathy Cramer, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said this was certainly the case in Wisconsin, where an edge-of-your-seat finish is now playing out. “There is no doubt that, in general, people were experiencing economic effects more than the health effects of the pandemic,” especially in the spring and summer, said Cramer. Cramer is also author of the Politics of Resentment: Rural Consciousness in Wisconsin and the Rise of Scott Walker. In the waning days of the campaign, one of Trump’s primary lines of attack on his opponent Democrat Joe Biden, was that he would “lock down” the economy again, and make the US into a “prison state”. Meanwhile, Biden focused predominantly on a message of unity and of criticizing the president’s Covid-19 response. Early lockdowns used, “a bazooka rather than a BB gun”, to control the virus, said Dr Howard Markel, a pandemic historian and pediatrician at the University of Michigan school of public health. Michigan is another swing state still too close to call, and is among five Biden must perform well in to win. “There are places that got locked down, along with other high-risk places, that were locked down that may not have needed to be locked down that quickly.” The fact that public health professionals are no longer calling for broad-based lockdowns – including the White House coronavirus taskforce adviser Dr Deborah Birx – is not a message that seemed to reach some voters. “What’s not being said, maybe by Democrats, is, ‘Hey, American people, don’t believe this malarkey,’” said Markel. “But if the president keeps denigrating these people – like ‘fire Fauci’ – then half the people don’t believe they’re telling the truth,” Markel said, referring to a recent chant to oust the nation’s pre-eminent infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institutes for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The virus control measures might also have been seen as heavy-handed by many of Trump’s white voters, because the pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on racial and ethnic minorities, who supported Biden in larger numbers, and the fact that the virus did not reach many rural areas until much later in the pandemic. By June, a Washington Post-Ipsos poll found one in three black Americans knew someone who had died of Covid 19, compared with one in 10 white Americans. According to exit polls, Trump held a 15% advantage over Biden with white voters. By contrast, Biden focused on the administration’s missteps in the pandemic, and held a 34% advantage over Trump among Latinos, the group which has arguably suffered the worst economic and health effects of the pandemic. “In places like Wisconsin, that did shift a bit over time,” said Cramer. “Wisconsin is a place that has experienced an incredible surge in recent weeks.” But even the recent wave of infections, “has focused around the Green Bay [metro] area”, an urban area that helped push Biden to lead Trump in the state overall. Cramer said early data appears to show Trump’s support has actually increased in rural America, and in parts of the south and midwest such as Oklahoma, Mississippi, Arkansas and Iowa. “Part of it is economics,” she said. “Race is a big element here, but it’s all of that together,” said Cramer. “Standing up for small business and deregulation and white folks has reinforced, for many people, that he is their person.” This article was amended on 5 November 2020 to correct a misspelling of Natalia Linos’ name.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1621,Fighting reported in Ethiopia after PM responds to 'attack' by regional ruling party,11/4/20,"Fighting has been reported in northern Ethiopia after the country’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, ordered a military response to an “attack” by the ruling party of the restive Tigray region on a camp housing federal troops. Analysts and diplomats have been warning for weeks that a standoff between the federal government and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) could plunge Ethiopia into a bitter and bloody civil conflict. On Wednesday, Abiy accused the the TPLF of attacking a military camp in the region and attempting to loot military assets. “Our defence forces … have been ordered to carry out their mission to save the country,” he said. “The final point of the red line has been crossed. Force is being used as the last measure to save the people and the country.”
Addressing the nation on TV, the prime minister announced that “several martyrs” had died in the attack in Mekele, the northern Tigray region’s capital, and Dansha town. The government declared a six-month state of emergency in the Tigray region. The prime minister’s spokesman, Billene Seyoum, told Reuters later in the day that military operations in Tigray had commenced, and diplomats reported armed clashes but gave no further details. “This war is the worst possible outcome of the tensions that have been brewing. Given Tigray’s relatively strong security position, the conflict may well be protracted and disastrous,” said William Davison, International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Ethiopia. “It could seriously strain an Ethiopian state already buffeted by multiple grave political challenges, and could also send shockwaves into the Horn of Africa region and beyond.” The TPLF dominated Ethiopia’s governing coalition for decades before Abiy took office in 2018 and announced sweeping political reforms. Those reforms, however, have allowed old ethnic and other grievances to surface, and led to instability. Tigray’s population makes up 5% of Ethiopia’s 109 million people, but it is wealthier and more influential than many other, larger regions.
Under Abiy, who won last year’s Nobel peace prize for ending a war with neighbouring Eritrea, Tigrayan leaders have complained of being unfairly targeted in corruption prosecutions, removed from top positions and blamed for the country’s problems. One factor in the latest crisis is the postponement of national elections due to the Covid-19 pandemic. National polls were due to take place in August, but electoral officials ruled in March that all voting would be delayed until the threat from the virus had eased. When parliamentarians voted to extend officials’ mandates – which would have expired in early October – Tigrayan leaders went ahead with regional elections in September that Abiy’s government deemed illegal. Now each side sees the other as illegitimate, and federal lawmakers have ruled that Abiy’s government should cut off contact with – and funding to – Tigray’s leadership. The Tigray region is home to a large portion of federal military personnel and where much of its equipment is located, a legacy of Ethiopia’s brutal 1998-2000 border war with Eritrea, its northern neighbour. Some analysts estimate that Tigray could muster more than half of the armed forces’ total personnel and mechanised divisions. Last week, Tigray blocked a general appointed by Abiy from assuming a new posting, saying Abiy no longer had the authority to make such moves. Tigrayan officials have said in recent days they would not initiate a military conflict. However, the risk of war is high. On Tuesday night, hours before Abiy’s announcement, Wondimu Asamnew, another senior Tigrayan official, told AFP the federal government was amassing troops on the southern border of Tigray – a claim that could not be independently verified. “I think when it comes to military mobilisation, it’s not child’s play. It can trigger all-out war … what they are doing is playing with fire,” Wondimu said. “A small spark can ignite the whole region. So I think we are on the alert and I can assure you we are capable of defending ourselves.” Nic Cheeseman, an expert in African politics at Brimingham university, said that as much of the country’s military capacity had been under the control of the TPLF, an open confrontation would not necessity result in a straightforward “win” for Ethiopian forces. “There is also a real risk that open conflict will exacerbate ethnic tensions and inspire further secessionist sentiment in other parts of this country. If so, Ethiopia could come apart at the seams. ,” Cheeseman said. Observers have called for a ceasefire and unconditional discussions in a neutral location in order to sustain a truce and address the grievances of both sides. However, rhetoric in recent weeks has been highly charged and regional dynamics – such as the growing closeness of leaders in Addis Ababa and Eritrea – will need to be considered in any solution, analysts said. Ahmed Soliman, at Chatham House in London, said the consequences of a full-blown conflict would be “unspeakable” for Ethiopia and east Africa. “Ethiopia has been experiencing a difficult transition over recent years but remains the diplomatic cornerstone of the region,” he said. The vast country, the second most populous in Africa, has long been a strategic partner of Washington. US diplomats in Addis Ababa called for “an immediate de-escalation of the current situation in Tigray and a measured response by both sides”.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1622,France considers envoy to explain Macron's ideas to Muslim states,11/4/20,"France is looking at appointing a special envoy to explain Emmanuel Macron’s thinking on secularism and freedom of expression in a bid to quell the anti-French backlash growing in some Muslim countries, officials have said. The growth in anti-French sentiment also has the potential to deepen the already entrenched conflict between Macron and Turkey over Libya and oil exploration in the eastern Mediterranean. Macron has already conducted one lengthy interview on Al Jazeera Arabic seeking to justify his approach, but has so far only received full-throated support for his stance from the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, Anwar Gargash. Macron also spoke on the phone to the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, to reassure him that he distinguished between terrorism and extremism on the one hand, and Islam and Islamic thinking on the other. Many Arab leaders have condemned the killing of the French teacher Samuel Paty on 16 October, the subsequent killings in Nice and the latest murders on Monday night in Vienna, but the degree of explicit and implicit criticism of Macron’s stance on freedom of expression has startled some French officials. There was also concern that some mainstream news agencies in Turkey and Qatar have carried opinion pieces claiming that the rights of Muslims in France have been suppressed. Macron has been personally caricatured in the Iranian press as the devil and his effigy burned in Bangladesh as 50,000 protesters took to the streets. A call to boycott French products, encouraged by Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has also been launched with little effect. The Saudi foreign ministry said it “rejects any attempt to link Islam with terrorism, and condemns the offensive cartoons of the prophet” . Its government also called for “intellectual and cultural freedom to be a beacon of respect, tolerance and peace that rejects practices and acts which generate hatred, violence and extremism and are contrary to the values of coexistence”. The former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad wrote on Twitter that “Muslims have a right to be angry and to kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past. But by and large the Muslims have not applied the ‘eye for an eye’ law. Muslims don’t. The French shouldn’t. Instead the French should teach their people to respect other people’s feelings.” The attitude of the French president was, he said, “very primitive”. Gargash, an ally of the French and opponent of Turkey in Libya, said in an interview with Die Welt: “[Muslims] have to listen carefully to what Macron said in his speech. He doesn’t want to ghettoise Muslims in the west, and he is totally right.” He added: “As a Muslim, I feel offended by certain caricatures. But as a thinking person, I see the politics that are carried out around this topic. With his attacks on France, Erdoğan manipulates a religious issue for political purposes. “The words of the French president were deliberately taken out of context.” Gargash said Erdoğan was using the controversy to mount a political recovery. “As soon as Erdoğan sees a loophole or weakness, he uses it to increase his influence. It is only when he is shown the red line that he is ready to negotiate,” he said. “Erdoğan wants to become the leader of Sunni Islam. That’s why he stages it that way. But in truth this is a political project, not a theological one.” He said the real goal of the Turkish president was to expand the influence of his country in the Muslim world, which already extends from the Gulf to the western Mediterranean. “Erdoğan wants to use this situation and rebuild the Ottoman empire. Like Iran, it pursues an imperialist policy, and that is one of the main dangers in the region,” he said. “Macron is one of the few European politicians who openly oppose Turkey’s regional expansion,” says Gargash. “Europe needs a united stance towards Turkey”. Macron has stressed the cartoons were not official publications. He said: “I understand and respect that we can be shocked by these cartoons, but I will never accept that we can justify physical violence for these cartoons. I will always defend in my country the freedom to say, write, think, draw.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1623,Gloom descends on England as nation prepares for second lockdown,11/4/20,"Much has been made of how Covid has deepened divisions in Britain: between the haves and the have-nots, the work-from-homers and the have-to-go-to-workers, the doves and the hawks, England’s north and south. But as England approaches its second national lockdown on Thursday, a communal feeling unites the nation: gloom. If a sound could sum up the country’s mood it would be a long, drawn-out sigh. Give it a few more weeks and it could become a Munchian scream. Working in the Humbugs sweet shop in Chippenham in Wiltshire, Rita Sargant summed up the prospect of a month at home succinctly. “Rubbish,” she said. “Life’s for living. I’m 89 and if I get Covid, get me a bottle of whisky and a box of chocolates and leave me.” Whereas the panic-buying first time around was focused on toilet rolls and tinned tomatoes, this time people are stockpiling for comfort, she said. “People love their sweets. They’ve been coming in to stock up.” In the supermarkets, yeast and bread flour – the “It” ingredients of the first wave – remain in plentiful supply, suggesting England is now happier on the sofa watching Bake Off instead of baking their own bread. Asked what she would do during lockdown, Sargant replied: “God knows, I’ll go mad. Last time, I spent a lot of time in the garden, but I can’t do that this time because of the weather. I’ll walk three or four miles a day to keep me going.” Millions of people kept fit with Joe Wicks during lockdown part one, but even the Body Coach himself cannot face daily workouts this time. The 34-year-old said he was going to share three new workouts a week until the latest lockdown is over, “however long that takes”. Talking to Radio 4’s You And Yours on Tuesday, Wicks admitted it was hard to get motivated to exercise during winter “when it’s dark and grim and wet”. Gyms are supposed to close on Thursday, but several insist they will defy the law and stay open. The owners of Gainz, a 24-hour gym in Bedford, posted a statement on Instagram explaining their reasoning. “We witnessed a breakdown in people’s mental health during the first lockdown and this isn’t something anybody wants to repeat,” they wrote. Bedfordshire police said it was aware of the post and said that as the legislation is not yet in force, the council was leading on the matter.
A beauty salon in Liverpool also said it would not shut up shop, vowing to fight the lockdown in court. Skin Kerr in Bootle has already been shut down once for displaying posters saying: “You can’t catch what doesn’t exist”, as well as banning masks and “Covid talk”. However, overall, the prevailing mood is one of weary resignation rather than defiance. Back in Chippenham on Tuesday, the town was bustling. Some people were buying Christmas presents and wrapping paper, others taking advantage of pre-lockdown offers. One of the charity shops was offering everything at half price. Barbers, hairdressers, tattoo parlours, pubs were doing a brisk trade. Chippenham is in a tier 1 area, meaning the pubs have been able to stay open until now. Lorna Noble, 28, the landlady of the Black Horse, was pessimistic about the weeks ahead. “It’s really hard times for us. It’s one thing after another. We had the first lockdown, then the 10pm curfew, which was a big blow for us, now lockdown again.” She has had to let half her staff go. “We’re not sure what the future holds.” In Greater Manchester, the pubs have been shut for almost two weeks already under tier 3 measures – at least those who weren’t able to force clients to order a “substantial meal” with every pint. But the region, along with much of Lancashire and West Yorkshire, has in effect been in tier 2 since 31 July. All household mixing has been banned indoors, causing a slump in trade as the weather has turned. In Old Trafford, Rosalyn Wilde, a construction bid manager, said little would change for her on Thursday. “For us having been in lockdown for a long time, it doesn’t really feel that different, and I am happy to grin and bear it for a few weeks if it means we have any chance of seeing family at Christmas. I do feel that if it drags on longer than the four weeks though that people will start ignoring the advice,” she said. She thinks the country should already be in a national lockdown and that government rhetoric is not helping the widening gap between the north and south. “The thing that annoyed me when the talks were ongoing in Greater Manchester about going into tier 3 was the constant commentary about how the rate in some parts of the country was low, so a national lockdown wouldn’t be ‘fair’. “My two responses to that were that first, the rate in pretty much every part of the country was higher than it was in Trafford when we were put under local lockdown, and second, there was a national lockdown in March when Covid was mainly prevalent in the south with few cases ‘up north’, but none of us up here blamed those ‘down south’.” She is still cross after a government minister only a few weeks ago justified local lockdowns by saying the rate in Cornwall was low. “I checked, and it was pretty much the same as the rate here when we were put under restrictions – that really wound me up,” she said.
In the Stockport suburb of Romiley, Shaun Rowark, a senior healthcare analyst, resented the implication that the national lockdown was only happening now because the north couldn’t get its house in order. In the House of Commons on Monday, Boris Johnson repeatedly thanked the residents of various Tory constituencies in tier 1 for working hard to keep disease levels low, while apologising for putting them under lockdown. “I would like to know what evidence he has that their behaviour has been better than ours,” said Rowark. “Greater Manchester has one of the biggest student populations in the country and that’s where [many] of the infections have been – it’s not because tier 3 residents are not behaving.” Romiley is in the Conservative-held constituency of Hazel Grove, but many locals are starting to despair at the government’s approach. Johnson’s remarks were “condescending”, tutted Pat Willetts, a grandmother. ‘“Instead of congratulating parts of the country, he should be focusing on making the rules simpler so that everyone understands what they need to do,” she said. “Too much has been focused on the financial costs of lockdown rather than public health and safety, and we should have been in a national lockdown much earlier than this.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1624,GPs in England told to be ready to administer Covid vaccine by Christmas,11/4/20,"The NHS is preparing to administer any potential coronavirus vaccine before Christmas, as it was revealed that the number of Covid in-patients in England was equivalent to 22 hospitals full of patients. Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said there had been a “very substantial” increase in coronavirus hospital admissions in October. Projections by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) show that, by the end of November, there will be more Covid in-patients than there were during the first peak in April. But there was some hope as Stevens disclosed the health service was preparing to write to all GPs across the country in anticipation of a potential vaccine being available before Christmas. GPs will be “geared up to start by Christmas if the vaccine becomes available”, Stevens said. He added: “There are over 200 vaccines in development and we believe that we should hopefully get one or more of those available from the first part of next year. “In anticipation of that we’re also gearing the NHS up to be ready to make a start on administering Covid vaccines before Christmas, if they become available. “We reached an agreement with GPs to ensure they will be doing that, and we’ll be writing to GP practices this week to get them geared up to start by Christmas if the vaccine becomes available.”
Stevens said the health service was “adding as much capacity as it can” in anticipation of the usual winter pressures and greater demand due to the pandemic. “In many parts of the country we’re now seeing more coronavirus in-patients in hospital and in intensive care than we saw in the first peak in April,” he said. In early September, there were under 500 coronavirus patients in hospitals, he said. By the beginning of October that figure had risen to 2,000. The current figure is just under 11,000 in-patients. “So, put another way, we’ve got 22 hospitals’ worth of coronavirus patients across England. And indeed, even since Saturday, when the prime minister gave his press conference, we filled another two hospitals full of severely ill coronavirus patients,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
Stevens urged the public to adhere to national lockdown restrictions to preserve other services as he revealed that a quarter of routine operations had been cancelled in the north-west. “And the reason we want to try and minimise the number of coronavirus infections and patients is not only because of the excess death rate that implies, but because of the knock-on consequences it has for other services: routine operations, cancer care,” he said. He added: “So if we want to preserve those other services so that the health service can continue to help the full range of patients, we need to do everything we can, together, to keep the infection rate down for coronavirus.” A further 397 people were reported on Tuesday as having died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, the highest daily increase in Covid-related deaths in five months. While the Tuesday tally tends to be higher owing to a delay in reporting deaths over the weekend, the latest figure is nevertheless the highest recorded since 422 people were reported as having died on 27 May. It is more than seven times the daily toll recorded on 23 March when the first national lockdown began, and takes the government’s official coronavirus death toll for the UK since the pandemic began to 47,250. However, separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies for deaths, where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate, together with additional data on deaths that have occurred in recent days, show there have now been just under 63,000 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK.
Stevens also suggested that all patient-facing NHS staff would soon be routinely tested, regardless of symptoms. He said: “Routine testing of asymptomatic NHS staff has now begun in high prevalence parts of the country, areas where there are outbreaks, and more than 70,000 NHS staff have had those tests within the last several weeks. “And the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, yesterday wrote to the health committee, to parliament, explaining that, because the availability of testing had now increased, and we’ve got this new saliva testing that will be available for hospital and other health service staff over the next six or eight weeks, we will now be able to press on routinely testing all patient-facing NHS staff.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1625,Indian TV anchor's arrest escalates feud with Maharashtra state,11/4/20,"One of India’s most famous and polarising television journalists has been arrested in connection with a 2018 suicide case, escalating an ongoing feud between the conservative news anchor and the Maharashtra state government. Arnab Goswami, the founder of the rightwing channel Republic TV, was arrested at his home in Mumbai early on Wednesday. It prompted a chorus of anger from the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), including from the home affairs minister, Amit Shah, who called it a “blatant misuse of state power”. Goswami has made a name for himself as one of the India’s most aggressive and pro-government TV news hosts. On Republic TV, he is regularly seen shouting and pointing into the camera as he vehemently champions the Hindu nationalist cause of the BJP and the prime minister, Narendra Modi. Republic TV has been accused of smearing opponents and fuelling anti-Muslim conspiracy theories. It is under investigation for allegedly rigging its viewer ratings by paying people to leave their televisions constantly running its channel. Republic TV and Goswami have strongly denied the allegations.
Most recently, Goswami had antagonised the Maharashtra state government, controlled by the Shiv Sena party, by accusing it of involvement in the death of the Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, who killed himself in June. Shiv Sena is a former ally of the BJP, but the two parties are now bitter rivals. Goswami was accused of exploiting Rajput’s death in order to smear the BJP’s political rival in Maharashtra, as were other BJP supporters who pushed the narrative that Rajput was murdered, which has been proved unfounded. Leading figures from the BJP accused the Maharashtra government of taking “revenge” on Goswami by arresting him in connection with the 2018 suicide of an interior designer, Anvay Naik. In a note, Naik allegedly blamed Goswami for driving him to his death by refusing to pay him for work he had done for Republic TV. In a statement in 2018, Republic TV said the allegations were unfounded.
Under the previous BJP government administration in Maharashtra, the Naik case had been closed, allegedly after political pressure was applied, but Mumbai police said it had now been reopened. The BJP president, JP Nadda, called Goswami’s arrest an “assault on press freedom” while the former BJP Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said “such attempts to suppress a voice against the government is detrimental to democracy”. However, many have accused the BJP of hypocrisy, pointing out that many journalists and publications that publish pieces critical of the BJP government are regularly named as “anti-nationals” and arrested or charged under criminal law. During the Covid-19 crisis, more that 50 journalists have been arrested for critical coverage. In a recent report by Reporters without Borders, India fell to 142nd out of 180 countries in the global press freedom index. Shiv Sena denied any involvement in Goswami’s arrest. “The state government or any political party has nothing to do with the arrest,” said Anil Parab, a Shiv Sena spokesperson. “There is no politics of revenge. The BJP is trying to save Arnab Goswami as if their party worker has been taken away by the police.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1626,Johnson refuses to rule out Covid lockdown extension for England,11/4/20,"Boris Johnson has refused to rule out an extended national lockdown for England if the scheduled four weeks of restrictions fail to rein in coronavirus infections, telling MPs only that it was his “hope” to reopen the economy before Christmas. In a mixed message before an afternoon Commons vote on the lockdown, which is due to start on Thursday, the prime minister had earlier told the CBI conference that the restrictions would definitely end in four weeks.
In a video message to the event, produced after the prime minister pulled out of a scheduled speech on Monday, he told CBI delegates: “Believe me, we will end these autumn measures on 2 December when they expire.” But under pressure from Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Johnson would say only that the lockdown rules would expire on 2 December, which they will do under law. He declined twice to fully engage with questions from the Labour leader about whether the government could then propose an extension to national restrictions if the R rate was still above 1, meaning the number of Covid cases was still rising. “Will the lockdown end on 2 December, come what may, or will it depend on circumstances at the time? People need to know that,” Starmer asked. Johnson responded: “These autumn measures to combat the surge will expire automatically on 2 December, and we will then, I hope very much, be able to get this country going again, to get businesses, to get shops going again in the run-up to Christmas.
“But that depends on us all doing our bit now to make sure that we get the R down. I have no doubt that we can.” Starmer pressed the PM with his next question, asking specifically if lockdown would end if the R rate remained above 1 on 2 December, with Johnson avoiding the question. The Labour leader expressed exasperation, saying: “I just want some basic honesty. This is serious – we’ve got to look the public in the eye.” Earlier in the Commons exchanges, Starmer had asked Johnson to justify his delay in imposing a national lockdown, saying that on 21 September, when government scientists advised a “circuit breaker” period to reduce infection rates, the daily Covid death toll had been 11. “On Monday, 42 days later, the number of people who tragically lost their lives to Covid-19 was 397 – that’s a staggering 35-fold increase,” Starmer said. “Does the prime minister understand the human cost of his delay in acting?” In an answer seemingly aimed as much to the Conservative rebels who plan to vote against the lockdown, Johnson said there had been no choice but to change course, while insisting it had been right to first try a system of tiered regional restrictions. “It is precisely because we understand the economic cost, and it is precisely because we understand the social, the psychological damage of lockdown, that it was right to go for the local and the regional solutions,” he said. Starmer urged the PM to use the lockdown to improve the performance of the test-and-trace system, saying it was not reaching enough contacts, and that too many people were not self-isolating when told to. Johnson praised the performance of the system overall, but added: “I am perfectly willing to accept the failings of NHS test and trace, of course I am. And of course I take full responsibility for the frustrations people have experienced with that system.” At the CBI conference, Johnson said he knew many companies had taken major steps to comply with restrictions. “I want to thank you for the heroic efforts you’ve made to look after your employees, to make your premises Covid-secure, putting in Perspex screens, all the trouble you’ve gone to in complying with the kinds of diktats that I never believed we would have to impose, which, I assure you, go completely against every free market instinct I possess.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1627,Jordan suffers Covid surge after early success against virus,11/4/20,"Rates of new Covid-19 cases in Jordan have risen to among the highest in the world a few months after the kingdom appeared to have eliminated community transmission of the virus and relaxed most public health restrictions. As recently as three months ago, Jordan was counted alongside New Zealand, Thailand and Vietnam as a coronavirus success story, after going weeks without detecting infections in the community and registering just over 1,100 cases and 11 deaths as of late July. On Monday this week the country of 10 million people announced it had detected a daily record 5,877 cases – one of the highest per capita rates in the world – with more than 80,000 detected overall. Nearly 970 people have died. “I believe that we are now witnessing the first wave – what we dealt with in the beginning was cluster cases,” said Ismail Matalka, the former dean of the school of medicine at Jordan University of Science and Technology. Jordan’s early success was credited to swift, strict action, with authorities sealing off borders in mid-March and briefly placing citizens under one of the most restrictive lockdowns in the world – banning anyone from leaving the house for any reason but a medical emergency, punishable by up to one year in prison. The measures were seen as necessary to compensate for a healthcare system the World Health Organization rated as one of the least prepared in the region to fight the virus. The then prime minister, Omar Razzaz, said in July that the country had effectively eliminated community cases but that it was a question of “when, not if” another wave would hit. Cases started to grow again even before the country reopened its borders to commercial flights in September, thought to be fuelled by truck drivers bringing goods from neighbouring Syria and Saudi Arabia, countries where the outbreak has been much larger.
Authorities have tightened an evening curfew and reimposed lockdowns on Fridays – the first day of the weekend in the country, when many people would pray together in mosques and visit each other’s homes – but said the economy could not afford the same harsh measures that stamped out the virus between March and May. Health experts in the country said the resurgent pandemic illustrated the limits of lockdowns and closed borders without a strong testing and contact-tracing system, especially when dealing with a lengthy pandemic.
“We went into full lockdown betting that the world would find a cure or a vaccine, as was the situation with other global pandemics, but that did not work,” said Khaled Rababah, the head of the nurses’ union. “It is clear that we cannot isolate ourselves in a global pandemic,” Matalka said. “This simply cannot work as a main strategy since no country can sustain this for a long time.” The country’s health ministry says PCR tests are returning positive rates between 17% and 23%. “But I estimate there is wider community spread and even higher positive rates, since these tests are still targeted,” Matalka said.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1628,Love in the time of Covid – from weddings to help for rough sleepers,11/4/20,"As the country heads into a winter of tough coronavirus restrictions, once again communities are coming together to help those in need and provide some much-needed joy in these challenging times. Last wedding before lockdown A man who flew to Sydney to declare his love has married in a last-minute ceremony before lockdown. The Rev Richard Coles tweeted a picture of the happy couple, Eric and Lizzie, and the story of how they came to be together. Coles said Eric came to him for advice after realising he loved Lizzie, who had just emigrated to Australia. â€œYou know what to do,â€� Coles replied, and after flying to Sydney to explain his feelings, the couple were united.
Shrewsbury hotel reopens its doors to rough sleepers A Tudor hotel in Shrewsbury is reopening its doors to rough sleepers, after hosting 57 people during the first lockdown. Mike Matthews, manager of Prince Rupert hotel, said the cold weather during this lockdown means finding accommodation for homeless people is crucial and heâ€™s urging other hotels to follow his example. â€œItâ€™s going to be harsh weather as we enter the winter, and hotels galore have empty bedrooms. Thereâ€™s no logical reason for hotels not to offer their services,â€� he said. Working closely with Shropshire council, Matthews said 14 people were moving into the 70-room hotel on Wednesday, and would have use of the hotel for as long as needed over the winter. Of those who stayed in the hotel during the first lockdown, nine are still living there and one is now employed full-time in the hotel, while two-thirds moved into permanent homes. â€œWeâ€™ve built up a strong bond with them, theyâ€™re part of the Prince Rupert family now,â€� said Matthews, who moved into the hotel full-time along with two colleagues to support the arrivals. â€œIt has been challenging and highly complex at times but ultimately our focus is to help them through a difficult period in their lives, and hopefully they come out of it in a much better place.â€� Homelessness charities have urged the government to bring back the â€œEveryone Inâ€� scheme that provided emergency accommodation in hotels during the first lockdown. Schools to hold monthly birthday parties for children who miss out due to Covid A primary school in Walsall has announced it will hold monthly birthday parties for students who canâ€™t celebrate their special days as normal because of coronavirus restrictions. In a letter to parents, Goldsmith primary academy said: â€œWe understand our children have already had so many challenges and had to adapt to new rules and regulations both at home and school, and their emotional wellbeing is something that is very important to us.â€� The headteacher, Leanne Bridgwood, told BBC West Midlands: â€œWeâ€™ve been thinking about what we can give back and what children are missing out on and we realised there is a loophole in government guidance where we can provide a party for children even if their parents at home canâ€™t.â€� The parties will take place on the last Friday of each month, with games, snacks, banners and badges, and each child who had a birthday that month will receive a cake.
â€œThe staff are as keen to start the parties as the children,â€� said Bridgwood. â€œItâ€™s a time where can forget about Covid, and English and maths, for an hour and really enjoy ourselves. The other day, one child wrote: â€˜Thank you for giving our birthday parties backâ€™.â€� 104-year-old completes marathon walk for charity A 104-year-old great-grandmother has completed a marathon walk for charity.

She extended her challenge to the length of a marathon and crossed the finish line of her 26.2-mile (42km) walk at Newbury Racecourse on Wednesday.

1629,"Netherlands introduces car-free Sundays - archive, 1973",11/4/20,"Holland saddle-sore but fume free Richard Norton-Taylor, Amsterdam 5 November 1973 The Dutch proved today that they could be as phlegmatic as the British ever were. As the government’s ban on Sunday driving came into force, motorways were abandoned, and queues at bus stops were long. Empty taxis were parked in rows at the ranks. The Government’s initiative was widely welcomed, and it is not difficult to see why. At the busy crossroads where yesterday I waited an hour for a breakdown van to come and mend my car, the sound of bicycle bells and rusty – and not so rusty – wheels purring almost delicately took the place of angry drivers blowing their horns and impatiently revving their engines.
There were, of course, authorised exceptions to the ban apart from public transport; fire engines, ambulances, doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons, foreign tourists, and tradesmen who had to get their food to markets, restaurants and hotels. But in Amsterdam, still western Europe’s leading centre for hippies, it was entirely appropriate that the police in the best of faith allowed the bearded long-haired driver to take a group of foreign hippies on a tour of the city in his psychedelic bus. “It’s very nice, after all,” said the long-haired police corporal with his limited English. The Dutch are also thrifty and by this evening only a dozen motorists In Amsterdam and a handful in The Hague had been fined for breaking the regulations. Television crews from Germany, Belgium, and Sweden were busy taking shots of middle-aged couples sharing a single bicycle taken from the back of the garage.
A cabaret group leader was less fortunate; he could take his equipment to another town for a show tonight, but the rest of his group had to go by public transport. A French couple who had hired a car with local number plates also expressed dismay when they were told that they had to walk – or use public transport. But the police enjoyed recounting how they stopped a car at three this morning (when the ban came into force); the car drove off at speed, the police took to the chase and finally caught two Yugoslavs who had chosen just the wrong hour to steal a vehicle. Under the emergency 1939 Distribution Law, which the government has reenacted, those who break the ban on driving can face fines of up to £17,500 or a maximum prison sentence of six years. However, police today were fining those few culprits they saw about £17. Some Dutchmen were looking ahead to the heart of winter and potential cuts on domestic fuel consumption. They blamed the government for “provoking” the Arab oil producers into their boycott of the Netherlands by its reputedly pro-Israeli stand.
This is a land of countless cyclists – they enjoy priority on the roads and at junctions over cars. In addition there are an estimated six million mopeds as against three million cars. Yet as the standard of living rises, so car-driving is becoming a sport as in all other west European countries. Perhaps the success of the government’s initiative today can be put down partly to what one Dutchman referred to as “the element of Calvinism” that still has a place somewhere in the souls of his countrymen. And those churchmen who still scorn any activity on the Sabbath could thank the Arabs for helping them in their task.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1630,NZ website withdraws author's works after she criticises Māori foreign minister,11/4/20,"A major New Zealand website has pulled the books of a local author after she made comments about the countryâ€™s incoming foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, that many considered offensive. Mahuta is the first woman to be appointed to the role of foreign minister and the second-ever MÄ�ori person. In 2016 Mahuta became the first MÄ�ori woman to display a moko kauae [sacred facial tattoo] in parliament and has been promoted from associate minister of housing and MÄ�ori affairs to one of the highest ministerial portfolios. On Monday writer Olivia Pierson publicly criticised Mahuta, making comments about her moko and suggesting it was inappropriate for a diplomat.
â€œMoko is a statement of identity, like a passport,â€� Mahuta, from the Waikato-Maniapoto tribe, told the Guardian in 2016. â€œI am at a time in my life where I am ready to make a clear statement that this is who I am, and this is my position in New Zealand.â€� Mahuta had the moko kauae inked in 2016, alongside 13 other prominent MÄ�ori women. They are usually bestowed on high-ranking MÄ�ori women as a reflection of their standing and mana, or power, in the community. Marama Fox, co-leader of the Maori party, told the Guardian in 2016: â€œApart from the fact that I find her moko kauae stunningly beautiful, it is an expression of her whakapapa [genealogy] and uniqueness. â€œIâ€™m proud as a MÄ�ori woman to sit alongside her in parliament restoring to our political landscape a symbolic gesture of rangatiratanga [self-determination] previously dissuaded during our colonial struggle to give vote to MÄ�ori women in their land of inheritance.â€� On Twitter Pierson wrote: â€œFacial tattoos, especially on a female diplomat, is the height of ugly, uncivilised wokedom!â€�.
On her website, Pierson describes herself as a â€œfree-thought advocateâ€�. Her most recent book is Western Values Defended: A Primer. The Guardian has approached Pierson for comment. Piersonâ€™s comments were quickly censured, with many New Zealand twitter users encouraging her to delete her original post. The New Zealand-run general goods website Mighty Ape also took swift action and said it would stop selling Piersonâ€™s books immediately, bringing applause from many. Mighty Ape was contacted for comment. Piersonâ€™s supporters say she has become a victim of â€œextreme wokenessâ€�, and the move by Mighty Ape was an example of â€œcancel cultureâ€� in action.
Mahuta, who has been an MP for more than 20 years, has previously said she wanted to break down the negative associations that facial moko have with gang membership in New Zealand. â€œI think there is an emerging awareness about the revitalisation of MÄ�ori culture and that facial moko is a positive aspect of that.

1631,Only 'small chance' Oxford Covid vaccine ready by Christmas,11/4/20,"The head of the Oxford University group developing one of the leading Covid vaccine contenders has played down the chances of vaccinating people by Christmas. “I think there is a small chance of that being possible, but I just don’t know,’’ said Prof Andrew Pollard, the chief investigator of the trial, giving evidence to MPs at a joint hearing of the science and health committees of the House of Commons. Pollard said it was very difficult to answer the question. The Oxford team, working with pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca, has not yet looked at any results to find out whether it works and will protect people against the virus or prevent them becoming seriously ill. “I’m optimistic that we could reach that point before the end of this year to do an analysis,” he said. But then they would need to put their data to the regulatory authorities. “We absolutely need that to happen so there’s very careful scrutiny of everything that’s been done in the clinical trials, to look at their integrity and the quality of the data and to verify that the results are correct,” he said. After that would come the policy decisions about who would get the vaccine and how it would be deployed.
It was possible other vaccines might be approved before the Oxford one, he said, and he hoped there would be lots of successes because multiple vaccines would be needed for the 7 billion people in the world. Kate Bingham, the head of the UK vaccines taskforce, told the committee “we could be weeks away” from looking at the interim data for both the Oxford/AstraZeneca and the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines, for which the UK has also agreed a deal. Manufacturing of the vaccines was well advanced, she said, although she would not disclose how many doses of the Oxford vaccine had already been made. They were scaling up at unprecedented speed, “starting with low numbers of doses – by which I do mean millions of doses, but not tens of millions of doses initially – so that we will end up with 100 million doses that we’ve secured from AZ in the first half of next year”.
Other questions will arise once results are known, Pollard said. The US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, has said it wanted at least 50% efficacy to approve a vaccine, but if one was found to prevent 40% of cases, policymakers would have to consider whether it would be of help to the NHS.
A good result would be having vaccines with significant efficacy, he said, “whether that’s 50, 60, 70, 80, or whatever the figure is, that is an enormous achievement, it means that there are, from a health system point of view, fewer people with Covid going into hospital. People who develop cancer can have their operations and all their chemotherapy”. But that would not mean an immediate end to the pandemic. “It is a complete game changer and a success if we meet those efficacy end points, but unfortunately, it doesn’t mean that we can all go back to normal immediately. It takes time to roll out vaccines and not everyone will take them. And we will still have people getting this virus because it’s just too good at transmitting,” he said.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1632,PNG police chief raises fears officers may have been raping women inside station,11/4/20,"Two policemen have been charged with rape allegedly committed inside a police station in Alotau Town, in Papua New Guinea’s south-east, but the city’s most senior officer said he fears others sexual assaults may have been committed by police, with victims too afraid to report attacks. “I can honestly say that this practice may have been going on for a while,” Milne Bay provincial police commander Peter Barkie told the Guardian. “I’ve heard about it but since taking office I can only confirm two [alleged] cases, who were charged during my time.”
Barkie said rapes and sexual assaults were almost never reported to police, with victims deterred by cultural and social stigma and an abiding mistrust of the police. “One of the main reasons is because these female detainees were ashamed and many were married women who wanted to protect their marriages, [so] none of them came forward. “That is another reason why none of the women came forward, though there were whispers, I believe they were afraid to come out and lay an official complaint because at that time, people were afraid of the police.” One assault survivor, who wished to remain anonymous, was detained at the police station for allegedly committing adultery – a crime under PNG law. The woman was allegedly raped by a policeman earlier this year. Two officers have been charged over the alleged assault. Robert Ali, the director of PNG police’s internal investigation unit at that time of the alleged assault in March, said he was aware of the report of the alleged incident and confirmed the two officers’ cases were before the courts. The case has not yet gone to trial, delayed by Covid-19, and the officers have not yet entered pleas. Ali said that he could not confirm or deny other alleged instances inside the police station were under investigation. A Milne Bay resident who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said she believed assaults had been occurring for years and that perpetrators escaped prosecution because rape was seen as a taboo topic in conservative, deeply religious, PNG society. “No woman would come forward and say she was raped, because sadly, society would look at her differently, they would blame her and even, sometimes, this destroys their marriages, and husbands instead of supporting their wives to seek justice, divorce them out of shame that she was raped.” “A couple of us have tried to get this out, we’ve helped to lay complaints at the Alotau police station and when there was no response, we sent a report down to the police headquarters in Port Moresby, and also sent a report to the police internal investigation unit… but most times, nothing comes out of it,” the source said. Unrelated to alleged offences in Alotau Town, PNG’s reformist police minister Bryan Kramer made an extraordinary condemnation of his own force last month, alleging the police force was the most corrupt public agency in the country, engaged in drug-smuggling, gun-running, land theft and criminal violence. “I found our police force in complete disarray and riddled with corruption… add to that a rampant culture of police ill-discipline and brutality,” Kramer wrote about his first 15 months as police minister. PNG’s police commissioner David Manning, has also conceded his force includes “criminals in uniform”. Alotau Town has been seized by unrest and criminal violence in recent years, including attacks on police by armed gangs, and riots after visiting policemen killed pedestrians in a road accident. Milne Bay commander Barkie urged women who had been assaulted to lay complaints with the police. “One who did come forward…, I asked her to write a statement but she didn’t want to and instead wanted to remain anonymous to protect her marriage, she was afraid her husband would leave her if he knew she was raped, so it’s quite sad, I can’t help them if they won’t lay a report or tell me about it,” he said.
Barkie said he was working to reform the culture and practices at the station and across Milne Bay. In his three-month term as commander, four officers had been dismissed and charged over allegations of rape, murder and theft. A further eight officers have been charged with serious disciplinary offences. “And I’ve still got a long list pending. It’s a difficult thing to do, to take disciplinary actions against your own men or having them charged criminally, but [if] they have stepped out of line [they] have to be held accountable. “Someone has to do it, we have to make a stand, if we are to restore... the public’s faith in the constabulary,” he said.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1633,Police chiefs  in England to target people flouting lockdown rules,11/4/20,"Police chiefs have warned they will crack down harder on people who fail to show “civic responsibility” by ignoring coronavirus restrictions and fines as England heads into lockdown this week. Amid concerns over low compliance with self-isolation rules even before the new measures, the chief constables of five forces in the north-west of the country said they would “collectively target” the public who flout lockdown by holding large gatherings, music events and parties. In an open letter, they said a minority of people seemed “incapable of demonstrating any civic responsibility” and that they would now “face the consequences of greater levels of enforcement”. The senior officers also said they were seeking support from the government and judiciary to consider how they could rapidly bring to justice the “significant proportion” of people ignoring coronavirus-related fines.
The message from the forces covering Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside comes after a period of tightened restrictions for much of north-west England due to high numbers of Covid-19 cases. Strict new rules are expected to be rolled out for the whole of England from one minute after midnight on Thursday, including the instruction to stay at home except in a handful of circumstances including exercise and essential shopping. Last week, the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) said more than 20,000 fines had been issued in England and Wales since coronavirus restrictions were introduced on 27 March. No data was available on how many had been paid. Of these, 1,103 fines were issued in the four weeks to 19 October to people breaking England’s local lockdowns and for gatherings of more than 30 people. The NPCC said the highest level of financial penalty – £10,000 – had been issued 64 times in England and twice in Wales for people holding raves, house parties, or protests of more than 30 people. Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said there had been a remarkable level of compliance among the British public to the draconian restrictions on social contact. However, there have been concerns that the majority of people – up to 80% – fail to quarantine fully when asked to do so by test and trace. Police chiefs are planning to release data in the coming weeks on how many people have been referred to officers for breaching self-isolation. In their letter on Wednesday, the senior officers said they had seen first-hand “the misery the pandemic has caused” but had received “great support from the majority of our communities”. They said their forces had taken a “very measured” approach to enforcement and used a model of “engage, explain, encourage and only as a last resort enforce” in relation to issuing fines. The public wanted a “consistent and robust” approach to enforcement and that the introduction of local restrictions had seen forces take a “firmer stance” over restrictions and move more quickly to issue fixed-penalty notices, they added. Addressing potential rule-breakers, the chief constables added: “To the minority who feel the restrictions don’t apply to them, be prepared to face the consequences of greater levels of enforcement. “We will collectively target those who flout the restrictions, particularly those organising large gatherings and music events, repeatedly holding parties or deliberately causing harm to our communities by not following the restrictions such as self-isolating where necessary.” The letter was signed by Darren Martland, the chief constable of Cheshire constabulary, Michelle Skeer, the chief constable of Cumbria constabulary, Ian Hopkins, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, Andy Rhodes, the chief constable of Lancashire constabulary and Andy Cooke, the chief constable of Merseyside police.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1634,Police investigate if Vienna attacker was part of wider network,11/4/20,"Austrian police are investigating whether an Islamist terrorist who killed four people in Vienna on Monday night was part of a wider network and if the attack could have been prevented. Kujtim Fejzulai, known to authorities as a sympathiser of the Islamic State group, which claimed credit for the murders, is believed to have been the lone gunman in the attack despite hours of uncertainty over whether accomplices remained at large. The 20-year-old dual citizen of Austria and North Macedonia was shot dead nine minutes into the attack in central Vienna. Police in Austria carried out raids at 18 properties linked to the attacker on Tuesday and made 14 arrests. Two men were also arrested in the Swiss city of Winterthur, near Zurich, after reports Fejzulai had met them in Switzerland. Fejzulai is also believed to have travelled to neighbouring Slovakia in July accompanied by another man, where he attempted to buy ammunition suited to the weapons he used in the attack, but the sale reportedly fell through after he failed to produce a firearms licence.
Slovakian authorities are said to have informed their Austrian counterparts at the time. The men travelled in a car registered in the name of the mother of an Islamist known to police. Austria’s interior minister, Karl Nehammer, said on Tuesday that Fejzulai was known to the authorities as a sympathiser of Isis. He had been sentenced to 22 months in an Austrian prison on 25 April 2019 for affiliation to a terror organisation, after attempting to cross from the Turkish border – where he had met two Germans and a Belgian – into Syria. The sentence was suspended in December last year on condition he would be regularly monitored by probation services and would participate in a deradicalisation programme. Nehammer and the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, both of the conservative People’s party, have criticised his premature release from jail. Nehammer said Fejzulai had been able to deceive his mentors in such a way that they registered no early warning signs of his radicalisation. He said it pointed to “a faultline in our system”, which had allowed for “a premature release of a radicalised person”. Alma Zadić, the justice minister, of the Green party, defended the decision, saying it was legal and that he had been released on parole. The justice ministry later said it had not been informed about Fejzulai’s attempts to buy ammunition in Slovakia, saying it would have been reason to arrest him. The government was meeting on Wednesday to discuss the security situation and whether the attack might have been prevented. Reinhold Einwallner, of the Social Democratic party, said he was astounded that the attacker’s attempt to buy ammunition, particularly when his affiliation with Isis was known, had not triggered a security alert. “It should have caused alarm bells to ring,” he told the Austrian newspaper Kurier.
He called for a more intense exchange of information between the justice and interior ministries about people considered a security threat, saying: “the number of IS [Isis] returnees is of a manageable size.” The justice ministry said it had not been informed about Fejzulai’s attempts to buy ammunition in Slovakia, saying it would have been reason to arrest him. The populist far-right Freedom party said the role of the intelligence service urgently needed to be examined. “There are numerous indications that this terrorist and the circles he moved in, had been on the intelligence services’ radar for a long time. And if that was the case, why was this terrorist not taken off the streets?” Herbert Kickl of the party said. Nikolaus Rast, a lawyer who acted for Fejzulai, said his client had drifted through life and was “easy prey” for terror groups. “He left the impression on me of being a young man searching for something, who didn’t know what his place in society was, who had failed to find an appropriate apprenticeship position and was therefore easy prey for certain groups,” he told the tabloid Bild. Three men, two of Turkish origin and another who is Palestinian, were being hailed as heroes for having risked their lives at the scene of the attack to help some of the injured. Mikail Özen, 25, and Recep Tayyip Gültekin, 21, were about to park their car on Schwedenplatz ahead of enjoying a last coffee together before a coronavirus lockdown when the shooting started. They ran to the aid of a woman they saw lying on the ground, and Gültekin was shot at. “The attacker fired at him. But Recep was able to intuitively save himself by doing a forward roll,” Özen said. They managed to take the woman to safety. Osma Yoda, 23, who had been working in a McDonald’s on the square, was helping his boss carry boxes when they came across the gunman. “He was hidden in a closed garage entrance and was shooting at passersby,” the Palestinian man said. When two police arrived, the gunman shot at them, striking one of them. “I dragged him behind a concrete bench and tried to stop the bleeding,” Yoda told Kurier. “He continued to fire from a distance of around 20 to 30 metres. There was blood everywhere.” He then helped officers take him to a nearby ambulance, assisted by Gültekin and Özen, who are both amateur martial artists. The men were received by both the Turkish ambassador in Austria and the mayor of Vienna, who thanked them for their actions. A police officer on duty on the night of the attack described the confusion and chaos as he and colleagues attempted to secure the bars and restaurants in the area. “The bullets kept coming and we were rescuing injured people, but we didn’t know where to take them, because we didn’t know where the arsehole was,” he told the Austrian news agency APA. The 27 people injured, who sustained both gunshot and stabbing wounds, were said to no longer be in critical condition. Among the dead was said to be a female student at the University of Applied Arts.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1635,Prosecutors in Brazil file embezzlement charges against Jair Bolsonaro's son,11/4/20,"Jair Bolsonaro’s eldest son has been formally accused of embezzlement, money laundering, misappropriation of funds and directing a “criminal organisation” as sleaze allegations continue to swirl around the family of Brazil’s far-right president. Prosecutors in Rio de Janeiro announced late on Tuesday that they had filed the charges against Flávio Bolsonaro, 39, a senator whose affairs have been under the spotlight since the eve of his father’s January 2019 inauguration. The accusations, which Flávio Bolsonaro has previously called part of a political plot against his father, revolve around suspicions the president’s son engaged in a widespread but criminal practice in Brazilian politics known as the “rachadinha” when he was a Rio congressman from 2004 to 2018. Under the scheme, which translates roughly as the “salary split”, corrupt politicians siphon off a chunk of their employees’ publicly funded wages for personal gain. Charges were also filed against 16 others including Fabrício Queiroz, a former police officer and longtime friend of Brazil’s president who had worked with Bolsonaro’s son and has well-documented ties to Rio’s underworld. Queiroz is under house arrest after being detained in June on the property of a lawyer who has represented Jair and Flávio Bolsonaro. The Rio newspaper O Globo said the charges were partly based on testimony from a former aide called Luiza Sousa Paes, who told investigators she was required to return more than 90% of her salary. Paes claimed that over a six-year period she had paid about 160,000 reais (more than £20,000) to Queiroz.
A judge must accept the charges for the case to advance. In a statement, Flávio Bolsonaro’s legal team called the allegations baseless: “This is nothing more than a macabre and ill-conceived tale.” Jair Bolsonaro made no immediate comment. But the accusations are the latest embarrassment for the former army captain who swept to power in 2018 portraying himself as a Trump-like outsider and anti-corruption crusader who would drain the Brazilian swamp. That reputation has gradually crumbled because of suspicions over his eldest son and investigations into his other two politician sons, Carlos and Eduardo, over alleged financial irregularities and the allegedly illegal dissemination of disinformation. They also deny wrongdoing. Brazil’s first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, has also reportedly found herself in investigators’ crosshairs with claims she received a series of mysterious payments from Queiroz. Bolsonaro snapped at a journalist who asked about those payments in August, replying: “What I’d really like to do is smash your face in, yeah?” Brazil’s left celebrated the charges against Bolsonaro’s son tweeting the news with the hashtag #FlavioNaCadeia (#FlavioBehindBars). There was also criticism from the right, including from disillusioned former Bolsonaro backers such as the conservative congresswoman Joice Hasselmann. “THE SALARY SPLIT IS THE THEFT OF PUBLIC MONEY AND CROOKS BELONG IN JAIL!” she tweeted.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1636,South Korea detains suspected defector who crossed heavily fortified border,11/4/20,"South Korea has detained a North Korean man who it believed was trying to defect by crossing the heavily armed land border separating the two countries. The man was first seen crossing barbed wire fences shortly before 7.30pm on Tuesday, according to South Korean media reports. He was apprehended at 9.50am on Wednesday after surveillance equipment spotted him at the eastern end of the demilitarised zone [DMZ], a 248km-long (155-mile) strip of land strewn with mines.
It was not clear if the man was a soldier or a civilian, although reports said he was not in uniform. “An investigation is planned to find out details about the man, including how he had come down and whether he wished to defect,” South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said in a statement. The defence ministry declined to confirm a Yonhap news agency report saying the military had issued a “Jindotgae” anti-infiltration alert for the eastern border area. The incident comes within weeks of a South Korean fisheries ministry official being killed after crossing into North Korea via the countries’ maritime border, sparking a rise in tensions amid claims that North Korean soldiers had shot him dead, doused his body in fuel and set it alight. The South’s intelligence agency said this week it had “circumstantial evidence” indicating that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, had launched an investigation into the shooting. Very few of the 31,000 North Koreans who have defected to the South in the past two decades have done so via the DMZ, which is the scene for occasional military skirmishes but also the setting for cross-border talks during times of détente. Most defectors cross into China and arrive in the South via a third country, often Thailand. In 2018 a North Korean soldier defected to South Korea via the eastern part of the DMZ, while another was shot at by his compatriots when he ran across the border in a dramatic escape to the South in 2017. South Korea resumed tours to its side of the border village of Panmunjom on Wednesday, a year after they were suspended due to an outbreak of African swine fever in the North and, more recently, concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. The South’s unification minister, Lee In-young, did not mention the suspected defection at a ceremony held on Wednesday to mark the tours’ resumption, but called for free travel among all Koreans within the DMZ and for recently severed inter-Korean hotlines to be reinstated. “Re-establishing round-the-clock communication channels would be a basis for restoring inter-Korean relations,” Lee said. North Korean state media has not commented on Wednesday’s incident at the border, which has separated the countries since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. South Korea said it had not observed any unusual activity by the North’s military.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1637,Tory-linked firm involved in testing failure given new Â£347m Covid contract,11/4/20,"The UK government has awarded a new £347m Covid-19 testing contract to Randox, the Tory-linked private healthcare company whose testing kits had to be recalled over the summer because of concerns about contamination. The deal is a six-month extension of an existing contract and was agreed without other companies being invited to bid. It means the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has now approved transfers of nearly half a billion pounds in taxpayer funds to the Northern Ireland-based company since the pandemic began. Disclosed in a filing on a European contracts website, the award has prompted concerns about “cronyism” and calls for an independent inquiry into the £12bn spent so far on attempting to control the pandemic through the test-and-trace system. Critics raised further concerns about a separate revelation that the Conservative MP Owen Paterson, who is paid £100,000 a year to act as a consultant for Randox, was party to a call between the company and James Bethell, the health minister responsible for coronavirus testing supplies.
The disclosure raises fresh questions about Paterson’s continuing work for Randox, and the efficacy of the code of conduct for MPs, which is supposed to limit their work as paid lobbyists and regulate access to ministers. “Legislators must not also be lobbyists,” said a spokesperson for the campaign group Transparency International. The Green party MP Caroline Lucas said: “We urgently need an independent inquiry into where public money is going as many firms who have benefited seem to have links to the Tory party or individual ministers. “The lack of transparency around Covid-related contracts is a scandal. At the very least, ministers owe MPs an explanation, and we are still not getting one.” Randox provides tens of thousands of kits a week to care homes and individuals testing themselves at home, which are then posted back to its laboratories in County Antrim. Concerns were raised in July when spot checks revealed some kits supplied by a Chinese manufacturer and sent out by Randox were not sterile.
The company was ordered to recall 750,000 unused kits. The failure delayed plans to provide regular testing for English care home residents and staff, a promise on which the government has yet to deliver. In May, the Guardian revealed that Randox was awarded a first government contract on 30 March, worth £133m. It was awarded in a closed process, without being publicly advertised beforehand and without any other companies being asked to bid. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) revealed on Wednesday that the contract was for 2.7m kits – meaning the cost per kit was just over £49. The new deal was signed on 2 October and was expected to run for six months, until the end of March 2021, a spokesperson said. The government has been bypassing normal rules on holding open competitions for public sector contracts under emergency powers designed to speed up the process during the pandemic. The latest Randox deal was awarded as an extension to the existing contract, again with no other companies invited to bid.
The call between Randox, Paterson and Lord Bethell took place on 9 April, days after the company had secured its first contract to provide testing services. Bethell, who ran a political lobbying firm before entering the House of Lords, is the minister for innovation in the DHSC. He has led efforts by Boris Johnson’s government to use private sector companies in the pandemic response. Billions in public funds have been awarded to companies such as Deloitte, which helped set up a network of drive-in test centres, and Serco, which runs the contact-tracing call centre. The call with Bethell was revealed in the quarterly disclosure of ministerial meetings, gifts and trips, where the reason for the call is listed as “to discuss Covid-19 testing”.
A government source said the conversation with Bethell was a “courtesy call” from the minister to Randox and took place after the initial contract had been signed. Paterson was participating as a paid consultant to Randox on the call, the source said. Paterson, who is the MP for North Shropshire, has disclosed in parliament’s register of interests that he is paid £8,333 for 16 hours of work a month by Randox. Paterson and Randox did not respond to a request for comment. Challenged last year about his work as a consultant for a number of private companies, Paterson responded: “My financial interests have been correctly declared according to the rules of the House of Commons.” The Guardian has previously reported that Hancock toured Randox’s laboratories in Antrim last year to inspect a tool for diagnosing sepsis. Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act suggest Paterson also took part in the visit.
Steve Goodrich of Transparency International UK said the government should return to open tenders. “That hundreds of millions of pounds of procurement can go ahead without even a whiff of competition is bad enough, yet when these deals are awarded to those with political connections it reeks of cronyism,” said Goodrich. “Government really needs to get back into the habit of competitive tendering or risk irreparably damaging confidence in its prudent management of public money.” “MPs and peers must scrupulously avoid the perception – or reality – that they are working as lobbyists for private interests,” Goodrich added. “When parliamentarians with outside employment meet government concerning their client’s commercial operations, it looks an awful lot like they’re trying to influence ministers in return for payment. Parliament should tighten its rules to make it absolutely clear that legislators must not also be lobbyists.” A DHSC spokesperson said in an emailed statement: “We are proud to be working with a number of partners on innovative solutions to increase capacity where it is needed and introduce larger-scale testing. This includes an extension of an existing contract with Randox Laboratories, as we continue to increase testing capacity.”",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1638,Turkey resists calls for tougher measures to tackle Covid-19 surge,11/4/20,"Turkey is resisting implementing tough measures to combat Covid-19 despite fears that a second wave of the coronavirus is taking hold in the country and as several European states declare new lockdowns. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, announced on Tuesday that restaurants, bars, hairdressers, barbers, cinemas and all other similar entertainment venues and businesses across Turkey would have to close at 10pm. Flexible working hours across both the private and public sectors were encouraged, he added, and mosques and schools would remain open for now. Turkey’s total numbers of cases and deaths are still much lower than those of several European countries, but the number of cases is increasing at a rate of more than 2,000 a day – the highest level since the first wave of the pandemic hit Turkey in April.
Doctors and opposition politicians have alleged for months that Turkey’s caseload is in fact much higher. They have asked the government to do more to curb the spread of the virus and accused the authorities of a cover-up – a charge Ankara denies. An admission from the health minister, Fahrettin Koca, in September that the country was excluding symptomless cases from its daily tally drew widespread fury from opposition campaigners, who claimed Ankara was prioritising the struggling economy over public health. The new measures announced on Tuesday were criticised by Turkish healthcare workers’ and doctors’ unions as not going far enough.
“Healthcare workers are the only ones really tackling the problems of the pandemic at the moment. We should be supported with thorough policymaking to fight it, but instead we are the ones who are burning out,” said Lutfi Çamlı, the head of the İzmir chamber of physicians. “It’s hard to even comment on these new measures because we are not even aware of what the real situation is, we can’t get the information from the government. If they were transparent it would be different.” More than 100 healthcare workers have died and 40,000 have been infected with Covid-19 in Turkey since the beginning of the crisis, leading to several protests over working conditions and a lack of protective equipment. The Turkish Medical Association has been criticised by Erdoğan’s coalition partner, Devlet Bahçeli, the head of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), who has accused doctors of “treason” and said the association should be closed down. Wearing masks in public and in workspaces is compulsory, and some parts of the country have been subject to localised lockdowns and curfews for over-65s since measures banning all intercity and international travel were lifted in July.
Although the Turkish authorities have not publicly suggested reimplementing travel restrictions, on Tuesday Koca urged people in Istanbul not to leave the area, saying the city of 17 million people accounted for 40% of Turkey’s Covid-19 cases. “If you are in Istanbul. Do not leave [the city]. You could be a spreader without symptoms, you could be an undetected contact. Unless it is necessary, delay your trip,” he tweeted. Last week’s earthquake that hit İzmir has left hospitals bracing for a rise in cases, after many of the city’s 3 million residents abandoned social distancing measures in the aftermath. A total of 114 people have been confirmed dead and more than 1,000 were injured in the quake, putting extra strain on intensive care units and medical resources across the country.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1639,UK Covid-19 daily death toll rises to 492 – highest since May,11/4/20,"The UK death toll from coronavirus has risen by 492 – almost 100 more than the previous day’s increase. Wednesday’s total of people who died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 was the highest since 19 May, when 500 deaths were reported, and was 24% higher than the 392 recorded on Tuesday. This is despite the fact that figures on Tuesdays are often larger because of a delay in reporting deaths over the weekend. The government’s official coronavirus death toll for the UK since the pandemic began is now 47,742. Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies for deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate, with additional data on deaths that have occurred in recent days, show the number of deaths from Covid to be around 63,000. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director of Public Health England, said: “Sadly we know that the trend in deaths will continue to rise over the next few weeks. As the new measures come into place it will take some time for the impact to be seen.
“We have all made sacrifices and they have helped to save many lives. Let’s stick with it to keep our loved ones safe. The fewer people you see, the more you’ll help stop the spread.”
The government figures showed a further 25,177 people had tested positive, the second highest total after 21 October, when there were 26,688 positive results. Testing capacity has increased significantly since the first wave of the pandemic. Wednesday’s number of new positive cases was 26% greater and more than 5,000 higher than the equivalent figure on Tuesday, which was 20,018. There are 12,320 people in hospital with Covid-19, with 1,142 in hospital beds, according to the latest figures. The number of hospitalised patients was 19% greater and almost 2,000 higher than Tuesday’s total.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1640,Why are people losing their heads over a black Anne Boleyn? | Arwa Mahdawi,11/4/20,"Poor Anne Boleyn has had a rough go of it. She was married to Henry VIII, a wife-killing tyrant whose legs were covered with pus-filled boils. And, after failing to give her husband a son, she was beheaded on spurious treason charges. Then, to add insult to injury, Boleyn was stuck with a horrible reputation for the next few centuries. And she is still ruffling feathers from beyond the grave. Henry VIII’s second wife is the subject of a new Channel 5 series; she is to be played by the black British actor Jodie Turner-Smith. Predictably, racists are losing their heads over it. (I’d wager many of the same people who think a black woman shouldn’t play a white historical figure have zero issues with Jesus being routinely portrayed as a white guy.) I’m sure Turner-Smith will make a brilliant Boleyn but, to be clear, I don’t think there’s anything particularly progressive about the casting decision. There is, I think, a widespread misconception that “diversity” means plugging non-white talent into white stories and spaces. What’s far more important is diversifying the sorts of stories that we tell. Boleyn’s story is fascinating but it’s also very familiar. Meanwhile, there are plenty of non-white queens with beguilingly bloody backstories that few people know about. Take Ranavalona I, the Queen of Madagascar from 1828 to 1861, for example. She cut ties with European powers, staged coups and murdered people with poisonous nuts. I’d watch that show. Or Queen Arwa (no idea why that example came to mind), who ruled Yemen from 1067 until 1138. She reportedly avenged her father-in-law’s murder by luring his killer into a trap and sticking his head on a pole. I’d watch that show, too. So while a black Boleyn is brill, the moral of this story is that we need even more diverse screen queens. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1641,Why falling Covid cases in Liverpool are not an argument against lockdown,11/4/20,"MPs who want to avoid a second lockdown have seized on falling rates of confirmed coronavirus cases in Liverpool as evidence that the three-tier Covid alert system is bringing the virus under control and should be given more time to work. There is good reason to believe that the top tier of restrictions have had an impact in Liverpool. When the tier system was announced on 12 October, and Liverpool entered tier 3, the number of cases the previous week stood at 3,440. That figure has fallen steadily ever since, reaching 1,828 by 29 October. The decline is precisely what was hoped for, but there are subtleties in the data that are causing government advisers to pause. Prof Chris Whitty told MPs on the science and technology committee that the fall in confirmed infections in the north of England was driven by younger people and brought about by what he called real and artificial effects: a levelling off and perhaps a decline in positivity rates, but also a slight reduction in the uptake of tests.
What concerns advisers most is that they do not see a convincing decline in infections among the older age groups – those most vulnerable to developing severe disease, being hospitalised and dying from the infection. “The data are still tracking up in all the data that I have seen in the older age groups who are the ones who are likely to translate into hospitalisations, intensive care unit cases and deaths,” Whitty said. Because of the lag time between infections and deaths from coronavirus, the impact of the tier system, brought in only three weeks ago, will only start to show in the death data this week or next. The latest data for Liverpool, up to 31 October, show that deaths have risen fairly steadily since the tier system came in, from a seven-day average of 5.4 to 6.9 deaths a day. There is a hint that the rate is slowing, but it is not convincing. When the tier system came in, scientific advisers made clear that the baseline restrictions in the highest, tier 3, were unlikely to be effective enough to bring the R value below 1 and suppress the virus. Their assessment now is that in some areas in the north of England, R seems to have been pushed down close to 1 but may not have been driven any lower. “We do not have, in my view, clear evidence that R is below 1 anywhere that we actually have significantly high rates,” Whitty told the MPs.
The risk is that the top tier holds R close to 1 when the rate of new infections is still high, meaning that large numbers of people, if not rapidly rising numbers, are still admitted to hospital, where a sizeable proportion will die. It locks in a high prevalence of infections. The lockdown is intended to push cases down faster. MPs voting on the lockdown are not helped by the prime minister’s timing. The full impact of the three-tier system has yet to be seen. But waiting two or three weeks more could be extremely costly given how late restrictions were brought in. According to Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, the number of coronavirus patients in English hospitals has risen from 2,000 at the beginning of October to nearly 11,000 today, the equivalent of 22 hospitals’ worth of Covid patients. Faced with rising infections and deaths across the country, and some hospitals, such as Liverpool, already above their spring peaks for Covid patients, advisers are not keen to sit back and watch what happens.",,Foreign,Guardian,4
1642,Wings and a prayer: Thai Airways launches 'sacred' flight over Buddhist sites,11/4/20,"Thai Airways has launched a special flight that will cruise over 99 holy sites, allowing passengers to chant Buddhist mantras from the sky, in its latest attempt to boost its revenue. The airline was struggling even before the coronavirus pandemic, and the closure of Thailand’s borders has been a devastating blow. The company has launched a number of novel initiatives to raise cash in recent months. It has put bags made from life vests and slide rafts on sale, and opened an airline-themed cafe selling in-flight meals in Bangkok and a food stall selling dough fritters. It has also opened its Airbus and Boeing flight simulators to the public. The new flight will not land at any destinations, but will fly over temples in 31 provinces before returning to Bangkok. Passengers will be given a prayer book and special meal, and tickets range in price from 5,999 baht (£149) to 9,999 baht (£248). Several other airlines have launched “flights to nowhere” during the pandemic, including the Taiwanese carrier EVA, which has sold journeys from Taipei, and Japan’s ANA, which offered Hawaii-themed flights after its service to Honolulu was suspended. Indonesia’s national airline, Garuda, has sold its in-flight meals as takeaways, and Singapore Airlines has been charging customers up to £360 a head for dinner on a stationary plane. The pandemic has cost airlines tens of billions of dollars. Thailand, where tourism accounts for up to 20% of GDP, remains mostly shut to foreign travellers. Only small select groups of tourists are allowed to enter the country. Thai Airways is attempting to restructure 245bn baht (£6bn) worth of debt.",,Foreign,Guardian,4

1657,Save nothing for best': Guardian readers on lessons of lockdown,11/5/20,"As we wake up to the first day of a second national lockdown in England, millions of people are facing at least a further four weeks of staying at home. Although many in the north and Midlands have lived under restrictions for some time, the new countrywide measures that came into force from midnight will mean everyone is now subject to more rigorous restrictions. Guardian readers share what they learned from the first national lockdown, and how they plan to use that knowledge as a second one begins. ‘You shouldn’t save anything for best’ In April, 34-year-old Katie Davies lost her father. The experience made her realise that time was short, and she vowed not to continue to wait to do, or use, things that would give her joy.
“In the first lockdown I learned that you shouldn’t save anything for best”, she said. “It’s a bit of a habit in my family. My nana said that any new coats were too new to wear straight away; they had to acclimatise to the wardrobe for a bit first and then only brought out on Sundays.” She continued: “I’d had my second daughter in January and caring for two babies, meant I was stretched beyond capacity emotionally, with very few coping mechanisms available.” Struggling to get shopping slots and avoiding supermarkets in case of catching coronavirus, Davies and her mother raided the cupboards and discovered items saved as gifts, and never used. “Picnics outside with the children meant actually using a teapot with real leaf tea , risking the fancy cups, two of which did get broken,” said Davies, who lives in Wigan. “I still have real leaf tea most days, six months on, and a sense of a parallel universe in which my dad died and a pandemic hit us,” she added. “One tea canister my mum found was a year out of date, past its best. My dad ran out of time to do what he wanted to. Drink the best tea, use the fancy cups.” ‘Be stricter about switching off’ For Eleanor*, who lives in London and works in tech, a second lockdown calls for more defined boundaries between work and life. Without access to an office, she has found switching off “super difficult”, and raised concerns that many employees were working much longer hours remotely. “For many of us that have stressful jobs and live alone in small flats, the lack of boundaries with work and the increased demands of work have been hard to manage,” she said. “I live alone, and don’t have children, and there’s an expectation that because you don’t have to look after others, you can just keep working,” she added. “It’s unhealthy.” Eleanor said she plans to be “stricter” about clocking off from work on time, and introduce more time to switch off. “I’m going to put an alarm on, and even if the work isn’t done, I’m going to close the laptop, because the demands don’t stop,” she said. “I’m also going to try and have less screen time. Instead of lounging about on Netflix, I’m trying to read.” ‘A little gentleness goes a long way’ For 36-year-old social anthropologist Connie Smith, the constant saturation of news about coronavirus was “overwhelming”.
“Following minute-by-minute live streams of news can feel like a duty, and how we show we care about what’s going on,” said Smith, who lives in Manchester. “Lockdown forced many of us to slow down, get off the treadmill, and that change of pace became an opportunity. But if we take it all online, we lose that opportunity to slow down.” Instead, Smith has decided to focus on things that are within her control, sharing small moments of kindness to herself and others. “I learned to take things more slowly,” she said. “You can take time to do something small for yourself or someone else that feel tiny, but can have a big impact. Watch a bird out the window, help a neighbour, smile with my eyes, stop being impatient in the queue. Planting seeds on your windowsill. It’s a small thing, but it’s an investment in the future.” “Lockdown is traumatic and stressful,” she added. “We should remember that a little gentleness goes a long way. ‘Make sure you have a support network’
In Lincoln, engineer Jonny Codling thinks the best way for people to get through the second lockdown is to make sure they have a support network. “It’s really important for people to be able to confidentially lean on each other if they need to,” said Codling, 29. COBL (Cathedral on Bailgate Lincoln) cycling club was set up by Codling and five other people in June to help create a community of support offering outdoor rides and talks on mental health. “It just snowballed,” he said. “It started off with people just asking advice but now we have 80 members and since the summer we’ve seen this positive wave of people wanting to get together and ride.” “I think people were receptive to the idea because a lot of them felt isolated during the lockdown in March. When we got together I think members appreciated the social aspect of what we could offer.” It’s been difficult for Codling who has not been able to work for most of the year. “I’ve racked up some debt, but it’s the happiest I’ve ever been. The club has people from the ages of 15 to 60, and some of them have never ridden before. “We had a few rides outdoors during the summer but now we can’t meet up we’ve started indoor rides where people can take part at home using a turbo trainer (where you take off the rear wheel of your bike and attach it on), and a virtual reality app which lets you feel as if you’re cycling outside. We can all video chat together and still feel connected. “Now that we have this incredible support network we’re hoping it will help get us through this next period of isolation.” ‘Reach out to people and go on plenty of walks’ For healthcare assistant Libby Telling who lives on her own in Hereford, the lockdown in March was incredibly difficult. “I felt very isolated,” said Telling, 58. “I’ve had agoraphobia and panic disorder since 2019. Work was keeping me sane, but I got a viral infection in April and was off for three weeks.”
Telling said she felt “cut off” during lockdown even though she was able to speak to her four children on social media, and is “not looking forward” to another one. “You get lonely living on your own, and you become introspective. I’ve realised that it’s not good for my mental health. “This time round I’ll be reaching out to people more and going for walks which will help distract my mind. It also gives you a different perspective on life and gets you out of a cycle of anxious thinking. It’s going to be hard, but I think I’ll get through it.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1658,Activists hail bill to make violence against LGBT people a hate crime in Italy,11/5/20,"Activists in Italy have hailed a vote in the lower house of parliament to pass a bill that would make violence against LGBT people and disabled people, as well as misogyny, a hate crime. The bill, which passed successfully despite months of protests from far-right and Catholic groups, now needs approval from the upper house, where it is backed by the ruling coalition parties, before becoming law. “If we succeed in definitively approving this law, Italy will finally be a country that accepts LGBT rights, because right now we are among the last countries in Europe for the social acceptance of LGBT people,” said Alessandro Zan, the Democratic party politician who drafted the law. “Moreover, it also criminalises hate against disabled people and misogyny, so it’s a very advanced law.” Zan expects the law, which would see people convicted of such crimes jailed for up to four years, to be enforced before next spring. The law would be an extension of an existing law that punishes racist violence, hatred and discrimination. The passing of the bill in the lower house comes after a series of high-profile attacks against gay and transgender people. In September, Maria Paola Gaglione, 22, was killed after her brother rammed his vehicle into the motor scooter she was riding on with her transgender partner, Ciro Migliore, in Naples. The brother, who has been charged with manslaughter, told investigators he didn’t intend to kill his sister but instead wanted to “teach her a lesson” over the relationship. In late June, a 25-year-old man was brutally attacked by a gang of seven people as he walked hand in hand with his boyfriend in the Adriatic city of Pescara.
Rights’ groups receive hundreds of hate crime reports each year but many go unpunished. Although Italy approved same-sex civil unions in 2016, the country has lagged behind its EU partners in creating anti-homophobia measures. Attempts by various governments over the past three decades to enact a similar law have either been stifled or sabotaged, with any progress or even just meaningful debate stymied by a macho culture, Catholicism and support for far-right parties. Matteo Salvini’s far-right League and Brothers of Italy, led by Giorgia Meloni, protested against the law, arguing it would suppress freedom of expression. The Italian bishops’ conference also said the bill marked “the death of liberty”. The law would permit an increase in funding for groups that work to fight against discrimination and assist people who are the victims of it. “It will also put into play awareness campaigns in schools,” said Zan. Luisa Rizzitelli, an LGBT and women’s activist, said the law was also an important tool to help counter misogynistic attitudes towards women. “There is so much hate simply because you are a woman,” she said. “This law is a very strong signal. Not only does it make misogyny a crime, but at a cultural level it means our country accepts that the problem exists, as often misogyny becomes violent – people will be more aware that this behaviour is not right and now there will be a way to punish the perpetrator.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1659,Alok Sharma met Prince Charles three days after staffer's Covid test result,11/5/20,"Alok Sharma met Prince Charles at Clarence House three days after a staff member in the business secretary’s private office tested positive for Covid-19, it has emerged. The Guardian disclosed this week that the employee in Sharma’s inner circle received the positive result last Monday, after a union health and safety inspection report had identified concerns over social distancing in his office. Sharma had a meeting involving the individual on the Thursday before the test result, and the pair were in the department’s Whitehall office the following day. Sharma then flew to South Korea on the Saturday, where he continued meeting foreign dignitaries after being informed of the positive test, while other colleagues were forced to self-isolate. Now the Guardian has learned that once back in the UK, Sharma met Charles last Thursday. An entry on the court circular for 29 October states: “The Prince of Wales this morning received the Rt. Hon. Rishi Sunak MP (Chancellor of the Exchequer). His Royal Highness afterwards received the Rt. Hon. Alok Sharma MP (Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy).” A spokesperson for Sharma stressed that Clarence House was made aware of the confirmed Covid test in Sharma’s office before the meeting, and it was agreed that it should go ahead as he did not have symptoms and had not been told to isolate. They said Sharma had had no “close contact” with the staffer who tested positive. The department has refused to say how long Sharma’s meeting with the employee who tested positive lasted or the number of staff forced to isolate. Separately, it was confirmed on Thursday that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had entered self-isolation. The Foreign Office said Raab had been informed that an individual with whom he had been in recent close contact with had tested positive for coronavirus. “In line with government regulations and NHS track-and-trace rules, the foreign secretary has taken immediate steps to self-isolate for the required period. He will continue to work remotely during this time,” a spokesman said. The government says a person who catches coronavirus can be infectious from up to two days before they are symptomatic, for up to 10 days thereafter, and can pass on the infection even if they have no symptoms. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization states: “The time from exposure to Covid-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days.” If an individual is informed by NHS test and trace that they are a “contact” of someone who has caught Covid-19, by law they must isolate for 14 days from their last point of contact with the person. Charles contracted coronavirus in March, and later said he “got away with it quite lightly” after experiencing only mild symptoms. It emerged this week that Prince William tested positive for Covid in April, which was not made public at the time. There have been documented cases around the world of individuals catching the disease twice, including in the US where researchers last month reported the country’s first confirmed coronavirus reinfection. Unions representing civil servants wrote to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) permanent secretary, Sarah Munby, last month to express “extreme concern” following confirmed cases there. There are understood to have been two other recent Covid cases among BEIS staff. A Public and Commercial Services (PCS) health and safety inspection of BEIS’s office carried out on Thursday 22 October – the same day of Sharma’s meeting including the individual who has tested positive for Covid – noted: “Ministerial offices, especially SoS [secretary of state], were very crowded and by far the busiest part of the building … We believe there are too many people (8 PO staff when we inspected) routinely in the SoS’s private office to enable social distancing and so protect the health and safety of all staff.” A spokesperson for the business secretary, who previously pointed out Sharma had tested negative before and after his South Korea trip, said: “The business secretary had no close contact with the staff member who tested positive at any stage. At no point has Mr Sharma been told to self-isolate either by NHS test and trace or through the NHS Covid-19 app, because he and the staff member were not in close contact at any stage. “Clarence House was informed of the situation ahead of the meeting and it was agreed it could progress as planned as Mr Sharma did not have symptoms and had not been told to self-isolate. Mr Sharma has followed all of the government’s guidelines at all times.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1660,Arctic time capsule from 2018 washes up in Ireland as polar ice melts,11/5/20,"When the crew and passengers of the nuclear-powered icebreaker ship 50 Years of Victory reached the north pole in 2018, they placed a time capsule in the ice floe. The metal cylinder contained letters, poems, photographs, badges, beer mats, a menu, wine corks – ephemera from the early 21st century for whomever might discover it in the future. The future came pretty swiftly. The cylinder was found this week on the north-western tip of Ireland after floating an estimated 2,300 miles from the Arctic Circle, where global heating is melting a record amount of ice.
Conor McClory and Sophie Curran, surfers from the village of Gweedore in county Donegal, were checking sea conditions when they spotted the tube on the shore at Bloody Foreland, a beauty spot named for the red hue of the rocks at sunset. “When I saw it, first I thought it was a steel pipe of a ship, then I lifted it and saw there was engraving on it. I thought it was a bomb then,” McClory told the Donegal Daily. “When I saw the date on it I thought it could be somebody’s ashes, so I didn’t open it.” A Russian friend of a friend translated the engraving and told McClory it was a time capsule, so he opened it and discovered messages in Russian and English from the 50 Years of Victory’s polar expedition. One letter in English, dated 4 August 2018, said: “Everything around is covered by ice. We think that by the time this letter will be found there is no more ice in Arctic unfortunately.” McClory tracked down one of the letter’s authors, a Russian Instagram blogger in St Petersburg known as Sveta. In a Zoom call, Sveta said the crew and passengers had thought the cylinder might be discovered in 30 or 50 years and expressed shock it was found so quickly, McClory said.
In the past decade, Arctic temperatures have increased by nearly 1C. Arctic sea ice has reached its second-lowest extent in the 41-year satellite record. Last year the Greenland ice sheet lost a record amount of ice, equivalent to 1 million tonnes every minute. With annual snowfall no longer enough to replenish snow and ice lost during summer melting, scientists fear it has passed the point of no return. A Nature Climate Change study predicts that summer sea ice floating on the surface of the Arctic Ocean could disappear entirely by 2035. For €29,600 (£26,740) the Russian-owned 50 Years of Victory takes passengers on 14-day expeditions to the north pole, calling it a “magical destination”.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1661,Australian exporters scramble as fears of more China trade bans grow,11/5/20,"The Morrison government has accused China of heightening trade risks and breaching Xi Jinping’s own public pledges as a range of Australian export sectors brace for new disruptions as soon as Friday. Guardian Australia understands some Australian wine exporters have suspended shipments to China, based on requests from their Chinese import partners, amid fears officials in Beijing are about to press ahead with bans on a raft of goods. Lobster exporters have also been trying to clarify the hold-ups they have experienced since late last week. While the trade minister, Simon Birmingham, hit out at Beijing for sending “continued uncertain and inconsistent messages”, some Australian-based analysts argued the Chinese government was engaging in “psychological warfare” by flagging vaguely defined potential sanctions that may or may not eventuate.
The state-run Global Times published an article late on Wednesday saying Australia was nervous about losing access to the Chinese market after China “halted seven categories of Australian goods from the market”. The article did not provide new details but treated the development as fact, even though China’s commerce ministry had earlier in the week dismissed “rumours” of potential disruptions to Australian wine, lobster, sugar, coal, timber, barley and copper from Friday onwards. The apparent confirmation of looming trade actions coincides with the third China International Import Expo, which is being held in Shanghai this week. Xi, the Chinese president, reportedly told the opening ceremony he aimed “to turn the China market into a market for the world, a market shared by all, and a market accessible to all” in order to “bring more positive energy to the global community”. But Birmingham said the inconsistent messages from China about what was happening with Australian exports were “heightening risks” and also undermined “the statements made by President Xi” at the import expo. “If China is to be true to the statements of its government then it should provide confidence that normal customs and related processes will apply to imports of goods such as seafood and wine,” Birmingham said in a statement. Hours before Birmingham issued the strongly worded statement, Scott Morrison, the prime minister, told reporters: “China has denied that is what they are doing and I can only take that at face value out of respect for the comprehensive strategic partnership we have with China.” Dr Jeffrey Wilson, a trade expert who is the research director of the Perth USAsia Centre at the University of Western Australia, said he believed China’s tactics were a case of “grey-zone” diplomacy. “The ambiguity is by design,” he said. “It’s not a trade war, it’s psychological war.” Wilson said the uncertainty was “principally designed to strike fear into a large number of Australian companies … that their shipments to China might not get cleared”. China is Australia’s number one trading partner, making up 33% of Australia’s total exports. Sowing that fear, he said, would “provide additional ballast” to those commentators who were pressing the Australian government to soften its stance towards China in an effort to “fix” the relationship. Wilson said the moves also sent a message to import partners who may be thinking of doing business with Australian exporters at the trade fair this week. Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute, said China wanted Australia to pay a price for their political disagreements, especially the call for the international inquiry into Covid-19. “Whether or not the hard ban goes into place on Friday, Chinese importers of all sorts of goods have been sent an unmistakeable signal by the [Chinese] government, that it is pointless building business ties with Australia, because they can be interrupted overnight because of politics,” McGregor said. “So even if business doesn’t stop this week, it is going to come to a stop at some point, so why bother investing in the relationship.” Guardian Australia understands wine exporters have still not had anything officially confirmed, but several have suspended shipments to China to avoid any risk at the border. This step was taken at the request of importers. However, one of Australia’s biggest operators, Treasury Wine Estates, which makes Penfolds, is believed to have continued business as normal with China this week. Shares in Treasury Wines Estates fell by 8% on Thursday, after it informed the stock market it had become aware China’s domestic drinks industry was lobbying Beijing to impose retrospective tariffs on Australian wine. That domestic request was associated with an ongoing anti-dumping investigation into Australian wine that was launched by China’s commerce ministry in August and is scheduled to take up to 12 months to complete. Wilson questioned how it would even be possible for authorities to implement back-dated tariffs on products that had cleared customs, been sold and consumed.
“I’ll be honest with you: I have a PhD in trade policy from the Australian National University and I’ve never heard of retrospective tariffs in my life,” he said. While Australian and Chinese officials continue to talk through diplomatic channels, Australian ministers have reported being unable to reach their Chinese counterparts for several months. Birmingham said earlier this week that this situation had not changed but the Australian government remained keen for dialogue. China’s embassy in Australia has not commented directly on the potential new trade actions but has referred Guardian Australia to comments from the foreign ministry spokesperson on Tuesday “that the Chinese authorities take inspection and quarantine measures on imported products in accordance with laws and regulations”. China’s foreign ministry urged Australia to “bring the bilateral relations back to the right track”.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1662,Boris Johnson says four nations working on family Christmas plan,11/5/20,"Boris Johnson has announced plans for people across the UK to be able to spend Christmas with their extended families, while conceding that the government’s test-and-trace system “hasn’t had as much impact as we would have wanted” in reducing the spread of coronavirus. The prime minister used a Downing Street press conference alongside Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, to try to push the message that people should abide by the four-week lockdown in England. Johnson and Stevens noted that 11,000-plus people were in hospital with coronavirus, and said that without public compliance over the lockdown, the NHS could struggle badly. “This second wave of coronavirus is real and it’s serious,” Stevens said, comparing the current number of Covid patients with the 3,000 that would be seen during a bad winter flu season. “This is not speculation, this is fact,” he said, a reference to scepticism among some Conservative MPs and others about projections of the potential impact of a new surge in Covid without the lockdown. Official figures released on Thursday showed that another 378 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, bringing the UK total to 48,120. There were also a further 24,141 lab-confirmed cases, bringing the UK total to 1,123,197. Separate figures for deaths where the virus has been mentioned on the death certificate show there have now been around 63,000 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK. The UK Statistics Authority criticised ministers earlier in the day for the use of data and predictions during pre-lockdown briefings at the weekend, saying there needed to be more transparency about how they were used. Stevens showed only one chart at Thursday’s press conference, which plotted actual hospital admissions caused by Covid over recent months. “Sometimes the charts can be a bit hard to keep up with,” he said. Johnson said the government and the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were “working together on a joint approach to the Christmas period, because all of us want to ensure families can come together wherever they live”. “I know many of you are anxious, weary and quite frankly fed up with the very mention of this virus,” he said. “But I want to assure you this is not a repeat of the spring. Schools, universities and nurseries are all staying open. And these measures, though they are tough, are time-limited. “The advice I have received suggests that four weeks is enough for these measures to make a real impact. So these rules will expire, and on 2 December we plan to move back to a tiered approach. There is light at the end of the tunnel.” Johnson set out what he said were the three strands to being able to “put the coronavirus back in its box”: better treatments for the illness, testing and the prospect of a vaccine. Questioned about figures showing that only 59.9% of close contacts of people who test positive for coronavirus are being reached and asked to self-isolate, Johnson said he accepted that the test-and-trace system could be better. “It has come in for a lot of criticism, and clearly it has taken too long for people to get their results sometimes. But they are improving,” he said. “It hasn’t had as much impact as we would have wanted. But there’s no doubt that by identifying people who have the disease, and identifying the localities where people have the disease, being able to get the R down in a way I don’t think we would have otherwise done, it’s had an effect.” Highlighting plans to roll out mass, near-instant tests, with a pilot under way in Liverpool, Johnson said he hoped that such technology would “offer a real way forward through this crisis”. Asked about vaccines, Johnson and Stevens expressed optimism that at least one of the many in development would prove effective, with the PM likening this to the “number of shots raining down on the goal”. Stevens declined to criticise the timing of the new lockdown. Government scientists had first advised a “circuit breaker” shutdown to stem infection rates in September. He said the NHS had spent the summer catching up with cancelled routine operations. “When the facts change you’ve got to act in accordance with those new facts, and quickly,” Stevens said.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1663,"Brexit may reduce our food shipments to Northern Ireland, says Sainsbury's",11/5/20,"Sainsbury’s has said the supply of some fish, dairy and meat products to its stores in Northern Ireland could be significantly reduced from January because of Brexit. Simon Roberts, the chief executive of the supermarket chain, said on Thursday: “If we don’t get greater clarity on the Northern Irish situation then we will see a restriction on the ranges of products we can sell. This is not one or two products in stores I am talking about, it is a substantial number of products and quite key, everyday products too.” Supermarkets’ supply chains will be hit by Brexit whether there is a free trade deal or not between the EU and the UK because the Northern Ireland protocol kicks in at 11pm on 31 December. Under the deal struck by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, fresh food coming into the region from Great Britain will be subjected to checks including customs declarations, and health certification protecting the island of Ireland from outbreaks of infections such as salmonella. Roberts said the industry was pushing for clarity as soon as possible on trading with Northern Ireland post-Brexit to prevent shortages in stores there from January. He said the industry had a “productive” meeting with government last week and wanted something akin to “trusted trader status” to help the flow of goods. “Customers expect to have access to a full range but [it] won’t be possible to make that available unless something changes,” Roberts said. Sainsbury’s has 13 stores in Northern Ireland, and its experience will be mirrored by its rivals Tesco, which has 55 stores in the region, and Asda, which has about 20 shops there. Both chains also source a lot of their products from mainland UK. Roberts said: “Customers are expecting value for money and continuity of supply. We need clarity from government to help us to be able to do that.” He said the problems could affect a “substantial number of products” including processed meat, such as mince and sausages, as well as fish and dairy items. Marks and Spencer said on Wednesday that its business in Ireland could be affected if no deal was agreed with the EU, and significant tariffs and bureaucratic costs were added to food imports – a development local business leaders have been warning about since January. It is understood supermarkets are also concerned that the EU has yet to grant a third-country listing, which would confirm that the UK conforms with EU regulations. While that listing is privately expected to be granted, the lack of clarity has put food suppliers, including Scottish seed potato companies, which sell into Northern Ireland, under “incredible strain”, according to Holyrood’s environment minister. With 55 days to go before the end of the transition period, there are many other outstanding issues affecting food suppliers in Great Britain, including the labelling and rules applying to food with ingredients from outside the EU. While significant differences remain in negotiations between the UK and EU, trade talks on Brexit are expected to continue from Sunday. If a deal can be struck it is expected that products that are more than 50% British will qualify under a rules of origin regime for tariff-free and quota-free sales across the EU. Under the Northern Ireland protocol, EU rules will apply in the region, so supermarket chains transporting food to shops in Belfast, Enniskillen or Derry will also have to satisfy rules of origin specifications. This requirement could affect the sale of biscuits, for example, if the grain has been sourced from Ukraine or elsewhere. Dominic Goudie, the head of international trade at the UK’s Food and Drink Federation, said: “Producers are now preparing for this worst-case scenario and many are planning to stop supplying the Northern Ireland market after 1 January 2021, to make as yet unconfirmed changes required for product labelling or while they assess if it remains a viable option for their business.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1664,Captain in fatal migrant boat journey to Canary Islands jailed for eight years,11/5/20,"A boat captain who smuggled migrants from Morocco to the Canary Islands has been jailed for eight years and ordered to pay more than €160,000 in compensation after a woman and a one-year-old girl drowned while attempting to reach Europe last year. Another woman is believed to have died in the accident but her body has never been found. On Wednesday, a court on the island of Gran Canaria found Abdallah Wazri, 29, a Moroccan citizen, guilty of two counts of involuntary manslaughter and one count of crimes against foreign citizens. The court heard that Wazri had packed 30 people – including 11 women and three young girls – into his boat, which was 5.5 metres long and 2.5 metres wide, for the five-day journey from northern Morocco to the Spanish archipelago in May last year. His passengers, who were from sub-Saharan Africa and north Africa, were charged about €1,000 each even though the boat was “fragile, unstable and ill-suited to transporting so many people on a crossing lasting days”. The court heard the vessel lacked sufficient lifejackets as well as the necessary provisions and drinks to cover people’s basic needs. According to the judgment, as the boat neared the port of Arguineguín in Gran Canaria on the night of 16 May 2019, “the captain performed a hurried and risky manoeuvre to bring the boat to shore, which led the vessel to collide with a rock and several people to fall into the sea”. A middle-aged woman drowned, as did the baby girl. Wazri jumped into the sea just before the boat hit the rock and swam to shore. He was arrested in the city of Las Palmas on Gran Canaria two weeks later. The court said testimony from police officers and witnesses had provided a disturbing picture of the atrocious conditions aboard the boat. One of the passengers told of having to sit with his head bent over his knees for almost the entire voyage. “Almost all the witnesses gave similar accounts of the miseries they suffered on the journey, during which they were piled on top of each other, unable to move and left without supplies, which were scarce and which soon ran out,” the judgment continued. “The forensic reports are as revealing as the witness testimony. They show that people were suffering fatigue because of hunger and were generally weak because of the conditions in which they found themselves.” The court concluded that Wazri’s fatal manoeuvre – “whether brought about by clumsiness, tiredness and/or haste” – had led to the death, by drowning, of at least two people. It also noted that more than half the passengers had stayed on the beach close to the accident site, while others had fled to avoid the police. The verdict comes less than a week after at least 140 people travelling to the Canaries from Senegal died in the deadliest shipwreck recorded so far this year. UN refugee and migration agencies have warned of a huge rise in the number of people risking the dangerous Atlantic route to Europe over recent months. According to figures from the International Organization for Migration, 11,006 people have arrived in the Canaries since January this year, with 4,925 arrivals in October alone. Last year, 2,557 migrants arrived in the archipelago, up from 1,307 in 2018. An estimated 414 people have died trying to reach the Canaries so far this year, almost double the 210 deaths recorded in 2019.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1665,China bans non-Chinese arrivals from UK as England enters lockdown,11/5/20,"China has barred non-Chinese travellers from the UK, Belgium and the Philippines, imposing new border restrictions in response to the worsening Covid-19 pandemic. The Chinese embassy in the UK said on Wednesday that China’s borders were now closed to those arriving from the UK, including those with valid visas and residence permits. The measure, a reversal of recently loosened restrictions, comes as England began a month-long lockdown in an effort to stop a resurgent outbreak. The country has the highest death toll in Europe of almost 48,000 deaths. “This is a temporary measure taken by China in response to the current pandemic,” the Chinese embassy in the UK said.
The embassy in Belgium also released a statement announcing restrictions for nationals traveling from Belgium, which has the highest per capita number of cases in Europe. On Thursday, the embassy in the Philippines, which has among the largest number of cases in south-east Asia, followed suit. The notices said the new restrictions would not affect those with diplomatic, official or courtesy visas or crew members of international flights, trains or other vessels. Beijing, which has for months largely contained the outbreak and seen the Chinese economy begin to recover, also imposed new rules on those who are allowed in. As of Friday 6 November, all passengers from the US, Germany, the Czech Republic and France must have tested negative for the Covid-19 virus as well as for antibodies within 48 hours of travelling. Passengers from Denmark are subject to the rule from 7 November. Starting on 8 November, those travelling from Australia, Singapore and Japan will be subject to the same rule. Officials have said that the antibody test is to guard against false negatives in nucleic acid tests. A negative test for the antibody immunoglobulin M, or IgM, the body’s first response to the virus, would indicate that a person has never been exposed or that they have been infected and recovered. Chinese residents have watched warily as the pandemic continues to spread in Europe and the US. As the UK prepared for its new lockdown, news of the number of private jet bookings circulated Chinese social media with the hashtag “Rich Brits take private jets to escape second lockdown” attracting more than 60m views. “The whole continent of Europe is in a mess. What’s the difference?” one user commented in response. Another said: “No place is clean. Escaping is not possible.” Another, commenting on the looming lockdown, said: “To put it bluntly, what they are doing is not shedding a tear until they see the coffin.” • This article was amended on 5 November 2020. An earlier version said that the presence of antibodies shows that a person has either never been exposed to the virus or has been exposed but recovered; this should have referred to the absence of antibodies, or a negative test.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1666,"Covid immune response faster and stronger post-infection, scientists say",11/5/20,"Scientists have found the strongest evidence yet that people who recover from Covid may mount a much faster and more effective defence against the infection if they encounter the virus again. Researchers at Rockefeller University in New York found that the immune system not only remembered the virus but improved the quality of protective antibodies after an infection had passed, equipping the body to unleash a swift and potent attack if the virus invaded a second time. “It’s very good news,” said Michel Nussenzweig, the head of molecular immunology at Rockerfeller and a senior author of the study. “The expectation is that people should be able to produce a rapid antibody response and resist infection in a large number of cases.” It is unclear how long the immune system’s memory might last, but Nussenzweig said it could potentially provide some protection for years. The discovery may explain why verified re-infections from the virus are so far quite rare. When people are infected with coronavirus, the immune system launches a multi-pronged attack. One form of protection comes from T cells, which seek and destroy infected cells, and so prevent the virus from spreading. A second front involves B cells, which release antibodies into the blood. Antibodies latch on to the virus and stop it from invading cells in the first place.
Once the infection has passed, the immune system stands down, but it remembers the virus by storing so-called memory T cells and memory B cells. Should the virus return, these are immediately called to action. Many studies have shown that the first wave of antibodies to coronavirus wane after a few months, raising concerns that people may lose immunity quickly. In their study of 87 coronavirus patients, the US researchers confirmed that antibodies wane, falling to about a fifth of their peak level over six months, but this may not matter too much, they believe. When the researchers examined the immune system’s memory, they noticed that six months after infection the antibodies made by memory B cells had evolved to become more potent. These highly honed antibodies could be unleashed within days of re-infection, rather than taking a couple of weeks to build up, as seen in primary infections. The scientists went on to show that tiny amounts of coronavirus, or protein fragments from inactive virus particles, lurked in patients’ intestines and apparently helped to maintain the immune system’s memory. The remnants of the virus are not thought to be harmful. “The take-home lessons are that people who have been infected, six months later have persistent B cell memory responses with antibodies that can neutralise the virus and can do it very well,” Nussenzweig said. That could mean wiping out the virus before it takes hold, he added. “We don’t know how long any protection will last, but it might be a really long time. It could be years.”
The study is preliminary and has not been peer-reviewed or published in a journal. Charles Bangham, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, said the work suggested there was “a very good chance that if you’re re-exposed, you’ll make a brisker immune response” to the virus. “It remains to be proved that it’s protective, but you would be reasonably confident it would have some beneficial effect,” he said. Arne Akbar, a professor of immunology at University College London, said: “This is good news for everybody who has been sick with coronavirus.” He said the immune system was like an army that stands down once the threat is over, but remains prepared for a future invasion. “You want the army to be generated again very quickly, and this is what these researchers have found.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1667,Covid vaccines: Scott Morrison announces two new deals but Australia ‘at end of long queue’,11/5/20,"Australia’s efforts to secure the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine candidate may be compromised by huge global demand and a lack of local manufacturing capability, experts say, as Labor warns that Australia may struggle to distribute it at the required temperatures. On Thursday, Scott Morrison announced Australia had reached two new deals for Covid-19 vaccines, one for 10m doses with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and another with the US corporate Novavax, which would supply 40m vaccines. That adds to the two prior deals struck with AstraZeneca/Oxford and the University of Queensland and further diversifies the vaccine types available to Australia, as researchers race to find a safe and effective candidate. The Pfizer candidate is an mRNA-type vaccine, a new technology never before approved for clinical vaccine use, which works by giving cells the instructions they need to produce the viral proteins that trigger an immune response to Covid-19.
Australia currently lacks any mRNA vaccine manufacturing capability, forcing it to rely on imports only. Its order of 10m doses, at two doses a person, would only be enough for 5 million Australians, and Pfizer has already struck deals to give hundreds of millions of doses to the United States, Japan and the EU. The Australian government says it has priority access and estimates the Pfizer vaccine supply would first begin to arrive in early 2021, ready for use if the candidate proves safe and effective. But Prof Thomas Preiss, a molecular biologist with the Australian National University who specialises in mRNA, said there is a significant possibility the manufacturing of the mRNA vaccine will be constrained. He has urged Australia to pursue a two-pronged approach to supplying the Pfizer vaccine, by importing what it needs for urgent vaccination and establishing a local manufacturing capability in parallel. “The key issue here is that there are potential global capacity constraints with manufacturing mRNA vaccine doses … for the entire world population,” he said. “As this is a novel vaccine technology, no country or company had really contemplated making therapeutic mRNA at that sort of scale until recently.” Assoc Prof Archa Fox, an expert on RNA with the University of Western Australia, said Australia will be “at the end of a long queue” to obtain the Pfizer vaccine if it passes clinical trials.
Importing enough doses would also likely cost $1bn. Setting up local manufacturing would cost a fraction of that, Fox said, though it would take time to train staff and establish capability. “The lack of capacity to make mRNA is both a threat and an opportunity for the Australian biotechnology sector,” Fox wrote for the Conversation. “Given the speed at which this technology has been applied to Covid-19, it would be useful to have this production capacity in Australia, so we can quickly respond to future pandemics.” The vaccine must also be stored at temperatures below -70C at all times, complicating distribution significantly. It requires a network of suitable freezers, dry shippers, or liquid nitrogen tanks to supply the vaccine across the country. Labor says Australia currently has “no capacity to do this”. “So even if it was ready tomorrow, we couldn’t use it. That’s a big problem,” the shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, said. “We are keen to see further detail of the government’s touted vaccine roadmap. Who is in, who is out, the pathway to secure more, and how we get it in the hands of Australians.” Bowen’s comments drew a sharp response from the health minister, Greg Hunt, who said distribution for the Pfizer mRNA vaccine within Australia had already been secured. He said the government was undertaking thorough planning to ensure vaccine distribution at the required temperatures, with tenders to be issued on Thursday to coordinate the process. “Indeed, the manufacturer has humiliatingly refuted Chris Bowen’s statement. Sometimes, Chris, it is better to remain silent if you have no idea what you are talking about,” Hunt said in a statement. Preiss said the distribution of mRNA vaccines would pose significant challenges in remote areas. “I believe Moderna [another mRNA vaccine] requires -20 degrees whereas Pfizer requires -70 degrees. Minus-20 freezers are available throughout Australia’s medical infrastructure, whereas -70 freezers are more likely restricted to hospitals rather than at GP locations,” he said. Other experts suggested distribution would not be a significant problem. Prof Colin Pouton, of Monash University, said ultra-low freezers are widely used and operate at -80C. “Lower temperatures can be obtained using storage in vapour phase above liquid nitrogen [at or below -140C],” he said. “Transporting vials can be done in granules of solid carbon dioxide [dry ice] in an esky. This is freely available and sublimes at a temperature of -78C.” Pouton said the more difficult issue would be the volume of material needed to be transported.
Australia is attempting to diversify the vaccine types it secures, according to health department secretary Prof Brendan Murphy, and now has two protein vaccines, one viral vector vaccine, and Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine. “We have diversified our strategy and we have the capacity now to start vaccinating the Australian population in the first quarter of next year, which is a terrific outcome and gives us a very, very strong position internationally in access to vaccines,” Murphy said on Thursday. Both Fox and Preiss say there are other benefits to establishing local RNA manufacturing. mRNA can also be used for other non-vaccine purposes, including promising therapies for cancer and other genetic diseases. “RNA therapeutics is potentially a disruptive technology and in this way Australia could become a leader in an expanding new hi-tech industry and export to the world,” Preiss said.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1668,Deal struck to enable EU to block budget payments to rogue members,11/5/20,"Brussels will be able to block budget payments to rogue EU governments that undermine the rule of law or the independence of judges, under a hard-fought agreement between the European parliament and member states. In what was described as the “end of a painful phase” for the EU, a provisional deal has been struck, which will allow a qualified majority of member states to impose sanctions where governments fail to maintain democratic standards. Procedures under article 7 of the EU treaties were launched against Poland in 2017 and Hungary in 2018 over alleged attempts by the governments to undermine the independence of their judges. But the current system requires unanimity among the member states before sanctions, such as the removal of voting rights in Brussels, can be imposed. The rightwing governments in Poland and Hungary have said they will protect each other from such measures. Under the new mechanism, there would be greater accountability over EU payments through removal of that veto. The European commission will establish whether any principles have been violated and then propose sanctions. A suspension of payments from the bloc’s seven-year budget and coronavirus recovery fund could be enforced in response to “breaches of the principles of the rule of law in a member state” or where governments “seriously risk affecting the sound financial management of the EU budget or the protection of the financial interests of the EU”. EU countries would then have one month to adopt the sanctions proposed by the commission by a “qualified majority”, which means at least 15 of the 27 countries representing at least 65% of the bloc’s 450 million citizens. The targeted member state could trigger an “emergency break” to allow an extra two months of talks over a possible compromise. But once the sanctions have been agreed they must be implemented within seven months. “We are ending a painful phase,” said Petri Sarvamaa, the Finnish MEP who helped lead to the European parliament’s negotiators with the member states over the mechanism. “If we had left this regulation too vague, toothless, then the ship would have continued to stay off the course indefinitely. This is what happened actually … Just look at what has happened in the US in the last four years … We want to avoid that situation in Europe.” Katalin Cseh, a Hungarian MEP in the liberal Momentum party, said the agreement would prevent the prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orbán, and others from using the EU as a “cash machine”. She said: “Hungary is not a functioning democracy any more. Orbán and the government will fight to the death to stop the functioning of this. But I hope we have found something to stop this kind of violation.” The deal must now be officially endorsed by a qualified majority of the EU’s 27 member states and a majority in the parliament. But MEPs and the member states are remain in dispute over the total size of the seven-year budget and coronavirus recovery fund, in a row that threatens its timely distribution. The parliament wants to secure additional funding beyond the €1.8tn (£1.6tn) agreed by EU leaders earlier this year. Cristian Terheş MEP, from the Romanian Christian Democratic National Peasants’ party, said the rule-of-law mechanism was an unacceptable interference by Brussels into domestic politics. He said: “The EU is shaking a chequebook rather than a gun at the head of democratically elected governments in Poland and Hungary in order to bully them into doing Brussels’ bidding. “This is a despicable interference in the lawful democratic decision-making of member states. States have constitutions and parliaments which need to be respected by Brussels, rather than being whipped into line like a badly behaved child.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1669,Denmark tightens lockdown in north over mink Covid outbreak,11/5/20,"An outbreak among farmed mink of a mutant form of Covid-19 with the potential to be resistant to future vaccines has led to the Danish government bringing in tougher lockdown measures in parts of the country. The measures were announced following the discovery of a new strain of the disease in animals bred for fur in the country’s northern regions.
Twelve people in the Jutland region have been diagnosed with infection with the new strain, and municipalities in northern Denmark will impose restrictions on residents’ movements between regions. Restaurants and bars will also be shut, said Per Bach Laursen, the mayor of the Vesthimmerland municipality. The country’s health authorities fear the new strain could prove to be more resistant against a vaccine. Kåre Mølbak, head of the State Serum Institute, the national authority for the control of infectious diseases, said the strain had mutations on its spike protein, the part of the virus that infects healthy cells. He said the strain posed a potential threat to the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines, which work by disabling the spike protein. “There is a risk that vaccines targeting the spike protein will not provide optimal protection against the new viruses occurring in mink,” a report published by the institute said.
Denmark’s health minister, Magnus Heunicke, said laboratory research had “shown that mutations may affect current candidates for a vaccine against Covid-19”. He said: “It is a threat to the development of vaccines against the coronavirus. This is why we must lead a national campaign.” The World Health Organization said it had been “informed by Denmark of a number of persons infected with coronavirus from mink, with some genetic changes in the virus”. Denmark is the largest producer of mink skins in the world, producing 40% of the world’s pelts. Mink is the country’s third-biggest agricultural export. Between 15 million and 17 million mink, kept on more than a thousand Danish farms, will be killed in an effort to restrict the spread of the virus strain. After previous Covid outbreaks 1.2 million mink were killed at 400 farms, which either had infections or were close to infected farms. There are 1,139 mink farms in Denmark employing about 2600 full-time staff.
The €800m cost of the cull policy, including compensation for affected farmers, has raised questions about the evidence for the action. “We are asking to have [the evidence] sent over so we can assess the technical basis,” a spokesperson for the Liberal party told the broadcaster TV2 on Wednesday. Tage Pedersen, the president of the Danish mink breeders association said the cull would be the end of the industry.
He said: “It is a dark day for all of us and for Denmark. Of course, we don’t want to be the cause of another pandemic but the government’s decision is a disaster for our industry and Denmark. It is a de facto permanent shutdown and liquidation of the fur industry.” The Dutch government killed the mink populations on 68 mink farms in June and announced the intention to permanently close the sites from the spring of 2021 after an outbreak of coronavirus. A survey of employees in mink farms in the Netherlands found that more than 50% had been infected by a strain of the coronavirus found in the minks. The conclusion arrived at was that many of the people could have been directly or indirectly infected by the animals.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1670,England enters second lockdown after MPs approve regulation,11/5/20,"England has begun its second nationwide lockdown on Thursday, despite a bruising vote the previous day in which Boris Johnson’s coronavirus strategy was rejected by dozens of his own MPs. Senior Tories including former leaders Theresa May and Iain Duncan Smith were among those in Wednesday’s Commons debate to attack Downing Street’s management of the pandemic, which claimed nearly 500 lives across the UK on Wednesday – up 24% on the previous day – and left more than 12,000 people hospitalised. NHS England warned that within two weeks more hospital beds could be filled than at the height of the first wave, and said its alert level would rise to 4 from Thurday, meaning the pandemic response would be handled nationally rather than regionally. The four-week stay-at-home order starting on Thursday, in which all non-essential shops and venues will have to close, is likely to be more heavily policed than the first national lockdown in March, after the home secretary, Priti Patel, told forces that Johnson expected them to “strengthen enforcement”. The House of Commons approved the new measures on Wednesday by 516 votes to 38 with opposition parties backing the government. Thirty-four Conservative MPs voted against the four-week lockdown – the central plank of Downing Street’s plan for containing the virus – and several said they could not support any extension beyond 2 December, when it is due to end. May was among those who lined up to criticise the government, saying no data had been produced to justify the rules. In a final attempt to quell a substantial revolt, Johnson had urged rebels in his party to “put differences aside”. But May said the potential need for a rolling series of lockdowns would cause “irreparable damage” to the economy and have a “significant impact on lives”, while the regional tiers system had not been given adequate time to work. Liverpool, which has been subject to tier 3 measures, had seen cases halve, which May said suggested the localised approach may be working. Duncan Smith said the data used to put England into lockdown had “unravelled in the last few days”, also pointing to case numbers in Liverpool. He said he would not vote for the government’s plan, saying he believed that the leak of the lockdown plans on Friday had “bounced the government” into announcing the measures. Many Conservative MPs were taken aback by the prime minister’s abrupt abandonment of tiered regional restrictions, which he had been robustly defending days before Saturday’s announcement. Scientists believe the R number is still above 1 in most parts of the country, meaning that even though infection rates are slowing in Liverpool and other tier 3 areas, the decline is not by enough to avoid a prolonged second wave and excess deaths. May abstained rather than vote against the lockdown measures, and Duncan Smith was among those voting against, as were a string of other former ministers including Steve Baker and Esther McVey, and the chair of the 1922 Committee, Graham Brady.
The government also published advice for people defined as “clinically extremely vulnerable” on Wednesday, hours before the lockdown was due to begin. The clinically extremely vulnerable group includes those with reduced immune systems, specific cancers or severe respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis. They are being strongly advised to stay at home at all times unless they are going out for exercise or a doctor’s appointment. People with chronic kidney disease (stage 5) and those undergoing dialysis, as well as adults with Down’s syndrome, are being added to the shielding list by the NHS due to new evidence about groups more likely to be at risk of serious illness from Covid-19. During the Commons debate, Johnson vowed that the lockdown would end on 2 December and that ministers would seek a “fresh mandate” on what came next. “It is right for members on all sides of this house to have the doubts that have been expressed, to seek answers from me, and to provide scrutiny,” he said. “But while it pains me to call for such restrictions on lives, liberty, and business, I have no doubt that these restrictions represent the best and safest path for our country, our people and our economy.” Johnson did not remain in the Commons for May’s speech, causing cries of outrage from the opposition benches. But he told MPs earlier: “I know there are many in this house who are concerned about how long these measures might last, and that if people vote for these regulations today, they could suddenly find that they’re trapped with these national measures for months on end. “So let me level with the house. Of course I can’t say exactly where the epidemiology will be by 2 December, but what I can say is that the national measures that I hope the house will vote on tonight are time-limited … They legally expire.” The prime minister reiterated that the NHS being overwhelmed could have disastrous consequences. “It means that the precious principle of care for everyone who needs it, whoever they are, whenever they need it, that principle can be shattered for the first time in our experience,” he said. “It means those who are sick and suffering and in need of help could be turned away because there was no room in our hospitals.” Brady said he would vote against the government “with greater conviction than I have in casting any vote in those 23 years [as an MP]”. He said: “I think there is an, unintended perhaps, arrogance in assuming the government has the right … to tell people whether they can visit their elderly parents in a care home, whether it has the right to tell parents they can’t see their children or grandchildren, whether it has any right – for heaven’s sake – to tell consenting adults with whom they are allowed to sleep.” Baker said he would vote against the measures “with a heavy heart,” because of doubts about the data presented to MPs. He said the UK must “improve standards in government so that never again do we see a model like this, which evaporates like morning mist under the sunlight of close inspection”. However, he said there was a crucial need for compliance with the new rules, in a dig at the prime minister’s adviser Dominic Cummings who broke the last lockdown’s rules. “No more innovative eye tests,” Baker said.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1671,Europe's second wave: anger in Italy as Covid restrictions bite across continent,11/5/20,"The leaders of Italian regions entering partial lockdown on Friday have lambasted the government’s new tiered system, which has categorised some areas with the lowest rates of Covid-19 in the country as high-risk red zones. The row, which is expected to provoke more protests against restrictions in the coming days, erupted as Italy registered 34,505 new coronavirus infections on Thursday and 445 fatalities - the highest daily death toll since 23 April. Covid-19 deaths in Italy since the start of the pandemic are the highest in mainland Europe and now stand at 40,192. Meanwhile, Greece became the latest European country to announce a return to lockdown, and Germany and Poland both reported new daily case records. The southern Italian region of Calabria – which registered 245 new infections on Wednesday – will join Lombardy, which has been worst-hit, Piedmont and Aosta Valley in partial lockdown. The restrictions mean people will be able to leave their homes only for work, health or emergency reasons. Bars, restaurants and non-essential shops apart from hairdressers will have to close. Nino Spirlì, the acting president of Calabria, said the lockdown was unjustified and that he would appeal against its imposition. “This region does not deserve an isolation that will be fatal to it,” he said.
Neighbouring Campania currently has the second-highest daily caseload in the country but has been put in the lower-risk yellow zone, as has Lazio, the region surrounding Rome. Puglia, also in the south, and Sicily are in the medium-risk orange zone, meaning bars and restaurants will have to close and people will be banned from moving beyond their towns or cities. “The decision to relegate Sicily to the orange zone is absurd and unreasonable,” said Nello Musumeci, the island’s president. The leaders of Lombardy, Piedmont and Aosta Valley have also demanded to know exactly how the tier system was decided. The restrictions, which will be in place until 3 December, are said to have been determined by the rate of Covid-19 transmission, the number of infections and people with symptoms and the availability of hospital beds. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said intensive care capacity would be at risk in 15 of Italy’s 20 regions within a few weeks unless new measures were enacted. Greece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said on Thursday that the resurgence of the virus required a three-week national lockdown that would begin at 6am on Saturday. The country recorded 2,646 new infections and 18 deaths on Wednesday, up sharply from last week. The virus has killed 673 people in Greece among almost 47,000 infected. “It was a difficult decision … but measures must be taken for three weeks to overcome this second wave,” Mitsotakis told a videoconference on Thursday. Under the measures, Greeks can leave their homes only if they receive authorisation after making an official request by phone or SMS. Only essential shops, including supermarkets and pharmacies, will be open. Unlike the previous six-week lockdown that began in late March, however, kindergartens and primary schools will remain open. Secondary school pupils will be taught remotely. University students are already doing online classes.
Germany’s national disease control centre, the Robert Koch Institute, said 19,990 infections had been confirmed over the past 24 hours, topping the previous record of 19,059 on Saturday. The country has now recorded 597,583 cases and 10,930 deaths. A four-week partial shutdown took effect on Monday. Bars, restaurants and leisure and sports facilities are closed and new contact restrictions have been imposed. Shops and schools remain open. Poland reported 27,143 new cases on Thursday, well up on the 24,692 reported on Wednesday. The government is expected to announce new restrictions to try to contain the second wave of Covid-19. Spain, which is under curfew after the declaration of a state of emergency, reported 21,908 new cases on Thursday, and 368 new deaths – the highest daily death toll to date in the second wave. The country now has a total of 1,306,316 cases. In France, which is already in a month-long national lockdown intended to put “a brutal brake” on the virus, the mayor of Paris announced that some shops that sell takeaway alcohol and food will be forced to close at 10pm to prevent further contagion. France’s public health agency said on Wednesday that there had been more than 40,500 new infections in 24 hours and 385 deaths in hospital. The overall French death toll stands at 38,674, and there are 4,089 people in intensive care. The country has 6,400 intensive care beds available nationwide.
The new lockdown allows people to leave home only to go to the office, if working-from-home is not possible; to go to the doctor; exercise outdoors; drop children off at school, or do essential shopping. Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Löfven, has gone into self-isolation after a person in his “vicinity” met with someone who had been confirmed to have Covid-19. In neighbouring Denmark, which is also facing a resurgence in cases, the prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, is also in self-isolation after the justice minister tested positive. In Ireland, however, the countermeasures appear to be paying off and the country now has one of Europe’s lowest incidence rates after two weeks of maximum tier restrictions. The R value, which indicates the number of people on average an infected person will infect, is now 0.7 and 0.9. To suppress the virus it must be below 1.
The cumulative 14-day incidence rate has fallen to 212.7 per 100,000 people, a 30% reduction. It gives Ireland the seventh lowest rate of 31 European countries, above Finland, Norway, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia and Greece. Authorities reported eight coronavirus-related deaths and 444 new cases on Wednesday, bringing the death toll since the pandemic began to 1,930. The total number of cases is 63,483. Health officials attribute the improving numbers to moderate restrictions imposed on Dublin city and county on 18 September, followed by nationwide severe restrictions on 21 October. They are due to end on 2 December, by which time authorities hope daily case numbers will be between 50 and 100. There have been a handful of small, fleeting protests. Infection rates have also fallen in Northern Ireland, but health officials have advised the Stormont executive to extend restrictions on the hospitality sector, which are due to end on Friday.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1672,Evo Morales to return from exile to Bolivia in 800-vehicle convoy,11/5/20,"Bolivia’s exiled former president, Evo Morales, is set to make a triumphant homecoming next week, leading an 800-vehicle convoy to the jungle-clad coca-growing region where he began his political career. The Bolivian newspaper Página Siete reported that Morales would cross from Argentina into the southern border town of Villazón on Monday morning before heading 600 miles north to the province of Chapare. Bolivia’s first indigenous president, who was driven into exile last November in what supporters called a US-backed coup, plans to arrive in the town of Chimoré on Tuesday, exactly a year after fleeing the same location on a Mexican airforce jet.
The return of Bolivia’s first indigenous president comes after his Movement for Socialism (Mas) reclaimed the presidency last month when Morales’ former finance minister, Luis Arce, won a landslide election victory. The former coca farmer, who led Bolivia from 2006 to 2019, has been living in Buenos Aires since Argentina’s government granted him asylum last year. Arce will take office on Sunday, 24 hours before Morales’ return, with the guest list including leftist regional leaders such as Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, and the Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro. For Morales, 61, the homecoming is a chance to celebrate a remarkable political revival by Mas and make a powerful statement about his own political relevance in a profoundly symbolic region. “It’s really the equivalent of Trump going into Nebraska and Oklahoma to have campaign rallies,” said Jim Shultz, a Bolivia specialist. The Argentinian newspaper Página/12 said Morales aides were billing the “caravan” to the Chapare as a “historic journey” that would conclude with a “great ceremony of welcome and thanks to the people”. The Mas senator Leonardo Loza told Argentina’s RadioCut that followers were preparing a “historic gathering” in Chimoré to which he hoped up to 1.5 million supporters would flock from across Bolivia.
Álvaro Ruiz, the head of the pro-Mas Federation of Municipal Associations of Bolivia, told reporters: “He will be coming back with the same strength and the same hope.” Shultz saw an intensely personal side to Morales’s journey home. “I’m sure he’s miserable being outside Bolivia. I’m sure he misses the people, the attention, the food … on a personal level I’m sure he’s ecstatic to be coming home.” But many, even within Morales’s party, are thought to be uneasy about the reappearance of a charismatic but deeply divisive figure whose reluctance to give up power contributed to the turmoil that engulfed the South American country after last year’s disputed election. Shultz said it was unclear whether Morales would be content to take a backseat role in politics or aspired to be “a behind-the-scenes kingmaker telling underlings how to run the country”. “The question is whether all we are looking at is somebody rebuilding their personal reputation and reconnecting with their support base, or whether we are looking at the opening of an alternative power base within the Mas … No one knows the answer to that question.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1673,Hong Kong police launch hotline for residents to inform on each other,11/5/20,"Hong Kong police have launched a hotline for the city’s residents to inform anonymously on anyone they allege has broken a sweeping new national security law. Critics say the measure has disturbing echoes of surveillance methods used in mainland China, will deepen divisions in the city and could be exploited by individuals trying to settle personal, business or political scores. The system allows people to send tip-offs via video, audio files and pictures to the police, without sharing their personal details. More than 1,000 pieces of information were submitted on Thursday, the first day of operation, the South China Morning Post reported. The system “replicat[es] the Chinese Communist party’s model of relying on grassroots informants,” Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said on Twitter. Hong Kong authorities said the law brought in by Beijing in June would affect only a “small minority who endanger national security”. But it has already been used to target pro-democracy politicians, activists and academics, and to curtail a year-long protest movement.
The Democratic party legislator James To said the hotline could tear an already divided city apart, and was unnecessary when the police’s existing national security unit already had “tremendous” powers. “It will be a serious blow to freedom in Hong Kong and will undermine the trust between people,” he told the local broadcaster RTHK. “Much of the reports will be related to individuals’ political opinions.” Comments on a police Facebook page promoting the site deepened concerns that some in Hong Kong hoped to use it for surveillance of neighbours with political differences. Posters said they would use it to denounce people who ate at restaurants known to back the pro-democracy movement, RTHK reported. Others made comments attacking “cockroaches”, a term sometimes used to attack supporters of the pro-democracy movement. Joshua Wong, a student activist, said the hotline carried disturbing echoes of one of mainland China’s most turbulent periods, the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. Then, neighbours, colleagues and even families were encouraged to denounce each other, with devastating and sometimes deadly consequences. “No matter where you are, your private conversations, business chats, social media posts or school lectures can be reported via this new hotline,” Wong said. “By putting ‘eyes and ears everywhere’, the hotline can also be used for business retaliation, by encouraging citizens snitching on each other and cooking up charges against business competitors, just like what happened during China’s Cultural Revolution.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1674,"Israeli forces leave 41 children homeless after razing Palestinian village, UN says",11/5/20,"Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank have razed a Palestinian village, leaving 73 people – including 41 children – homeless, in the largest forced displacement incident for years, according to the United Nations. Excavators escorted by military vehicles were filmed approaching Khirbet Humsa and proceeding to flatten or smash up tents, shacks, animal shelters, toilets and solar panels. “These are some of the most vulnerable communities in the West Bank,” said Yvonne Helle, the UN humanitarian coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territory. Three-quarters of the community lost their shelters during Tuesday’s operation, she said, making it the largest forced displacement incident in more than four years. However, by the number of destroyed structures, 76, the raid was the largest demolition in the past decade, she added. On Wednesday, families from the village were seen rifling through their wrecked belongings in the wind, with some of the first rain of the year arriving the same day. The UN published a photo of a bed and a cot in the open desert. The village is one of several Bedouin and sheepherding communities in the Jordan Valley area that is located within Israeli-declared army training “firing zones”, and despite being within the Palestinian Territories, people there often face demolitions for a building without Israeli permission. “Palestinians can almost never obtain such permits,” said Helle. “Demolitions are a key means of creating an environment designed to coerce Palestinians to leave their homes,” she said, accusing Israel of “grave breaches” of international law. Nearly 700 structures have been demolished across the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2020 so far, she said, more than any year since 2016, leaving 869 Palestinians homeless. Israel’s Civil Administration, the body tasked with running the occupation, said it had carried out an “enforcement activity … against seven tents and eight pens which were illegally constructed, in a firing range located in the Jordan Valley”. Those figures contradicted the UN statement and an on-site report by prominent Israeli human rights group, B’Tselem, which said forces destroyed 18 tents and sheds housing 11 families, 29 tents and sheds used as livestock enclosures, three storage sheds, nine tents used as kitchens, 10 portable toilets, 10 livestock pens, 23 water containers, two solar panels, and feeding and watering troughs for livestock. Israeli forces also destroyed more than 30 tonnes of food for livestock and confiscated a vehicle and two tractors belonging to three residents, the group added. “As part of its efforts to take over more and more Palestinian land, Israel routinely demolishes Palestinian homes and property,” said B’Tselem spokesperson Amit Gilutz. “But the wiping off of a whole community at once is extremely rare, and it seems like Israel was making use of the fact that everyone’s attention is currently set elsewhere to move forward with this inhumane act,” he said in reference to the US election. Israel captured the West Bank from Jordanian forces in 1967 and continues to control and occupy the area, although Palestinians have limited self-rule over small enclaves. The country’s hardline prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he intends to annex large swathes of occupied Palestinian territories, including the Jordan Valley, although the plan was temporarily “suspended” as part of a deal with the United Arab Emirates.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1675,Jacinda Ardern must use her mandate to tackle child poverty | Max Rashbrooke,11/5/20,"As the New Zealand First party’s vote share evaporated on election day, so too did Jacinda Ardern’s last excuse for not making more progress on child poverty, her signature issue. No longer able to blame inaction on her one-time conservative coalition partner, and possessing an absolute majority, the Labour leader now has a free hand on an issue dear to her heart. She may have labelled climate change her “nuclear-free moment”, referencing the 1980s Labour government’s famous opposition to nuclear weapons, but it is child poverty reduction, not climate change, that she has always taken as her “extra” portfolio. And Ardern has already made modest progress. Data released in February showed that, on seven out of nine key measurements, child poverty had fallen slightly in her first year in office. And that data was collected before her main anti-poverty initiative so far, the Families Package, had fully taken effect.
The latest Treasury modelling shows that, pre-coronavirus, Ardern was on track to achieve the 2021 targets in the Child Poverty Reduction Act, which include lowering from 16.5% to 10.5% the proportion of families with less than half the typical (median) household income. This, though, was a little bit like getting to base camp on Everest: no mean feat, but infinitely easier than the task ahead. The coronavirus-induced recession has clearly worsened some forms of poverty – just look at the food bank queues. The Treasury thinks the number of families in “material hardship” – those reporting they are unable to afford basic items – will “rise sharply”. Progress on other measures, such as the household incomes one, is likely to stall or partially reverse. Ardern’s long-term targets, meanwhile, are daunting. They require the proportion of households with less than half the typical income to fall to just 5% by 2028, for instance. It is important to stand back and appreciate the scope of this ambition. It would cut the number of children in poverty by two-thirds in a decade, placing New Zealand amongst the world’s best performers and profoundly reducing misery and marginalisation. But ambitious targets require ambitious policy agendas – all the more so as the hardest challenges are still to be met. The families helped so far will largely be those who were in relatively “shallow” poverty, needing perhaps an extra $50 a week to be lifted over the line. The families Ardern will have to help in later years will be as much as $350 a week under the poverty line, according to the 2018 Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG). And their numbers will have been swollen by coronavirus.
For all that she is supposed to be a transformational figure, Ardern has relied largely on the “third way” policies of her Labour predecessor, Helen Clark, in her fight against child poverty. The Families Package rejigged a familiar array of tax credits and payments, albeit signalling a minor shift to universalism via the best start payment for all newborns. Some more ambitious policies are on the way. The minimum wage will continue its rise towards $20 an hour, while so-called fair pay agreements will ensure that if workers win good pay rates with one employer, those conditions are spread throughout their industry. Beneficiaries will be able to earn significantly more before their benefits are clawed back, some 200,000 children will get free school lunches, and another 8,000 state houses will be built. But most experts believe these policies will be nowhere near enough. “There’s nothing in place that would give you any confidence that they have the tools to meet the 2028 targets,” says Susan St John, a founding member of the Child Poverty Action Group. At a minimum, she says, the government needs to raise core benefits by nearly 50%, as the WEAG recommended. It should also simplify and increase Working for Families payments, remove sanctions, forgive beneficiaries’ debts and make housing more affordable. Ardern’s innate fiscal and political caution will not help here. Although New Zealand’s coronavirus-induced public debt will, at 55% of GDP, be modest by global standards, she seems reluctant to spend up large on things like solving child poverty. Yet that fight, if it is to be successful, will be expensive, even if it brings immense savings – in the form of healthier, better-educated children – in the long run. St John says the government could easily spend $1bn a year – on a package that includes extending some tax credits to beneficiary families – just as “a holding position to relieve the depth of poverty”. This starkly illustrates the scale of the challenge Ardern faces. She has made it part way up the mountain: but does she have the strength for the climb ahead?

1676,Johnson urged to denounce Trump's claims of US election fraud,11/5/20,"Boris Johnson has been under pressure to follow European leaders and warn Donald Trump that he will be damaging democracy worldwide if he continues to allege ballot fraud in the US presidential election without any supporting evidence. The prime minister said on Wednesday it was not for the UK as an ally of the US to intervene in the internal politics of the country, a claim that led to charges of cowardice from Labour and contrasted with a clearer stance stance from German politicians. The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: “It is important that all politicians who reach people directly, establish trust in the electoral process and the results.” He added it would be “premature” to comment further given that ballots were still being counted. The German chair of the Bundestag foreign affairs committee, Norbert Röttgen, described Trump’s behaviour as “really unbelievable and it’s really with great sadness to many, many Germans to witness this awful behaviour”. The leadership of the Social Democratic party of Germany (SPD) accused Trump of trying to foment civil unrest with co-leader Saskia Esken saying: “In a democracy every vote counts and elections are decided by the voters.” “A candidate, even if he is the incumbent president, who calls for absentee votes not to be counted, acts anti-democratically,” Esken added. “More than ever, it is true that we have to defend our democratic achievements against populist and nationalist agitation.” Speaking on Sky news, the UK justice secretary, Robert Buckland, became the first minister to hint at any criticism, calling for a “smooth” transition of power if Trump loses the election. He said: “We are all watching, biting our nails to see what might happen in those key swing states. But the important thing from our point of view is that we want the major democracy in the world to have a smooth transition, whether it’s a change of president or whether it’s the same president, we wish them well.” Ministers will be reluctant to ring Joe Biden to congratulate him on his victory until Trump has conceded defeat, but there is a danger that the US president will not do that, and will instead challenge the result either through lengthy vexatious court challenges, or by encouraging his supporters to take to the streets. The chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat, tried to avoid direct criticism of Trump saying he supported Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell in his call to keep counting the votes, but said it would be wrong for the UK to get involved in this stage. Asked if he approved of Trump’s challenge to the results, he said: “If he has got evidence let him bring it. That is how a fair and open legal system works. If he does not then it is simply undermining the process. Keep voting, keep calm.” Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chairman of the defence select committee, sent out a warning shot. “With authoritarianism on the rise across the world, how America handles and respects the democratic process over the next 48 hours will impact on all western nations’ credibility to uphold, promote and defend hard fought standards at a time of growing global instability.” The shadow trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, told ITV’s Peston that Johnson and the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, were refusing to criticise Trump. “If he had been the leader of any other country in the world then the foreign secretary and the prime minister would have called it out.” She added: “He is behaving like a tinpot dictator… and it’s not acceptable and it should be called out.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1677,Minister blames public for second English lockdown,11/5/20,"The second national lockdown in England has been caused in part by a lack of public compliance, the justice secretary has said, adding that it will be a “huge challenge” to get the public to follow the strict rules this time. Robert Buckland suggested the public had failed to adhere to the previous system, leading to the need for the four-week lockdown starting on Thursday in England. “That’s one of the reasons we are having to take the measures we are today,” the cabinet minister told the BBC. “Sadly, it’s been difficult frankly regarding the compliance of some people with regard to the quarantine restrictions. “I think it would be very ambitious of me to suggest that somehow we will be able to use the enforcement authorities to intervene in every case I think sadly that’s not possible.” Buckland said he had not seen any of the much-vaunted Covid marshals out in public spaces but said local authorities had been given funding to expand enforcement in order to ease pressure on police. “I haven’t met any, but I know that in my local area arrangements are being made,” he said. “They will have been trained in the regulations, the dos and don’ts and that person will be a useful source of advice and encouragement to make sure we can avoid a situation where lots of people are bring ticketed for infringements.” Police have warned the public to expect tougher action after the home secretary told them to “strengthen enforcement”. Martin Hewitt, the chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), said: “Not following the regulations and measures put in place to limit the spread of the virus is unacceptable. We won’t waste time with endless encouragement for those who knowingly or deliberately break the rules. People recklessly ignoring the regulations should expect to receive a fixed penalty notice.” Priti Patel told police chiefs that Downing Street wanted tougher action, and senior government figures called for the police to be visible in enforcing Covid regulations, especially against illegal raves or wedding with a large number of attendees. There is a £200 fine for every breach that doubles on every offence, up to a maximum of £6,400, as well as £10,000 for large gatherings. Buckland said the police would use the increased fines for repeat offenders. “I think the message has to go out very clearly that this will only work if we all play our part. The majority of people do brilliantly, but we have to deal with that tiny minority who do not wish to support other people.” The government suffered a bruising vote on the lockdown on Wednesday, with Boris Johnson’s coronavirus strategy rejected by dozens of Conservative MPs. Senior Tories, including former leaders Theresa May and Iain Duncan Smith, were among those in Wednesday’s Commons debate to criticise Downing Street’s management of the pandemic.
Thirty-four Conservative MPs voted against the four-week lockdown – the central plank of Downing Street’s plan for containing the virus – and several said they could not support any extension beyond 2 December, when it was due to end. May was among those who lined up to lambast the government, saying no data had been produced to justify the rules. Buckland said the dissent in parliament was “actually fairly limited”, given the support of opposition parties. “The decision made by the Commons actually reflects the vast majority of the public who support this approach, who do not want to see a series of stop-start measures that not only disrupt life and wellbeing, but disrupt the economy,” Buckland told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1678,Nearly a third of New Zealanders felt badly distressed in Covid lockdown,11/5/20,"The wellbeing of New Zealanders plummeted during the country’s nationwide lockdown, research has found, with nearly a third experiencing “moderate to severe psychological distress” – especially young people. On 15 March Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, ordered the total closure of the country’s borders and on 26 March the entire population of five million entered a strict lockdown. From an infection point of the view the lockdown worked, but the social toll is continuing to be understood, including higher rates of depression, anxiety, and domestic abuse, as well as widespread sleeping problems. On days 19 and 22 of the nearly five-week lockdown, Otago University’s Dr Susanna Every-Palmer, head of psychological medicine, surveyed 2,000 Kiwis about their wellbeing and mental health, including questions about their levels of depression and anxiety, the state of their family relationships and if they were experiencing any positive side-effects of lockdown. Every-Palmer found “almost a third of participants experienced mental distress during the lockdown”, with 30% reporting moderate to severe psychological distress and 16% had moderate to high levels of anxiety. Almost 40% said their level of wellbeing was low. “New Zealand’s lockdown successfully eliminated Covid-19 from the community, but our results show this achievement brought a significant psychological toll,” Every-Palmer said. “Substantially increased rates of distress were seen among those who reported having lost their jobs or experienced a reduction in work as a result of the pandemic, those who had potential vulnerabilities to Covid-19, or identified their health status as poor, and those who had a past diagnosis of a mental illness.” The research also found the lockdown affected different age groups in different ways, with the level of mental distress much higher in younger adults, with almost half of those aged between 18 and 24 experiencing moderate to severe psychological distress compared to less than one in 10 adults aged 65 years and older. Every-Palmer said her team surmised the cause of this was higher levels of wellbeing among older age groups prior to entering lockdown, and higher levels of resilience learned from past exposure to adversity.
One in 10 people also reported experiencing some form of domestic abuse during lockdown, which corresponds to similar research findings from China, the US, Brazil and Australia. However the psychological impact of lockdown was not all bad, Every-Palmer said, with 62% of respondents saying there were some enjoyable aspects, including working from home, spending more time with family, and living in a quieter, less polluted environment. “People reported taking the opportunity to pause, reflect, consider priorities, recreate healthy habits, and they appreciated the environmental benefits brought by reduced travel.” Dr Dougal Sutherland, a clinical psychologist from Victoria University of Wellington, said the findings were valuable as they were captured in real time. “Although the study couldn’t tell us exactly what about the lockdown people found stressful, it is likely that a combination of health anxiety and worry about the potential economic consequences of Covid-19 played a role,” Sutherland said.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1679,Operation Moonshot: rapid Covid test missed over 50% of cases in pilot,11/5/20,"A rapid coronavirus test at the heart of Boris Johnson’s mass-testing strategy missed more than 50% of positive cases in an Operation Moonshot pilot in Greater Manchester, the Guardian can reveal. The 20-minute tests, on which the government has spent £323m for use with hospital and care home staff with no symptoms, identified only 46.7% of infections during a crucial trial in Manchester and Salford last month. This means that many of those carrying Covid-19 were wrongly told they were free of the virus, potentially allowing them to infect others.
The tests were due to be used in the UK’s first city-wide mass-testing initiative, which starts in Liverpool on Friday. There was confusion on Thursday night when the council suggested they would no longer be deployed as part of the trial, but the government later insisted that small numbers of NHS staff would be using them in hospitals. Scientists with Greater Manchester’s mass testing expert group (MTEG) raised significant concerns about the accuracy of the OptiGene Direct RT-Lamp tests this week, and said the technology should not be widely used as intended in hospitals or care homes. The findings pose significant questions about one of the main tests in the government’s mass-screening strategy, which Johnson heralded this week as the UK’s main route back to normality. The prime minister told MPs on Monday that the government was “rolling out testing of all NHS staff as fast as we possibly can” and that it wanted to introduce rapid, regular testing for hospitals, care homes, schools and universities. The Salford trial was billed as the first step in the Operation Moonshot mass-testing scheme but was drastically scaled back after just six weeks, in part due to concerns about the accuracy of the OptiGene test, the Guardian understands. Local leaders had asked the government for the clinical validity data behind the technology, but it is understood this data has not been provided. The Department of Health and Social Care said the test had been validated in three other trials which differed from Manchester’s findings, however it has not made this data public.
The MTEG, which reports to the region’s health chiefs and the Greater Manchester (GM) mayor, Andy Burnham, revealed their concerns about the Operation Moonshot findings to Martyn Pritchard, the chair of the region’s testing strategy group on Monday. In a letter seen by the Guardian, they wrote: “The current available data from the Manchester pilot shows low sensitivity (46.7%) of the Direct RT-Lamp platform,” which is favoured for use in hospitals because of its ability to produce results in around 20 minutes. They wrote that “a high proportion of samples collected from infected individuals in a ‘real world’ setting would not be detected” using the technology, and added: “MTEG have significant concerns and do not feel the data supported the investment in the large scale rollout of Direct RT-Lamp saliva testing in any of the proposed clinical settings considered (hospital staff, care staff, community settings) at this time.” The Greater Manchester experts said “technical limitations of the system were also a cause for concern”, including the lack of internal controls, and that if not addressed “these may pose a significant risk of errors”. They added: “It should be noted that solutions to these issues are not available at this time and are likely to take considerable resource and time to address. “It is also of concern that the scale of investment needed [at a ‘new department’ level] to deploy this test at a scale that would be useful and sustainable is unlikely to be cost-effective. “We remain fully committed to wider asymptomatic testing in the health and care sectors as well as in community settings, however we are not convinced that this is the right platform for widespread deployment across GM.” The experts said they would assess the tests again if there were fixes that “materially improve sensitivity”.
The hospital test is made by OptiGene, a small biomedical firm in Horsham, West Sussex. The government has paid £323m for 600 of its newly developed Genie HT machines and 90m testing kits and chemicals. Each machine can reportedly deliver up to 200 tests an hour. The DHSC confirmed that the Genie HT machines would be the primary technology deployed to test NHS staff and patients who do not present with coronavirus symptoms. They do so using two methods: the rapid Direct RT-Lamp, where a saliva sample is added straight to the machine after being made safe by heating, and the RNA Lamp, which takes longer to process because the nucleic acid has to be extracted from the sample. Prof Mark Wilcox, the co-chair of the DHSC’s technical validation group, said: “The Direct Lamp tests used in Manchester have been validated in other laboratories and in real-world testing for use in different settings. “It is incorrect to claim the tests have a low sensitivity, with a recent pilot showing overall technical sensitivity of nearly 80%, rising to over 96% in individuals with a higher viral load, making it important for detecting individuals in the infectious stage. The challenge now is to understand the reasons for the difference in claimed sensitivity in one evaluation versus those in multiple others.” The health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced a six-week trial of OptiGene’s tests at the end of May, which he said “could change the way that we control Covid-19 across the country”. The results of the trial, however, have never been made public. A separate study published last month found that it identified only 67% of infections, meaning it missed one in three cases, and advised anyone who tests negative to take a separate follow-up test to verify the result. OptiGene referred the Guardian to the DHSC. Questions have also been raised about a separate rapid saliva test which will be offered to everyone in the community in Liverpool. The public data available on the Innova test is for nose and mouth swabs only, not saliva tests. The instructions for use say “negative results do not rule out Sars-CoV-2 infection” and should not be used for treatment decisions or “infection control decisions”. The government’s Porton Down laboratory evaluated the test and approved it in August, but only for swab samples and no detailed results have been published.
Johnson earlier told the Commons that the rapid test to be used in Liverpool would be one “that you can use yourself to tell whether or not you are infectious and get the result within 10 to 15 minutes”. The Innova test, however, is for people who already have symptoms and is not approved to be self-read. Any positive case should be confirmed with the gold-standard lab-based PCR swab test. Experts, including those in Liverpool, are understood to be anxious about the performance of the tests chosen for use in the pilot scheme and to have asked for reassurance from the government. There is concern that doubts over the results will undermine public confidence and affect people’s willingness to come forward for testing. Bill Esterson, the Labour MP for Sefton in Merseyside, asked the government on Thursday to urgently publish the test’s clinical validity data and said: “It’s very worrying if unreliable tests are being used. It’s crucial that the Liverpool mass-testing pilot succeeds.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1680,Police warn public to expect tougher crackdown on Covid lockdown breaches,11/5/20,"Police have warned the public to expect tougher action against Covid rule-breakers after the home secretary told them to “strengthen enforcement” ahead of England’s second lockdown. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC), said those blatantly and deliberately flouting the regulations should expect punishment. A police source stressed this did not mean officers would start “policing people’s private lives” but officers would be quicker to fine or close premises in clear and wilful breach of the new regulations. “Not following the regulations and measures put in place to limit the spread of the virus is unacceptable. We won’t waste time with endless encouragement for those who knowingly or deliberately break the rules. People recklessly ignoring the regulations should expect to receive a fixed penalty notice,” Hewitt said. It marks a change of tone since the first lockdown, and comes amid growing concern about rule-breaking including raves. One rave attracted 1,000 people in east London at the weekend and another, in the West Country, saw attacks on police who tried to close it down, leading to a standoff lasting several hours.
Police cited an example of a Merseyside pub opening in breach of Covid regulations despite repeated warnings; in future police are likely to issues fewer warnings before enforcement action including shutting down premises. The NPCC comments came after Priti Patel told police chiefs that Downing Street wanted tougher action. Senior government figures want the police to be visible in enforcing Covid regulations, especially against the most blatant breaches such as raves and weddings with scores of people attending. While police forces are operationally independent, Patel’s spokesperson said that she had told police chiefs: “We now need you to strengthen enforcement.” The home secretary told a meeting of the National Policing Board: “I am acutely aware that we are asking more from our outstanding officers, and that they have been working flat out to keep people safe. “But the prime minister has been clear that he wants to see tougher enforcement of the necessary restrictions in order to save lives. We now need you to strengthen enforcement, and that the law-abiding majority are not endangered by those who flout the rules.” Strict new rules are expected to be rolled out for the whole of England on Thursday, including the instruction to stay at home except in a handful of circumstances including exercise and essential shopping. Last week, the NPCC said more than 20,000 fines had been issued in England and Wales since coronavirus restrictions were introduced on 27 March. No data was available on how many had been paid.
Of these, 1,103 fines were issued in the four weeks to 19 October to people breaking England’s local lockdowns and for gatherings of more than 30 people. The NPCC said the highest level of financial penalty – £10,000 – had been issued 64 times in England and twice in Wales for people holding raves, house parties, or protests of more than 30 people. Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said there had been a remarkable level of compliance among the British public to the draconian restrictions on social contact. However, there have been concerns that the majority of people – up to 80% – fail to quarantine fully when asked to do so by test and trace. Police chiefs are planning to release data in the coming weeks on how many people have been referred to officers for breaching self-isolation.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1681,Rishi Sunak's star fades as he flip-flops on furlough ... again | John Crace,11/5/20,"I suspect that even Rishi Sunak is struggling to keep up. He is the chancellor with the budget box of many colours. At a rough count there have been at least eight different statements to announce new furlough measures since March, even if only five have ever been fully implemented. Three job support schemes in his winter economy plan have flatlined and been scrapped even before they were due to be introduced. It’s hard to know if he even agrees with himself any more and hasn’t just been bullied into the changes by the prime minister. With this rate of attrition, it’s becoming increasingly hard to know which government measures to take seriously and which to ignore. On Thursday morning the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, blamed the public’s failure to comply with restrictions as the prime reason for the second national lockdown. It didn’t appear to have occurred to him that many people might have thought the government was just having another of its funny turns and would have reversed the lockdown by the time so many had got round to breaking it.
Back in September, the chancellor had been absolutely clear as he ended the first – or maybe the second (my memory is as poor as his) – bailout scheme. “I don’t think it is the right thing to do to endlessly extend furlough,” he had announced to solemn nods of agreement from Boris Johnson and Conservative backbenchers in the Commons. And yet here he was, back in the chamber, to declare that he hadn’t really meant what he had said about all those variations on reducing payments to those whose businesses and livelihoods had been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and that he was going back to plan A. Or possibly plan B. As from now, all furlough payments would be reinstated, though not to those he had either deliberately or accidentally previously excluded, until March next year, presumably to prevent him from having to come up with another bailout package after yet more lockdowns or for all those job losses as the result of the government’s failure to agree a Brexit deal. If those negotiations break down, then half the country could be on furlough.
In previous appearances at the dispatch box, Sunak has appeared urbane and in command. The man riding to the rescue with suitcases full of cash. The Del Monte man who liked to say “yes”. Even when he was offering less than before. Now though, the chancellor appeared edgy. Brittle even. As if aware he was rapidly using up all his goodwill and there was only a certain number of times you could claim to be “financially agile” and “reacting to fast-moving events” before the country began to wonder if you were actually a bit clueless and making it up as you went along. After all, the new plan looked much the same as the first plan. Knocked up on the back of the same cigarette packet, and in the time wasted with his indecision hundreds of thousands might have already lost their job. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, was in no mood to take any prisoners. She simply stated the obvious. That Sage had predicted a second wave of infections and that another lockdown was an inevitability, so why had he previously tried to cap the government support at 67% to the many millions who were likely to find themselves off work?
It was hard enough to get by on the minimum wage as it was, and 67% of the minimum wage was hardly going to make ends meet. Sunak kept his head down and said little. Unlike Boris, he has the emotional intelligence not to try to bluster his way out of awkward situations. He knows when he’s busted. The rest of the session divided along predictable lines. Northern Labour MPs wondered why 67% had been OK for regions in tier 3, but 80% was now on offer when the rest of the country was affected. Welsh MPs observed that the need for a lockdown had been so clear the country had already been in one for the last two weeks, and the Scots sensed the scheme may not turn out to be all that it seemed. They may yet be right. The Tories forgot they had congratulated the chancellor for his previous schemes and pretended this was the first time they had ever heard of a furlough. It took Peter Bone to ask the one awkward question. Great bailout and all that, but how was he going to pay for it. Sunak shrugged. Boris, meanwhile, is acting more and more like a C-list celebrity on a Channel 5 reality TV show. Ready to endure any humiliation as long as there’s a TV camera to record it. You might have thought that for the Downing Street press conference we might get a double dose of Rishi to explain all over again while he still had star quality, albeit a bit tarnished. Instead we got Boris saying precisely nothing, other than to insist again that the NHS had begged him to delay his lockdown until it was running almost at breaking point. So folks, Johnson concluded, please just do your best to comply with the rules this time so we won’t need another lockdown again immediately. Boris could have done himself and everyone else a favour and just had a word in private with Dominic Cummings. Most of us don’t need to be told there are Specsaver branches outside Barnard Castle.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1682,Russian MPs consider lifetime immunity for former presidents,11/5/20,"Russian lawmakers have introduced a bill to parliament that would give Vladimir Putin lifetime immunity from prosecution if and when he decides to leave office. The draft bill would give a former president immunity from criminal prosecution for any offences committed during his lifetime. A supermajority of lawmakers would be required to revoke the protections. Currently, ex-presidents are protected for actions taken only while they were in office. It is the second bill this week that provides special provisions for former presidents, prompting talk of whether Putin, 68, might be preparing for retirement.
On Saturday he sponsored legislation that would entitle a former president to a lifetime seat as a senator in Russia’s Federation Council, a position that also comes with immunity from prosecution. The bills follow Russia’s adoption of constitutional amendments that “reset” Putin’s term limits, allowing him to potentially run twice more for president and remain in office until 2036, when he would be 84. He has ruled the country, mostly as president, since 2000. Political analysts have differed on their interpretation of Putin’s plans. While he has cleared a path to rule for years, it is possible he simply did not want to be seen as a lame duck as he would have been forced out by term limits in 2024 – he was first elected president in 2000, then returned to the presidency in 2012. He has largely worked remotely since the outbreak of the pandemic, holding meetings from a windowless bunker and rarely appearing in public. Presidential immunity played a prominent role in Putin’s rise to power. Among Putin’s first acts as president was to issue a decree granting immunity to the former president Boris Yeltsin from prosecution, interrogations and searches of his property. The decision was interpreted by some as an incentive for Yeltsin – who was then ensnared in a Swiss investigation involving credit cards issued to his family – to step down and choose Putin as a successor. Yeltsin denied in his memoirs that there was any deal with Putin. A law on presidential immunity was adopted by Russia’s parliament in 2001. The only other living Russian to whom Putin’s new bill would currently apply is Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president from 2008 to 2012 and then stepped aside to allow Putin to return. The bill will need to pass three readings in the lower house, then the upper house, before being signed by Putin to enter into law.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1683,Spain announces plans for flying taxi service in Barcelona,11/5/20,"When Spain’s much-missed tourists and pilgrims finally return, they may be offered a novel way to rise above the crowds and appreciate some of the country’s most dramatic urban architecture. Enaire, Spain’s air navigation authority, has announced plans to begin demonstrating flying taxis in Barcelona and Santiago de Compostela in 2022. “We need to move urban mobility into the third dimension: airspace. And we need to do it as efficiently and sustainably as we can,” the authority’s director general, Ángel Luis Arias, told an online conference this week. Arias said Enaire was working on European projects involving the use of flying taxis and other flying vehicles to move people around urban and semi-urban areas, as well as the use of drones to deliver goods. He added: “Enaire, in its capacity as a public company of the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda, is willing to fulfil its duties to attract and help any private sector companies or public organisations that are interested in allowing Spain to position itself at the forefront of the development and operation of this new sector.” Enaire is participating in two EU-funded projects that belong to Horizon 2020, the union’s biggest research and innovation programme to date. One is led by the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, the other by the multinational technology company Everis. “The plan if for both projects to demonstrate air taxis in Europe in 2022,” Enaire said in a statement. “Enaire will manage the flight of the first air taxis in Spain, which will take place that year in Barcelona and Santiago de Compostela.” Passenger-carrying drones have been successfully flown in recent years by companies including China’s Ehang and the German aviation startup Volocopter. In July last year, the Spanish technology company Tecnalia unveiled its prototype for a pilotless, one-person air taxi. The taxi, designed to carry a person or load of up to 150kg, has a cruising height of between 100 metres and 300 metres, and can cover distances of up to 15km in 15 minutes.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1684,Storm Eta leaves many dozens dead across Central America,11/5/20,"Storm Eta has unleashed torrential rains, and catastrophic landslides and flooding in Central America, killing scores of people, displacing more than 300,000, and turning city streets into raging torrents. At least 50 people died in Guatemala, including 25 who were killed in a landslide in the village of QuejÃ¡, according to the countryâ€™s president, Alejandro Giammattei. He also told local radio that 60% of the eastern city of Puerto Barrios was flooded and 48 more hours of rain were expected. Authorities reported nearly 100 homes damaged by flooding and landslides in Guatemala. Footage posted on social media showed canoes navigating through the flooded streets of the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, where scores of people perched on roofs, pleading to be rescued.
â€œThe situation is serious, itâ€™s shocking and needs to be dealt with professionally, fast,â€� the Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernandez, told HCH television, pointing to reports of people stranded or stuck on roofs of flooded homes. Damage and destruction had spread across the â€œvast majorityâ€� of Honduras and speedboats and helicopters would be sent to rescue people in inaccessible areas, Hernandez said.
One of the fiercest storms to hit Central America in years, Eta struck Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane on Tuesday with winds of 150 mph (241 kph) before weakening as it moved inland and into neighbouring Honduras. By Thursday, authorities confirmed at least five deaths in Guatemala and seven in Honduras. Media in Nicaragua also reported two miners had died in a mudslide. In southern Costa Rica, a landslide onto a house killed two residents, a Costa Rican woman and an American man, officials said. A man and a woman also died in flooding in Panamaâ€™s Chiriqui province, near the Costa Rica border, authorities said. There was better news in Honduras, where the 60 fishermen who went missing on Tuesday returned after taking shelter on cays until they were reached by boats bringing food and fuel, said community leader Robin Morales. Calling their escape a â€œmiracleâ€�, Morales said a man among them presumed dead from a heart attack also made it back. â€œOur friends are alive, thank God,â€� he said.
Across swathes of Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica, high winds and heavy rain have damaged homes, roads and bridges, forcing thousands to take cover in shelters. On Thursday, Eta was a tropical depression moving north-west through Honduras toward the Caribbean at 9 mph, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Heavy rains continued but its maximum winds had fallen to 30 mph.
One unidentified woman broadcast on Honduran television made a desperate plea for help in a neighbourhood of La Lima, a municipality on the southeastern flank of San Pedro Sula. â€œIâ€™ve got five children on the roof of my house and nobodyâ€™s helping me to get them down,â€� she said. Eta is forecast to return to sea and regain momentum as a tropical storm, reaching Cuba and southern Florida in the coming days, the NHC said.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1685,Sunak now prefers risk of doing too much to risk of doing too little,11/5/20,"The past few weeks have been tough for Britain, tough for the government and tough for Rishi Sunak. The chancellor’s once glowing reputation has taken a battering in recent weeks as he has been forced to amend his support packages for the economy time and again. The latest U-turn involves extending the furlough scheme until the end of March, something Sunak said was necessary because the experience of the first lockdown was that the pain lingered even when restrictions were eased. Yet the unspoken message was that tough curbs on activity would remain in place even when the lockdown in England expires on 2 December. Rather than come back at that point, the chancellor is trying to do now what he has failed to do previously and get ahead of the curve. Sunak’s furlough pledge came just hours after the Bank of England announced it was boosting its money creation – or quantitative easing – programme by a bigger-than-expected £150bn. Again, the subtext was plain: on the day that England went into lockdown, we, the two institutions primarily responsible for economy policy in the UK, are working together and have your back. The IMF has praised the coordinated way in which the Bank and the Treasury have acted throughout the crisis and this was another example of it. There is a limit to what the Bank of England can do to boost activity, and that piles extra pressure on Sunak. Over the past couple of months, the chancellor has dropped talk of saving only “viable” jobs and is now in “whatever it takes” mode. It was significant that his latest statement did not include any mention of eventually taking steps to reduce the record peacetime deficit the UK will run in the current financial year. The risk of doing too little is seen as greater than that of doing too much. That looks like the correct call. The government is probably on course to borrow £400bn in 2020-21 but is having no trouble servicing its debt. Extending the furlough will limit – although not prevent entirely – the rise in unemployment expected over the coming months. The Bank estimates that in November 5.5 million people will be furloughed, falling to 2.5 million in December and the first quarter of 2021. That, however, assumes that restrictions after the four-week English lockdown ends on 2 December revert to the level of severity in mid-October, and there is a very good chance that fears of another surge in the infection rate will make ministers ultra-cautious about opening up the economy in the run-up to Christmas. Threadneedle Street thinks output will shrink by 2% in the final three months of 2020 but is aware that it could be worse than that.
Ultimately, there is no getting away from the fact that locking down businesses – not once but twice – comes at a cost: in this case an economy predicted to be 11% smaller in the final three months of 2020 than it was a year earlier. Everything is now about damage limitation.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1686,Tiny Japanese home 'filled' with 164 starving dogs,11/5/20,"Health officials in Japan have found 164 emaciated dogs crammed into a tiny house, in the latest case of animal hoarding that experts say is linked to poverty, isolation and the ageing population. The parasite-infested animals were found in a 30 square-metre (323 square feet) house in Izumo, a city in western Japan, last month following complaints from neighbours. Kunihisa Sagami, the head of the animal rights group Dobutsukikin, said the dogs were found crammed onto shelves and under tables and chairs.
“The entire floor was filled with dogs and all the floor space you could see was covered with faeces,” Sagami told Reuters. The increase in reports of hoarding has raised concerns about the welfare of both the animals and their owners. In the year through to the end of March 2019, local authorities received more than 2,000 complaints about homes overrun with animals, according to the environment ministry. A ministry analysis of 368 cases showed about 30% of the owners were aged 70 or over, with a significant number living with dementia. More than half of the people questioned said they were living in “difficult” circumstances, including poverty, poor health and isolation. In response, Japan’s animal welfare law has been revised to force owners to neuter or spay their pets where over-breeding is a risk, and penalties for animal abuse have been increased. Animal welfare officials now have the power to conduct an on-the-spot inspection if they suspect an owner of cruelty. “There is a tendency … to treat issues around animals lightly, but if we don’t approach the owners of these pets with a view to providing welfare, then we can’t solve the problem,” a local government official told the Mainichi Shimbun, In June, a man in his 50s was arrested after animal rights activists rescued 66 dogs he had been keeping in foul conditions in an unoccupied house. The man did not live with the animals, but visited the house every two or three days to feed them. Dogs are not the only victims. In March, 238 cats were discovered living in unsanitary conditions in a house in northern Japan before being placed under the protection of local authorities and animal rights groups. In another case that made headlines last year, animal support volunteers entered the Tokyo home of a woman and her elderly mother to find a tiny room filled with 163 cats.
Public health officials first visited the house in Izumo seven years ago after neighbours complained about the noise and smell, but the occupants – a family of three – refused to allow them in. They later told officials that that the number of dogs had multiplied because they could not afford to have them spayed or neutered. Sagami said his group would find foster homes for the dogs after the family agreed to give them up.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1687,Tory London mayoral candidate criticised over TfL bailout 'facts' site,11/5/20,"The London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey has been criticised after his team launched a “facts” website about the bailout for Transport for London that makes minimal references to its creation by the Conservative party. The website, titled Transport for London Bailout Facts, describes itself as “everything you need to know about TfL’s second bailout”. It attacks the mayor Sadiq Khan’s oversight of the authority at a time when it has needed a £1.8bn government bailout after revenues fell during the pandemic. Only at the very bottom of the page does the site state that it is “published by Kerry Halfpenny on behalf of Shaun Bailey”, before listing the address of the Conservative campaign headquarters in London. The website makes no explicit reference to the Conservative party or to Bailey’s hopes to challenge Khan for the mayoralty, meaning the website’s source may not be obvious to some readers. The “facts” claims have also been made in a leaflet campaign. The Conservatives have previously faced criticism for masquerading as a factchecking service during the 2019 general election. During the leaders’ debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, the party’s press account changed its name and branding to “factcheckUK”. Will Moy, the chief executive of Full Fact, an independent factchecking website, said the practice should be stopped, highlighting several instances of political parties and campaigners in the EU referendum creating similarly misleading materials. “It is inappropriate and misleading for a candidate for political office to brand campaign material as an independent resource,” he said. “In a democracy, voters need meaningful transparency to make informed decisions. Self-respecting politicians should make their own arguments in their own names.” The site first appeared on the Internet Archive, an automated web archive, on Sunday. Bailey does not appear to have shared the website on his Twitter account since then, but his profile contained a picture of the web address on a campaign vehicle and pictures of volunteers holding leaflets with similar designs.
Bailey had been due to go up against Khan in mayoral elections in May this year but the vote was postponed to May 2021 owing to the coronavirus lockdown. The decline in travel since the start of the pandemic has pushed TfL’s finances to the brink, and the government stepped in to bail it out at the weekend. A spokesman for Bailey’s campaign said Khan was “trying to avoid responsibility” for £9.6bn in money wasted by TfL. “Londoners have a right to know the truth,” he said. A spokeswoman for Khan said Bailey’s campaign was “deliberately lying” and described the website as “fake news masquerading as ‘facts’”. She said: “The Tories must stop trying to take Londoners for fools.” The government will step in with £1.8bn to keep TfL running for the next six months, after a heated political battle between Khan and Boris Johnson, his predecessor as mayor. In return, TfL has agreed to shelve plans to build a second Crossrail link and to investigate a possible rollout of driverless trains. Johnson and Bailey have argued that Khan was responsible for “bankrupting” TfL. Khan has described this as a “blatant lie”.",,Politics,Guardian,5

1698,A backlash against a patriarchal culture': How Polish protests go beyond abortion rights,11/6/20,"For 14 nights they have marched, enraged by a near-total ban on abortion that has stirred a generation to stage the largest mass demonstrations that Poland has seen since Solidarność toppled the communist regime in the 1980s. Until soaring coronavirus numbers and a looming national lockdown made it almost impossible, up to a million people nightly defied a government ban on protests, taking to the streets from Warsaw to Łódź, Poznań to Wrocław, Gdańsk to Kraków. The protests, led by the grassroots women’s movement Ogólnopolski Strajk Kobiet (OSK, or All-Polish Women’s Strike), have shocked the ruling conservatives and created a new political faultline that, analysts say, could spell more serious problems for the party. “I think it is a whole backlash against a patriarchal culture, against the patriarchal state, against the fundamentalist religious state, against the state that treats women really badly,” said Marta Lempart, a 41-year-old lawyer and one of OSK’s leaders.
The group has outlined areas extending far beyond abortion rights where it says urgent change is needed: stronger and wider women’s and LGBTQ+ rights in general; the separation of church and state; more support for healthcare, small businesses and education; full judicial independence.
Predominantly Catholic Poland already had one of Europe’s strictest abortion laws when, on 22 October, its constitutional tribunal ruled that terminations in instances of severe foetal anomalies, which accounted for all but about 30 of the 1,110 abortions performed legally in Poland last year, were “incompatible” with the constitution. The decision by the court’s 15 pro-PiS judges, many of them appointed unlawfully, would allow terminations only in instances of rape, incest and when the mother’s life is at risk – a tiny fraction of cases. Women’s groups estimate an additional 200,000 Polish women have abortions either illegally or abroad each year. The ruling sparked an immediate reaction. Across the country, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, mainly women and young people, took to the streets with banners proclaiming “I wish I could abort my government”, “This is war” and “Women’s hell”.
On Tuesday – apparently in response to the protests – the government indefinitely postponed publishing the court’s decision in the official journal, preventing it from coming into effect (and raising major constitutional questions if it tries to do so later). But the genie may be out of the bottle. While surveys show more than 60% of Poles support the status quo on abortion, barely 15% back the proposed changes. This has mobilised a generation not previously engaged with politics and stoked existing, wider anger at what many see as the steady erosion of democratic norms since PiS came to power in 2015. Maria Kowalczyk, 38, a beauty journalist, said at a protest in Warsaw that Poland was “years behind. In this country, because of the politics and doctrine of the government and the religious fanatics, someone who is different is worse. The way they treat LGBT people, migrants, all minorities – and now women … Society has had enough.”
Julia Estera, 30, a performance and makeup artist from Łódź, said Poland was no longer a free country. “We are a religious state where we are all demanded to think in one possible way.” Bianka, 15, and Maja, 16, said Poland’s youth would not back down. “We don’t want to live in a country where we don’t have a choice, where everything is decided for us.”
Andrzej Kompa, a historian and university researcher, said on another march in the capital that he was protesting “not just against this hell for women, decided by this so-called constitutional court, but against this government, against church involvement in political affairs, for minority rights. Simply for freedom.” Support for the PiS, who were re-elected last year, and its founder, Jarosław Kaczyński, 71, has plunged by almost 10 points to 30.9% in a month, according to one poll. Another showed 70% of Poles would like Kaczyński – widely seen as the country’s true powerbroker – to step down as PiS leader. Breaking long-held taboos, the protests have also challenged the Catholic church and its influence on Polish policy, education and culture, with some demonstrators disrupting services and defacing churches. Support for the church has fallen eight points to 49% since March, one poll showed.
Kaczyński last week urged the party faithful to call for a defence of the Catholic church “at all costs”. He also said the protests were “intended to destroy Poland”, and urged his supporters to fight for “Poland and patriotism” in order to avert “the end of … the Polish nation as we know it”. The protests could hardly have come at a worse time for PiS. As Covid-19 infections and death tolls break new records, the government – which warned this week of a new national lockdown within 10 days unless things improve – is coming under increasingly heavy fire for its handling of the pandemic. It now appears to have few easy ways out. Many Poles view the court ruling as a tactical play by Kaczyński to bolster support on the traditionalist right while bypassing parliament, where the ruling coalition has only a slender majority. It has sparked an explosion of popular fury unlike any PiS has seen.
“It certainly feels different,” said Adam Mrozowicki, a sociologist at the University of Wrocław. “We need to study it properly, but the heart of this does seem to be young people. Anecdotally, I’ve never seen this level of engagement among my students – in my faculty, maybe 70-80% of students have taken part in some kind of protest.” The scale and nature of the protests was new, Mrozowicki said: “They are led by young women. This is decentralised, locally based, grassroots. And personally, in 20 years, I’ve never seen anything like these numbers. To have 65,000 people on the streets of Wrocław …” Ben Stanley, a political scientist at the SWPS university in Warsaw, said the protests felt “qualitatively different”. Previous anti-PiS demonstrations over the rule of law mainly drew “Solidarność-era protesters, people in their 50s and 60s. It wasn’t an issue that resonated so much with young people.”
Women’s rights are “a lot more tangible for 25-year-olds; they really mean something concrete. This ruling has animated many more people by personalising the culture war PiS has declared: its chosen narrative of a Poland whose authentic identity and traditions are at threat from rootless cosmopolitanism.” The protests had “blown a hole in the idea that Kaczyński is always three steps ahead, that PiS always has its finger on the pulse of what Poland really feels”, Stanley said, “at the same time as Covid has blown a hole in their reputation for competence”. The party could salvage the situation in the short term, he said, but “processes are accelerating that will make the nationalist, clericalist PiS narrative more difficult to sustain longer term. All this may not bring PiS down immediately, but it could make things a lot more difficult in future.” Mrozowicki said it was unclear how the protests would immediately affect Poland’s politics because the protesters had no clear links to parliamentary politics, and their leaders have said they do not want to become a political movement. “But it feels like something, definitely, is shifting,” he said. • This article was amended on 9 November 2020 to remove an incorrectly translated quote.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1699,Australian exporters urge Morrison government to take China to world trade umpire,11/6/20,"A major Australian business group has called on the Morrison government to take China to the world trade umpire, saying attempted talks have failed to resolve the widening dispute with Australia’s largest trading partner. As seven export sectors braced for potential trade bans, and with ministerial level contact still frozen, the Australian Industry Group told Guardian Australia businesses would have no choice but to look for other markets “if China continues to turn its back on Australian goods and services”. While the trade minister, Simon Birmingham, described the new sanctions as “rumours” that have not been officially confirmed, Australian trade officials have urged exporters to expand into other markets because the rocky relationship between the two countries is not likely to improve in the near future. In an editorial, the state-run China Daily warned that Australia would “pay tremendously for its misjudgment” if it continued to back the US government’s efforts to contain China. The paper urged Australia to “steer clear of Washington’s brinkmanship with China before it is too late”, saying that if Canberra went out of its way to be hostile to Beijing it “will be a decision Australia will come to regret as its economy will only suffer further pain”.
The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said it was time for Scott Morrison to “act like the prime minister, not the prime observer” and move quickly to help Australian exporters who fear new trade bans affecting wine, lobster, sugar, coal, timber, barley and copper. “It’s not good enough to say, ‘Well, no one will take our calls’ while our trade continues to deteriorate,” Albanese said. “The government needs a plan to deal with this issue, because it has real-world consequences for Australian jobs, for Australian businesses and for the Australian economy.” If these new bans eventuate, they would represent the latest in a series of trade actions taken by China amid tensions over a range of issues, including Australian investigations into alleged foreign interference, criticism of China over human rights abuses, and the Morrison government’s early call for a global Covid inquiry. Australian barley exports to China have already largely stopped because of prohibitive 80% tariffs imposed in May, based on claims the product had been “dumped” at artificially low prices and because of unfair subsidies. The Australian government says it reserves its right to challenge that decision via the World Trade Organization and it is understood to have raised its concerns at a standard WTO committee meeting last week. Innes Willox, the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, said businesses would prefer Australia to have strong high-level connections with China, which accounts for 33% of Australia’s total exports, but “when talks break down we need to rely on the independent umpire, the WTO”. “China and Australia have long been united in advocating for the multilateral trading system and now might be the time to take our disagreements to that forum,” he said. “Businesses are always looking to diversify but the reality is that no other market has the size or robust demand of China, which is why Australia is just one of 125 countries who count China as their largest trading partner.” Dr Jeffrey Wilson, the research director of the Perth USAsia Centre, said referring the trade dispute to the independent umpire was a credible option for Australia, even though it could take some time for a decision. Wilson said he believed Australia had a “very good chance of success” in the barley, cotton and coal cases. The latter two products have reportedly faced disruptions because Chinese authorities issued verbal instructions to certain businesses last month to stop buying from Australia.
On the eve of the potential new trade bans, Austrade officials held a phone hook-up with farming and business representatives on Thursday, the contents of which were first reported by the Australian newspaper. “Quite frankly they didn’t tell us anything we didn’t know,” said a source from one of the affected sectors who was on the call. “They couldn’t confirm any facts [about the potential new trade disruptions]. They basically said the relationship with China is poor and it doesn’t look like any chance of that improving in the foreseeable future. “The main thing was you need to look to diversify your markets.” It is understood officials also urged exporters to ensure they complied with all labelling and other technical requirements because there was likely to be increased scrutiny at Chinese ports. While the message was consistent with the government’s previous public calls for trade diversification and warnings that the risk of doing business with China was increasing, it reflects heightened anxiety about how long the trade tensions may last. Describing the phone hook-up as routine, Birmingham said the government was talking to sectors that were “concerned, understandably, given the media speculating and the rumours circulating about their trade with China”. Birmingham said the government realised “that the best environment for our exporters to operate in is one in which they have the maximum number of choices available to them” so businesses had the opportunity “to pivot”. That was why, the trade minister stressed, the government had either signed or was pursuing trade agreements with Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, Mexico, Indonesia, the European Union and the United Kingdom, along with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Birmingham said it was “disappointing that Chinese authorities refuse to engage” in talks at a ministerial level but Australia “stands willing to have that type of mature, responsible dialogue”. “I note that Chinese authorities have given assurances, both publicly through their media spokespeople, and privately, that there is no concerted action of discrimination against Australia, and we want to make sure that they live up to those commitments.”
Guardian Australia understands while there has been no official confirmation of customs blockages in the targeted sectors, the uncertainty has already led some exporters to suspend or delay shipments. China’s foreign ministry rebuffed Birmingham’s call for clarity after the state-run Global Times appeared to confirm that China had “halted seven categories of Australian goods from the market” but did not provide any further details. The foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, offered a general comment on Thursday that any measures on foreign imports were “in line with Chinese laws and regulations and international customary practices”. “They protect the safety of consumers and the legitimate rights and interests of domestic industries, and are consistent with the free trade agreement between China and Australia,” Wang said.",,Foreign,Guardian,5

What we heard George Nixon has an offer that Upside readers cannot refuse. I can only describe it as a do-it-yourshelf library. George explains more here: It’s really good to see the government has allowed libraries to stay open during this second lockdown so people can access books not via Amazon, but for some people that still might not be an option after a decade of austerity and local authority funding cuts. Bookshops are also still closed. During the first lockdown I posted pictures of my bookshelves on Twitter and Facebook in case anyone was interested in borrowing any of them, as they don’t do much after I’ve finished reading them. I’ve reposted the original posts from March (I’ve also bought plenty more books since then naturally...) and wondered if you wouldn’t mind helping me get the word out please? They’re all free, I just split the cost of postage with people, and it’d be great to spread the word as far as possible

1701,Church leaders expect easing of English lockdown ban on communal worship,11/6/20,"Christian leaders have said they expect the government to ease its ban on communal worship during lockdown in England as pressure mounts over church services on Remembrance Sunday. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said on Friday that the ban on religious services would “probably change before too long”. He said the government had been “very good, they’re listening very carefully”, since faith leaders wrote to Boris Johnson this week challenging the ban. Welby told Good Morning Britain that churches were safe places in the Covid pandemic. “People are well spread out, they’re wearing masks, they’re all registered. They’re really sensible about it.” Congregations needed communal worship to “get the strength to serve and love their neighbours”, he said. Faith leaders were not looking for a “great big row” with the government but had said that “we disagree with you about the need to close churches. This is one of the things that holds people together. It gives them a real sense of purpose and changes the world. So, I think that’ll probably change before too long.”
On Thursday, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Catholic archbishop of Westminster, said he thought the policy on communal worship would change. The rule was “not supported by any scientific evidence and clearly shows a misunderstanding of the importance of religious faith”, he told BBC Radio 4. “I think it will be changed,” he said. “As soon as possible, I hope to see places of worship opened again [for public worship].” Under the lockdown regulations, places of worship may remain open for private prayer, support activities, such as food banks, and to stream services, but not for communal worship. The interfaith letter to Johnson was also signed by Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and Hindu leaders. Traditionally, Church of England parishes hold services on Remembrance Sunday, which falls this weekend, to commemorate British servicemen and women who died in the two world wars and other conflicts. Remembrance Sunday events held outdoors with social distancing in place will be permitted under the lockdown rules, but not church services. The government’s guidelines note that Remembrance Sunday services are traditionally part of communal worship, but state: “From 5 November, places of worship are not permitted to open for communal worship. Celebrants may, however, enter places of worship to broadcast services to their communities and will be able to incorporate Remembrance services as part of this when they do.” The C of E will broadcast a special online service for the nation at 9am on Sunday, in which the Act of Remembrance will be read and the Last Post played, followed by a two-minute silence and the sounding of the reveille. Among those criticising the government’s restrictions was the former Conservative defence secretary Michael Fallon, who told the Telegraph: “It seems ridiculous. We trusted veterans to put their lives on the line for the country, but we cannot trust them to stand 2 metres apart in church.” Alan West, a former first sea lord, said: “It is not beyond the wit of man to have them allowed into a church. I think this ban is extraordinary. It should be overturned. If you look at the average size of a church, there must be a way of letting veterans in with social distancing. It seems very silly to have them standing outside in the freezing cold. This puts them more at risk. They will die of pneumonia rather than Covid-19, and that doesn’t seem a very good way ahead at all.” The former prime minister Theresa May told the Commons on Wednesday: “It [the church ban] has unintended consequences. The Covid-secure Remembrance service in Worcester cathedral is now going to be turned into a pre-recorded online service. Surely those men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom deserve better than this?”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1702,Dogs in prams: Taiwan's falling birthrate sees pets outnumbering children,11/6/20,"In a quiet southern Taipei alleyway, an ageing golden retriever peers sleepily from a pram being pushed by his elderly owner. A few minutes later a stroller pushed along by a young woman rolls past, carrying a brindle-cross. That afternoon a puppy wearing a tuxedo and rainbow bowtie is wheeled through the heaving crowds of the Taipei Pride parade. Dogs in prams are a common sight in Taiwan’s capital, where the city’s metro system allows pets on board only if they are in contained carriers. But observers say the trend goes beyond the practical and reflects changing attitudes towards pet ownership and a growing propensity for “fur babies” amid a declining birthrate in Taiwan.
Taiwan’s birthrate is among the lowest in Asia, and is due to delayed marriages, analysts say. Having children outside of marriage is still socially unacceptable, and economic barriers to having children include minimal maternity leave entitlements. At the same time, pet ownership is skyrocketing. In September analysts estimated the number of Taiwanese pets had overtaken the number of children aged under 15. As a result the pet accessory retail market is booming, and was worth US$1.52bn a year in 2015, according to Taiwan’s pet expo. Market research firm Euromonitor International said it has continued to grow ever since. A spokeswoman for pet pram manufacturer, Ibiyaya, said sales had increased more than five-fold between 2002 and 2015, and it was still growing, with more suppliers coming on to the market. “The industry is getting more competitive while customers have more options when it comes to choosing the right pet stroller for their fur kids,” she said. Strollers, sunglasses, raincoats and even socks for dogs are also increasingly common. Wu Hung, the executive director of the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan (East), worries that the desire for these items stem from “an anthropocentric way of thinking about animals and treat them as accessories for human fulfilment, rather than focusing on the animal’s needs”. “This can lead to serious welfare problems when the best interests of the animal are overlooked.” Hung said it was “heartening” to see a growing number of positive interactions between humans and animals, and strollers were good for improving the life of old or disabled animals, and getting them through busy urban areas, but they still needed exercise.
In Da’an Forest Park, Syin and Han are wheeling their two dogs and cat to the vet. Syin says they usually walk the dogs around the park on leashes, but today they’re in a hurry. “They still get exercise. This is for convenience so you can take them on the subway and to restaurants.” Syin says they grew up with lots of animals around them, but she’s seen the rate of pet ownership grow, especially the younger generations. “The first thing that comes to mind, is we don’t want to have children,” says Syin, when asked why. “You spend more money, you have more responsibility. Even though we have to spend money and have responsibility for [our pets], but children are … I don’t know, I’m not a baby person,” she laughs. Tom Parker, a UK citizen, Taiwan resident and owner of a Boston Terrier named Bené, says his wife makes him shelter their dog under an umbrella when it rains, but if she’s not around the dog gets wet. “Dogs in Taiwan are pampered and well cared for, but can also be an accessory to show off, and the more portable the better,” he says.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1703,Dutch government pilots technology to cut e-bike road deaths,11/6/20,"Electric bike motors will be shut down when entering residential or built-up areas of Amsterdam, under a government-funded project to cut road deaths from the increasingly powerful vehicles. The digital technology, which has been successfully trialled on a 4km stretch of bike lanes at Schiphol airport, was funded by the Dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management. The not-for-profit Townmaking Institute behind the concept is working with e-bike manufacturers and government authorities with the expectation that the speed-cutting technology and new regulations could be rolled out by 2022. Sixty-five people died last year while riding e-bikes, which have an integrated electric motor to propel the wheels, up from 57 in 2018. The vast majority were men over the age of 65. The standard e-bike reaches speeds of 12mph (20km/h), but faster models, such as speed pedelecs, can reach 28mph. Indranil Bhattacharya, a technology strategist at the Townmaking Institute, said discussions had been opened with manufacturers about how their bikes would interact with digital infrastructure built by local authorities. He said: “When we first discussed the idea with manufacturers that you would cut off the power they said: ‘Well, we will put the intelligence in our own bikes, we don’t need the infrastructure telling us.’ “But I think we helped them to understand that where vehicles should go and how fast is not up to a private party, a business. In a functioning democracy, that is the job of citizens and of government.” Discussions over the use of the technology are most advanced with the municipality of Amsterdam, but the provinces of Gelderland and North Holland are also said to have shown an interest. “The whole narrative is about moving individuals from a self-centric mode,” Bhattacharya said. “You have been cycling through an empty stretch and you are mostly thinking of yourself and your experience, but now as you come into a built-up area it is about the collective good. By reducing the speed we are making it safer for everybody.”
The technology trialled at Schiphol offers policymakers a range of options. “Say the weather is really bad, there is a headwind of 40km and cyclists are at a standstill, then cutting off the power would be counterintuitive,” said Bhattacharya. “We built it so you can detect the direction the bike is going, and a policymaker can say: ‘We change the regulation. We won’t cut your power off because the weather is bad.’ The intelligent infrastructure would then tell the bicycle not to cut off the power.” The infrastructure could also inform an e-bike of upcoming obstacles or junctions, by alerting cyclists with a gentle vibration of the handlebars. Bhattacharya said: “It’s a bit like turning your mobile phone on. As you arrive, the [bike’s software] makes a session with the digital infrastructure. A digital twin will be aware of a bump coming up and send an alert. It will talk directly to the bicycle.” The Dutch ministry of infrastructure and water has provided €1.3m (£1.2m) of funding for the project, a sum matched by Schiphol, which wants to encourage its employees to cycle to work.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1704,Ethiopia's PM says airstrikes launched against targets in restive Tigray region,11/6/20,"Ethiopia’s air force has carried out strikes in the restive Tigray region, the country’s prime minister has said, in another escalation of a crisis that observers fear could plunge the country into a bitter and bloody civil conflict. The prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, said the strikes in multiple locations “completely destroyed rockets and other heavy weapons” belonging to the well-armed regional government and made it impossible for a retaliatory attack. There was no mention of casualties in what Abiy called the “first round of operation” against the region’s government, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front. He said the air force destroyed heavy weapons in Tigray’s capital, Mekele, and surrounding areas. The operation in the northernmost of the nine regions of Ethiopia will continue “until the junta is made accountable by law”, Abiy said. He asserted that the “large-scale law enforcement operation” has “clear, limited and achievable objectives: to restore the rule of law and the constitutional order”. The TPLF dominated Ethiopia’s government before Abiy took office in 2018, but its power has since waned. Abiy’s government launched military operations in Tigray on Wednesday, after he accused the TPLF of attacking a military camp in the region and attempting to loot military assets. The TPLF denies the attack and has accused Abiy of concocting the story to justify deploying the military. There was no immediate response from the government in Tigray to the announcement of airstrikes. The region is being increasingly boxed in by movement restrictions and a six-month state of emergency imposed by the federal government. Earlier in the day Abiy had threatened Tigray’s leaders, warning that there was “no place for criminal elements” in Ethiopia. “The proud Ethiopian people of Tigray [and] other citizens cannot be taken hostage by fugitives from justice forever. We shall extract these criminal elements [from Tigray and] relaunch our country on a path to sustainable prosperity for all,” last year’s Nobel peace prize winner said in a statement on social media.
“What has been initiated against us is clearly a war, an invasion … This is a war we’re conducting to preserve our existence,” Debretsion Gebremichael, chair of the TPLF and president of the Tigray region, said at a press conference.
Debretsion said fighting persisted in western Tigray and that federal troops were gathering on the border in the neighbouring Amhara and Afar regions. Diplomats in Addis Ababa said there have been casualties on both sides, but with internet and phone connections in Tigray cut there was no confirmation or details of the reports. The fighting in Tigray has drawn expressions of concern from the UN, US and EU. “The stability of Ethiopia is important for the entire Horn of Africa region. I call for an immediate de-escalation of tensions and a peaceful resolution to the dispute,” the UN secretary general, António Guterres, wrote on Twitter. Experts fear a protracted and disastrous conflict that could “seriously strain an Ethiopian state already buffeted by multiple grave political challenges, and send shockwaves into the Horn of Africa region and beyond”. “A war that many Ethiopians feared was possible but hoped would never happen appears to be under way … Unless urgently halted [it] will be devastating not just for the country but for the entire Horn of Africa,” the International Crisis Group said in a briefing on Thursday. Tigray’s people make up 5% of Ethiopia’s 109 million population, but the region is wealthier and more influential than many other, larger, regions. Under Abiy, Tigrayan leaders have complained of being unfairly targeted in corruption prosecutions, removed from top positions, and blamed for the country’s problems. One factor in the latest crisis is the postponement of national elections due to the Covid-19 pandemic. National polls were due to take place in August, but electoral officials ruled in March that all voting would be delayed until the threat from the virus had eased. When parliamentarians voted to extend officials’ mandates – which would have expired in early October – Tigrayan leaders went ahead with regional elections in September that Abiy’s government deemed illegal. Now each side sees the other as illegitimate, and federal lawmakers have ruled that Abiy’s government should cut off contact with, and funding to, Tigray’s leadership. The Tigray region is home to a large portion of the federal military personnel and the location of much of its equipment, a legacy of Ethiopia’s 1998-2000 border war with Eritrea, its northern neighbour. Some analysts estimate that Tigray could muster more than half of the armed forces’ total personnel and mechanised divisions, meaning that neither side could be confident of a swift victory. There are widespread fears that open conflict will inspire further secessionist sentiment in other parts of Ethiopia. “We’re working to ensure the war won’t come to the centre of the country. It will end there in Tigray,” said general Berhanu.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1705,Family mourning loss of three members to Covid targeted by social media trolls,11/6/20,"Bereaved relatives who lost three members of their family to Covid-19 in five days have been targeted by social media trolls claiming the virus is a hoax. Gladys Lewis, 74, from Pentre in south Wales, died at the Royal Glamorgan hospital on 29 October. Her son Dean Lewis, 44, was found unresponsive at his home in nearby Treorchy the next day and pronounced dead a short time later. His younger brother Darren, 42, died at the same hospital as his mother on Monday. All three had tested positive for coronavirus before they died and their death certificates state Covid-19 as the cause. After news of the family’s tragedy was published online, however, some social media users refused to accept they had died of coronavirus. There were also comments asking what underlying health conditions they had, and some suggested their diet and lifestyle had been a factor in their deaths. Dean’s wife, Claire Lewis, told Channel 4 News that people who think Covid is a conspiracy need to “wise up”. “The comments we have seen I try to blank out as much as possible because people are cruel,” she said. “There have been some amazing comments where people have given us support and even strangers have said how heartfelt they are. But for the people who are trolling, I just feel sorry for you because I hope it doesn’t happen to you.” David Lewis, Gladys’s husband of 44 years, echoed Claire’s comments. He urged people to “believe this is real” and said that “if they lose what we’ve lost, then they will suffer”. David described his wife as a wonderful woman who was a devoted mother, grandmother of 13 and great-grandmother of four. Asked about Dean and Darren, David said: “What can a father say when he’s lost two sons? I love them so much. It’s devastating. I don’t know how I’m going to get through it.” His daughter, Debbie Mountjoy, said the comments on social media broke their hearts: “I just hope none of them have to go through anything like what we and hundreds and thousands of other families have had to go through with Covid-19. “They want to spend a couple of minutes with me, my dad, Claire, Claire’s children and my children to see the devastation that we are going through as a family. Spend five minutes with us and they’ll know it’s real.” Debbie described Gladys as “the best mother and grandmother anyone could ask for”, and Claire said her husband had had a heart of gold and adored his family. Darren was “the most lovable, happy man”, the family said.
The family are unsure how their loved ones contracted coronavirus. Darren, who had Down’s syndrome, had not left his home since February except to attend hospital appointments. His mother, who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema, had also been shielding, and Dean only went out once a week to shop for his parents. Ten other members of the family, including Debbie, David and Claire, also tested positive for coronavirus and have been self-isolating. “We were scared of the virus anyway,” said Debbie. “But now we are absolutely terrified … I’m so scared because of losing the three of them that I’m going to lose my dad or somebody else.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1706,Home Office accused of breaching court order over asylum seeker evictions,11/6/20,"The Home Office has been accused of breaching a high court order that halts the eviction of asylum seekers during the pandemic lockdown, the Guardian has learned. During the first lockdown in March, the eviction of refused asylum seekers from Home Office accommodation was paused for public health reasons to protect asylum seekers and the general public from Covid-19. Asylum seekers who are made street homeless could be at risk of contracting and spreading coronavirus if left outside or sofa surfing, which would involve going from one household to another, which is banned during lockdown.
After the government’s lockdown announcement on Saturday, the Guardian asked the Home Office if it would pause evictions of asylum seekers once again. A government statement was provided on Tuesday, Home Office sources said, saying that while the policy was under review and would be determined by local circumstances, it was business as usual: those whose asylum claims had failed were expected to leave the country within 21 days and cessations of support had resumed in September. What the statement did not mention was that 24 hours earlier, on Monday, a high court judge, Mr Justice Fordham, had issued a court order instructing the Home Office to halt evictions because of public health concerns. The order was an interim measure until the matter could be more fully investigated at another court hearing. In his ruling, the judge said: “I have been given no reason and shown no reasoned document which addresses a basis for continuing with evictions in the circumstances. I cannot currently see a justification for continuing with evictions in the circumstances where the harm and risk cannot readily be reversed.” A Nigerian refused asylum seeker who received an eviction notice from the Home Office brought the case that resulted in the court order. But despite this order, the eviction process continued. On Tuesday, lawyers sought an urgent out-of-hours court hearing at 11.30pm to halt another threatened eviction that appeared to be going ahead despite the court order issued the previous day. The Guardian spoke to a 30-year-old woman from the Caribbean whose asylum claim based on gender identity was refused. The Home Office cut off her financial support on 19 October, and on Wednesday an official from the Home Office housing subcontractor Mears arrived at her door and handed her a pro forma eviction letter with the date she needed to leave the property – 11 November – handwritten into it. “I can see myself ending up on the streets,” she said. ”I have nowhere to go. My friends are asylum seekers and I’m not allowed to stay at their accommodation. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and have previously made two suicide attempts. I feel like an outcast.” The eviction letter seen by the Guardian states: “You need to leave this property by 11 November 2020. We understand it is a key step in your asylum journey.” The letter suggests contacting the Home Office contractor Migrant Help for post-eviction support. “I did that but all they could offer me was a list of food banks,” said the woman. Kathy Cosgrove, a solicitor at Greater Manchester Law Centre who secured the court order on behalf of the Nigerian asylum seeker, welcomed the order but expressed concern about the Home Office’s failure to commit to halting evictions. “The home secretary has failed to promise to cease evictions and protect not only former asylum seekers but the communities in which they live. The government claims to follow the science but appears to have not considered the public health impact of making hundreds of former asylum seekers destitute.” Anna Lewis, the chief executive of Open Door North East, which has been supporting asylum seekers issued with eviction notices, said: “Over the last seven weeks, the Home Office has sought to dehumanise these individuals further by seeking to remove food and shelter from those who do not agree to return to their country of origin – a process which has created intense anxiety among the people we serve. We have supported people who were told they had to leave their home on the day of the lockdown or in the next few days and we were unable to give them any certainty that they would be made safe.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are fixing our broken asylum system to make it firm and fair. We will seek to stop abuse of the system while ensuring it is compassionate towards those who need our help, welcoming people through safe and legal routes. “There is no court order stopping all cessations of asylum support, but an interim order to pause decisions on support for failed asylum seekers. We have instructed contractors to pause cases that were being implemented at the time that this order came into effect.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1707,"Hong Kong informers’ hotline receives 2,500 tip-offs within hours",11/6/20,"Hong Kong police claim they have received more than 2,500 tip-offs since the launch of a hotline for people to report suspected breaches of the city’s sweeping national security law. The multi-platform hotline, which opened on Thursday, allows Hong Kongers to report information directly to national security police via text message, email, or WeChat. A police spokesman told the Guardian that by Friday morning the force had received more than 2,500 pieces of information. The hotline can accept audio, videos, photographs and texts, and contributors will remain anonymous and receive no replies once they have submitted their tips, police said. While many countries have law enforcement tip lines, Hong Kong’s has been denounced by critics as reminiscent of China’s Cultural Revolution, when neighbours were encouraged to monitor and inform on each other. The broadly defined national security law, imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing in June, criminalises a wide range of acts on the grounds of subversion, secession, foreign collusion or terrorism. Speaking from Beijing, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, hailed the law as having been effective. “You don’t see major violent incidents any more. So in this sense, the law has been very effective in having a deterrent effect,” she said. At least 27 people have been arrested under the law, several of them twice, although only two have been charged. While authorities said it would only be used against a “small group” of criminals, it has resulted in the criminalisation of benign acts that support independence, and a chilling effect across media, academia and in schools. Amid the crackdown others have also been arrested using pre-existing laws, including seven pro-democracy legislators held on Sunday over alleged contempt offences and a pro-democracy activist accused of colonial-era secession crimes. Speaking outside of a court appearance on Friday, the legislators accused the government of seeking to suppress dissent inside parliament. On Tuesday, Choy Yuk-ling, a producer for a current affairs TV show, was arrested and charged over misusing a vehicle registration search function while investigating the involvement of gang members and police in the Yuen Long attack in July 2019. The resulting documentary, which aired last year, revealed police were present but took no action, her employer RTHK said. Lam declined to comment on the case but repeated that Hong Kong’s press freedom was protected as long as journalists did not break the law. A key criticism of the law has been that its dearth of specifics makes it difficult for journalists to know if they are breaking the law.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1708,How a full-scale lockdown rebellion by Tory MPs was called off,11/6/20,"Just a few hours ahead of Wednesday’s Commons vote to approve lockdown 2.0, a dozen sceptical Conservative MPs gathered in parliament’s grand committee room 14. Minds had not yet been made up. Little more than a year ago, Tory MPs filed into the same room to cast their ballots in the leadership race that propelled Boris Johnson to Downing Street. Now, his party was being asked to support ordering the public to “stay at home” for a second time and many were deeply uncomfortable. As the clock ticked down, eyes were glued to the laptop set up in front of them. Joined by nearly 20 more of their Conservative colleagues on a Zoom call, they grilled the Sage member Sir Jeremy Farrar as he made the case for the 28-day restrictions via video link. Edward Argar, a health minister, watched on virtually and closed proceedings. The leading lockdown critic and former Tory minister Steve Baker, who organised the hour-long morning meeting, said: “The scene really was members of parliament wrestling with an impossibly hard choice, with vast uncertainty on both sides of the question, really profound consequences and a sense of what the hell are they going to do? They had the best opportunity they were going to get to grill the best advocate of the government’s position.” Not everyone was convinced. “In some cases it was very successful, in some cases colleagues decided to prioritise other matters,” he added. Baker, who as the former ERG chairman is a battle-hardened leader of Brexit rebellions, said: “On this matter I took an early decision that it was not for me as an individual backbencher to be seeking to drive MPs to one side of the question or another. I felt that the proper thing for me to do as an organiser of my colleagues, the best service I could render them and the public, was to make the arguments available to them.” Wednesday morning’s Zoom call wasn’t the only attempt to sway wavering minds on the back benches. Elsewhere, some former cabinet ministers were offered a virtual chat with Michael Gove – but it was the 2019 “red wall” intake where the government really focused its efforts to contain a full-scale rebellion. Calls from Boris Johnson and prepared speeches given to MPs by the whips office appeared to quell any major outbreak of ill-discipline from newly elected troops. But the whipping operation was harder this time than the Brexit votes, because Downing Street cannot reach all the MPs who have concerns. One veteran MP said there was growing despair about Johnson’s ability to steer the country through the crisis. “Dominic Cummings is also part of that,” the MP said in reference to prime minister’s most senior adviser, who the Guardian exposed for travelling to Durham during the height of the first set of restrictions in March. “And he is the one who is most in favour of locking down and just letting the economy tank.” The anti-lockdown group is not tight, in the way that Brexit factions were co-ordinated. Some are from rural constituencies. Others are passionate libertarians and oppose lockdowns on a values basis. But it isn’t small. Baker runs a WhatsApp broadcast list – which allows users to send a message to several contacts at once – entitled “lockdown sceptics”, which has 95 Tory MPs on it receiving updates, although colleagues cannot see who else is on it or reply to other recipients.
“What really worries me is that so many people were apparently quite happy to vote to deprive people of basic liberties,” one MP said. “That is how dictatorship happens. Adolf Hitler went through a constitutional process.” One rebel MP said that whips had focused on the 2019 intake. “Lots of people that didn’t vote with us were bullied like mad yesterday, most of the young lot, new entrants, were given speeches by the whips and told their futures lay supporting the government,” the MP said. “Boris was determined. He was ringing everybody.” Another MP, who did not rebel, said: “A large number of Conservative MPs think we are going to have to learn to live with this virus. So the approach he’s taking is burning his political capital with a lot of backbenchers.” The government easily won Wednesday’s vote to impose new restrictions in England for 28 days, by a margin of 516 votes to 38, with Labour’s backing. Several of the 34 Tory MPs who rebelled told no one of their plans until theyvoted. “I didn’t talk to anybody else about this, apart from one neighbouring colleague ,” the MP said. “If you look at the list, there are some people who just don’t like Boris. That’s politics. But there were some who are traditionally much more loyal, who had to say, ‘No, I just can’t do this.’ ” One senior Conservative MP, who voted against the new lockdown on Wednesday, told the Guardian: “You had some pretty heavyweight MPs in the no lobby or among those who abstained. Looking at Theresa May, who is not an excitable individual, denouncing the quality of the data on which we’re being asked to make this decision, and saying it was dodgy data, I thought was a remarkable thing.”
Several discontented Tory MPs said that now the vote was over, the rebels could now coalesce around specific demands. “Every time we vote on measures, more and more reluctantly, there is constant failure and no strategy,” one normally loyal MP said. One persistent source of anger is a lack of access to data. Many complain that the data presented by Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance is questionable or out ofdate. “The government is almost creating a miasma of ignorance around what it’s doing,” said Chris Green, the MP for Bolton who resigned as a PPS over the local lockdown in his town. “People want answers, they’re not getting them, and therefore people reject what the government is saying. Therefore, compliance with edicts will go down.” David Jones, the former Brexit minister, added: “The evidence that has been produced is obsolete and therefore unreliable. I could not in good conscience vote to deprive so many of my fellow citizens of their essential freedoms on the basis of such unreliable evidence.” Others say they believe their local authorities are coping perfectly well with coronavirus and cannot see the logic of imposing a lockdown on already struggling businesses. Jonathan Djanogly, the MP for Huntington, said: “In my local area, the head of the health service, the council, the MPs, the police, everyone gets together once a week and it’s amazingly cohesive, decisions are made within three hours when they could have taken three months before. It is incredibly impressive – they have managed the situation.” He said he had been asked to support a lockdown without being given any data on the costs it would have. A number of MPs said they expected ministers to try to extend lockdown on 2 December, and that if this happened, the government would need Labour votes for it to pass. One predicted up to 100 Conservative MPs would refuse to back another lockdown extension. One senior MP said, “My reading of the temperature is that the centre of gravity – given that lots of people are very concerned about being portrayed as not caring about their local hospital being overwhelmed or their ICU not being able to cope – is very much ‘thus far but no further’. ” That warning was echoed by Baker. “We have to come out of this with a clear strategy for living with the virus and we never lock down again,” he said.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1709,How UK government misrepresented Covid projections – explained,11/6/20,"The UK Statistics Authority has rebuked the government over its lack of transparency around projected Covid-19 deaths and hospital admissions, saying it could cast doubt over official figures. A range of estimates were used to make the case for a second English lockdown in a press conference on 31 October. However, the UKSA said “the data and assumptions for this model had not been shared transparently”, potentially undermining confidence in official figures.
On Friday, Downing Street acknowledged there had been an “error” in the way the data was presented but said the underlying analysis was unchanged. A No 10 spokesman said: “We want to make the data as clear and transparent as we can. There was no error in the underlying analysis. The consensus is that without action we will breach the first wave [peak] in terms of hospital admissions. “We have acknowledged the mistake which we have corrected and we will continue to try and provide data in the clearest possible way.” The upper limit of these projections has now been revised down. How much does this change our understanding of the second wave? What was misrepresented in the data and how much have the projections changed? At the press conference, the government showed a chart that projected daily coronavirus deaths could surpass the first wave peak and hit 1,500 deaths a day by December. The figures were based on data available up to 28 October and produced by academic modelling teams. The upper limit of this projection has since been revised down to 1,000 deaths a day, which would be in line with the first wave peak. However, the central projection remains the same in the new version, which predicts that there could be about 800 deaths a day by December.
The upper limit for projected hospital admissions has also been revised down, from about 9,000 to 6,000 a day. Again, the central projection has not changed, and remains at more than 4,000 admissions a day by December. How does this change our understanding of deaths and hospital admissions? The latest modelling shows the second wave peak could be less severe than initially predicted, but the models are updated regularly and this could change again in coming weeks. Dr Duncan Robertson, a policy and strategy analytics academic at Loughborough University, said: “The central projection remains the same: all that’s changed is what are called the ‘prediction intervals’ [the upper and lower limits of the range where the prediction might fall]. Hospitals are still going to be overrun if we don’t do something now, and adjusting the prediction intervals on the graph is not going to change that.
“The government needs to be proactive in its decision making rather than reacting when it’s too late. Scientific advice shows a projection of what could come and it’s important that policymakers put mitigation measures in place so that they are ahead of the epidemic rather than being controlled by it.” What else has been wrong with data during the pandemic? The inaccuracy is the latest in a long line of problems with government Covid-19 data, which has cast a shadow over how the pandemic has been managed and communicated. Many of the issues have revolved around testing and how the number of tests being carried out have been counted. In May and June the agency reprimanded the government on its testing statistics twice. Rather than show the number of tests that had been carried out, the government included mailed-out tests in an effort to hit its target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of May.
In a letter at the time to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the head of the UKSA, Sir David Norgrove, said: “The aim seems to be to show the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding.” The number of tests available has also been in doubt after 1.3m inaccurate tests were quietly pulled from the government’s tally and it changed how it counted available tests in August. There have also been concerns about the accuracy of death figures. In July, Hancock announced an urgent government review into how deaths were counted by Public Health England after it was revealed that people were included in Covid death counts even if they had recovered from the virus months earlier. However, analysis showed the likely overcount of deaths at the time was minimal.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1710,Japan to help cover IVF costs in attempt to avert demographic crisis,11/6/20,"Japan’s new prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, has given hope to couples struggling to conceive with a pledge to cover expensive fertility treatments with health insurance, but experts warn the change will do little to avert a demographic crisis. Suga, who took office in September, identified depopulation as a major challenge for Japan during his campaign to succeed Shinzo Abe as PM and repeated his determination to tackle the low birth rate during his first policy speech in parliament. “To support households that want to have children we will make infertility treatment applicable to insurance,” he said. Infertility is not officially recognised as a disease in Japan and so treatment has been available only privately. Couples pay several hundred thousand yen – equivalent to thousands of dollars – for a single treatment, with a significant number paying millions of yen over several years for multiple IVF cycles. With health insurance they would pay 30% of all costs. Despite a series of government initiatives to encourage couples to have bigger families, Japan’s birth rate remains stubbornly low. The number of newborns fell below 1 million for the first time in 2016 and to a record low of 865,000 in 2019. Experts predict this year’s total will be even lower. In response Suga wants to bring in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and other fertility treatments into the national health insurance system, possibly in 2022, and to increase subsidies in the meantime. Japan’s fertility rate – the average number of children a woman has during her lifetime – stood at 1.36 last year, well below the 2.1 needed to keep the population stable. The government aims to raise the rate to 1.8 and has identified cheaper access to IVF as a potential solution.
But if the trend continues Japan’s population, currently at 126 million, is forecast to fall below 100 million in 2053, and to just over 88 million in 2065, when more than 38% of the population will be aged 65 or over, according to a study by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research. Local authorities offer reimbursements of up to ¥1.05m to couples with a combined income of less than ¥7.3m a year although few stay with the process long enough to receive the full amount. In addition many of the couples seeking treatment are in their late 30s and exceed the income threshold. Despite the cost and disruption of regular clinic visits, fertility treatment has become a popular option for the growing number of women who choose to marry and have children later in life since Japan registered its first birth via IVF in 1983. In 2018 a record 57,000 babies – or one in 16 – were born using the process. Osamu Ishihara, a professor in the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at Saitama Medical University, welcomed Suga’s plan but doubted it would have much impact. “I’m afraid I don’t think it will work,” he said, citing South Korea where the birth rate has continued to fall to record lows since more infertility treatments were covered by national health insurance in 2017. “There is no simple explanation for the low birth rate … it’s a combination of complex issues in Japanese society.” Experts say the change will do little to address the low birth rate unless it is accompanied by a cultural shift that makes it easier for women to combine work and family life, and for working men to spend more time at home helping to raise their children. “Covering fertility treatment with health insurance will help a little, but that alone will not be enough to lift the birth rate,” said Ishihara, adding that gender inequality was also a factor in the availability of sexual health services. “Treatments for men are quickly introduced but women are at a huge disadvantage. In the UK treatments for all aspects of women’s reproductive health are available for free on the NHS, but in Japan they have to pay for everything from contraception to abortion.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1711,Johnson and EU commission chief to hold talks before decisive week for Brexit deal,11/6/20,"Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will hold talks on Saturday before a potentially decisive week in the Brexit negotiations, amid growing concern in Brussels at the lack of progress. UK sources played down expectations of a breakthrough moment but with time short for parliamentary ratification the phonecall may prove to be the final chance for a political intervention in the troubled talks. “The prime minister will speak to [Von der Leyen] tomorrow afternoon to take stock of the UK-EU negotiations,” a Downing Street spokesman said. Johnson said he hoped a trade deal with the EU could be agreed, but the UK was well prepared if final-stage talks failed. “I very much hope that we will [get a deal], and obviously that depends on our friends and partners across the Channel. I think there is a deal to be done if they want to do it. If not, the country is of course very, very well prepared and as I have said before, we can do very, very well on Australian terms.” Claims that Joe Biden’s expected victory in the US presidential election had provoked the meeting were dismissed by EU and British sources as “far fetched”. Sources said the call was scheduled before election night and that uncertainty over the potential for a trade deal with the new US administration was having little or no impact on the talks. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, returns to London for the trade and security negotiations on Sunday. EU diplomats representing the 27 member states were told by the European commission on Friday that the next “major moment” would come at the end of next week, on Barnier’s return. The outstanding issues remain the level of access to UK waters provided to EU fishing fleets, fair competition rules for business – including rules on domestic subsidies – and the mechanism in the final treaty for resolving future disputes. EU officials close to the negotiations bemoaned a particular absence of progress on the so-called level playing field provisions to ensure neither side can deregulate to gain an advantage or unfairly subsidise businesses. There remains a lack of accord on how prohibitive the rules on domestic subsidies should be in the future treaty. Barnier told EU diplomats this week that the two sides were also struggling to agree a “credible mechanism” to ensure that social, environmental and labour standards on both sides develop in parallel. “We are nowhere,” said one source. The UK has agreed to non-regression from the current level but is resisting provisions that would tie the UK to Brussels’ rulebook in perpetuity. “Ideology is difficult to overcome,” said a source. EU sources said they hoped that the UK government’s refusal to budge was “brinkmanship” and “posturing” but they feared the two sides were doomed to run out of time, with neither willing to budge. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, has been pushing for a “final arbitration” meeting between Johnson and Von der Leyen, to Barnier’s frustration. Barnier told diplomats this week the gap between the two sides remained too wide on too many issues for such a moment to deliver a solution. He told MEPs in a meeting on Wednesday that “next week is really the last chance for the British to move”. One EU official said Johnson had not shown “any grasp of the detail”. Should a deal be possible, it is hoped the 27 EU leaders will be able to sign it off at an upcoming conference call on 19 November or at a similar summit expected to be arranged soon after. Sources suggested agreement needed to be found by 12 or 13 November to allow the European parliament to start its ratification process.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1712,Macron's task is to show French Muslims they have a place in the republic | Catherine Fieschi,11/6/20,"As a dual citizen of France and Canada, I never cease to be amazed by the depth of misunderstanding there is about French attitudes to religion. France’s shortcomings in its management of diversity are obvious – as are everyone else’s – but it is important to recognise some basic facts before pronouncing on them. The first is that the principle of laïcité in France – the country’s particular brand of secularism – is more than posturing: it is a lived, sociological fact. The extent of secularism in France, especially over the last half century, is well documented. Jérôme Fourquet, in The French Archipelago, provides 350 pages of evidence on the transformation of France – or, as he puts it, the disappearance of the religious in France. To explain the depth of that transformation, he starts with the obliteration of Catholicism. There hasn’t just been a precipitous decline in Catholic belief and practice, but a near-vanishing of Christian references. In 1945, Catholicism had officially been a minority sport for half a century, but it still played a role in the social space. The years since the war have seen that role disappear, and Catholic observance reduced to a (very small) minority. As a result that minority has occasionally become more strident, more “identitarian”, but also quite irrelevant. Its irrelevance is confirmed by Olivier Roy in Is Europe Christian?, in which he examines the political space occupied by French Catholics. As Roy puts it, no political party in France can afford to put Catholicism at the heart of its political programme – or in fact go anywhere near it, because it speaks to only roughly 5% of the electorate. And switches everyone else radically off. And this is the key point: France is a nation of equal-opportunity heretics. The allergy to granting faith any kind of public role is displayed across the board: most French people will break out in hives at the sight of a procession of priests in the public space, as much as at any other kind of religious display. Any debate about the rights or wrongs of France’s brand of secularism needs to be conducted within the terms of this generalised anti-clericalism. Of course, there is a difference between poking fun at a majority culture that is largely confident in itself and its own contradictions, and poking fun at a culturally and economically marginalised minority. There is Islamophobia in France, much as in any non-Muslim majority country, but reducing the principle of laïcité to intolerance or racism – or alleging that it is no more than a vast cover-up – is missing how deep and how wide French suspicion of all faiths runs. So while this across-the-board anti-clericalism may exacerbate social tensions, it is politically defensible and institutionally rooted. Anyone holding their breath for an about-turn on this is in for a long wait. Most French people would go to the wall for it, including against any Christian church. And those who are looking for France to compromise here misunderstand the nature of what citizenship means in France: any compromise with any faith will be seen as a breach of the social contract. That is the second basic fact. However, for the contract to hold, it needs to be renewed with French citizens of all beliefs and of all cultures. And for that to work secularism cannot be deployed simply as an incantation of republican values or used as a test of belonging. Laïcité needs to be explained. For many (especially young) Muslims it simply isn’t clear how or why this particular ideal can be liberating rather than diminishing: that it offers a neutral space in which to exercise one’s fundamental human rights, including the right to walk away from one’s original tradition or belief. Taking the trouble to spell this out (it hasn’t been done since the 1905 law separating church and state) is a necessary step. And it is a remarkably difficult one. The renewed emphasis that the French government is hopefully now going to place on the teaching of laïcité – rather than simply beating people over the head with it – gives me hope. But this takes us to the third basic fact and the recent actions of Emmanuel Macron, which mark a departure from those of his predecessors. Over the past few weeks, Macron has been taken to task for calling for a reformed Islam, and a French Islam. I think his recent actions show two things. The first is a resoluteness in engaging with Muslim media and Muslim organisations abroad. He has made it clear, for example, that he supports the inclusion of Hezbollah in talks on the future of Lebanon. Domestic engagement with French Muslim organisations may alienate some, given that these groups do not represent all French Muslims. But the fact that they are so actively being brought into the tent suggests a pivotal moment. Macron is upping the security ante, too, adapting the counter-terrorism strategy France first put in place in the aftermath of 9/11 and developed after the attacks of 2015. And of course this is part of his attempt to square up to Marine Le Pen and her supporters. But the president may also quietly be setting the stage for a new departure; closer to a strategy of multiculturalism, even if that concept is so fundamentally misunderstood in France that it could never dare speak its name.
I have always argued that multiculturalism, as practised in Canada or Singapore rather than Germany or the UK, is a stroke of realpolitik genius. Far from the kumbaya philosophy to which it is often reduced, multiculturalism is first and foremost an incredibly effective if slightly cynical political strategy. It is designed to create a framework for the participation of minorities – complete with all the right financial and political incentives – in exchange for an agreement that each of them becomes just one defined cultural strand among many. Faith and religion become culture, as do language and ethnicity. Institutions make room for their representation, but as criss-crossing cultural identities rather than currents of belief or faith. Multiculturalism in effect dilutes public faith into culture. This may not sit well with everyone, but it does recognise and cement people’s status in a polity. In the French context, where faith is a private matter but religion can be a matter of cultural affiliation, moving toward such inclusion is more necessary than ever. More to the point, it is probably the only compromise on the horizon. In advanced democracies with generous welfare states, where the state rather than the market is the gatekeeper to full citizenship rights, a multicultural set of institutions is the only way to balance rights and duties. What Macron is attempting to do – the carrot of engagement and the stick of security – may not immediately quell the sort of violence we have seen in the past few weeks, but it may create the kind of framework in which French Muslims will finally feel an integral part of the republic. Perhaps Macron has understood that a subtle dose of stealth multiculturalism is the best way to achieve thoroughly republican aims. • Catherine Fieschi is the director of Counterpoint and author of Populocracy",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1713,Mink and coronavirus: what's happened and should we be worried?,11/6/20,"News that the coronavirus has crossed from humans into mink, mutated and then jumped back again has generated understandable concern. Officially, 12 people have been infected at farms so far, mostly in northern Denmark, but the Danish health minister has admitted that up to half of the 783 human Covid cases in the region may be mink-related. This implies that the mutated virus is spreading from person to person, but how worried should we be?
Is it normal for viruses to mutate in this way? Viruses continuously accrue mutations as they replicate and circulate in populations, but most are harmless. Only a handful will change a virus’s ability to infect people or cause more serious disease. “Sars-CoV-2 is not mutating as fast as other related viruses, but because it has been circulating in the human population for some time now, there’s quite a large set of mutations that have emerged,” said Prof David Robertson, a virologist at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research.
These do not appear to have made it any more dangerous so far, but if a virus jumps into a different species the pressure on it to adapt increases. So its transmission to mink and back to humans has prompted some legitimate concern particularly as some of the mutations are linked to a potential ability to evade the immune system. What do we know about the coronavirus’s mutations? Seven mutations have been identified so far, all of them in the “spike protein” on the virus’s surface, which it uses to gain entry to cells. One, called Y453F, was previously identified in an outbreak of Sars-CoV-2 on a mink farm in the Netherlands in April. It too was transmitted to humans, but it does not appear to have spread. “I think it’s more about being aware that the virus can enter animal populations and exit back into humans,” said Julian Hiscox, the head of infection and global health at the University of Liverpool. “The more genetic diversity in the virus there is, the more evolutionary room it’s got to play with. One of the reasons to try and keep the number of cases down as low as possible [in humans and animals], is to reduce the genetic diversity of the virus.” Should we be worried? There are reports that virus particles with one of these mutations are less well neutralised by antibodies in people who have had Covid-19. This could in theory render a vaccine less effective, particularly because many of the vaccines under development target the spike protein. ”The true implication of the changes in the spike protein have not yet been evaluated by the international scientific community and are thus unclear,” said Prof James Wood, the head of the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge. “It is too early to say that the change will cause either vaccines or immunity to fail.”
It is also relatively easy to tweak vaccines. This happens each year with the influenza vaccine. So although we shouldn’t necessarily be terrified that this mutation has occurred, scientists should keep a close eye on it. Coronavirus cleary has the ability to jump from humans to animals and back again, and it seems to be quite good at it. Do the mink really need to be culled? It’s probably a wise precaution. “Culling mink may well not in itself cause the strain to disappear, but it may stop further mutant strains from developing in that species,” Wood said.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1714,"Myanmar minorities, including Rohingya, excluded from voting in election",11/6/20,"Myanmar is preparing to go to the polls for the country’s second general election since the end of full military rule, a vote that is expected to return Aung San Suu Kyi to power, but will exclude about 2.6 million ethnic-minority voters. While Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy rose to victory on a wave of optimism in 2015, this year’s elections are overshadowed by the coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis and intense conflict in parts of the country – where the military has been accused of atrocities reminiscent of those inflicted on Rohingya in 2017. It is widely expected that the NLD will retain power, thanks to the popularity of its leader. Many in the Bamar majority revere her as the mother of the nation, her popularity boosted further by her decision to travel to The Hague last year and defend Myanmar against allegations of genocide. There is, however, growing apathy, and deep resentment among ethnic minorities. An estimated 1.5 million voters from ethnic minorities in conflict-affected areas will not be allowed to participate in the election, ostensibly because of security concerns. Among them are many Rakhine Buddhists in Rakhine state, who were able to vote in 2015, but are now disenfranchised. In addition, about 1.1 million Rohingya, who have long been denied citizenship and voting rights, will be excluded. Human Rights Watch has expressed concern over such restrictions and described the election as “fundamentally flawed”. The decision to stop voting for many communities in conflict-stricken areas is likely to fuel already intense clashes. According to David Mathieson, an independent analyst, it handed a propaganda coup to the Arakan Army, which is fighting one of the country’s most lethal insurgencies in Rakhine state. “[They will say] we told you that you cannot trust the political system, we told you not to trust the government and the military. The only way to get her attention is to fight,” he said. Voting had been cancelled even in areas where fighting was limited, Mathieson added. About 38 million people will be eligible to go to the polls, including 5 million young, first-time voters, while 90 parties will compete with the NLD. Under the constitution, a quarter of parliamentary seats are reserved for the military. This week the army chief asserted his power in a rare interview, accusing the civilian government of “unacceptable mistakes” in the run-up to the election. The commander-in-chief, Min Aung Hlaing, described the military as the “guardian” of the country. Voter turnout is expected to be lower than in 2015, partly because of increased apathy. One fringe group, All Burma Federation of Students Unions, has called for a boycott, accusing the government of failing to deliver democratic reforms. Some of its members face up to five years in prison for their involvement in anti-government protests, while dozens are in hiding, according to reports by Reuters news agency. Fears over coronavirus may also deter some people from going to the polls. Aung San Suu Kyi decided to push ahead with an election despite a rise in cases in August. “A lot of people including myself would have liked her to postpone the elections for just a month,” said Khin Zaw Win, the director of Tampadipa Institute in Yangon. Restrictions imposed to curb the outbreak have made it harder for smaller, ethnic-based parties, which lack access to state-based media, to carry out campaigning. Despite this, Gar, a 30-year-old voter who did not want to give her full name, believes more people will turn towards ethnic-based parties, and dent the NLD’s majority. “I am excited that this 2020 election will show that people believe in more than just one political party,” she said. The country faces many challenges, Gar said, adding: “Civil wars in northern Myanmar, war crimes, International Court of Justice cases [where Myanmar is accused of genocide against Rohingya Muslims] and media freedom. “I don’t feel optimistic seeing how these cases are not handled properly. What kind of person can feel optimistic knowing all these are messed up?” Moe Thuzar, the coordinator of the Myanmar studies programme at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the vote was an important moment in the transition from strict military rule. She added: “Despite the flaws, the 2020 elections in Myanmar are still a milestone in the democratisation effort.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1715,New Zealand narrowly votes no to legalising cannabis in referendum,11/6/20,"New Zealanders have voted not to legalise cannabis in a referendum that painted a portrait of a country starkly divided over drug policy. The yes vote for legalising cannabis finished with 48.4% of the vote, trailing the no vote on 50.7% – or just 67,662 votes out of 2.9m. In the lead-up to the October election polls showed a country divided, with support for legalising cannabis ranging between 30-50%. In the non-binding referendum, voters were asked to decide whether they wanted to pass a bill that would legalise cannabis and regulate how it is used and sold. This would have included producing and selling fresh and dried cannabis, including plants and seeds – for people over 20 years old. The change would also have imposed more stringent restrictions than the rules around sales of alcohol and tobacco. Andrew Geddis, a law professor at the University of Otago, said while there was no legal imperative for an incoming government to abide by the referendum result, it would be “pretty hard for them not to act” on the vote. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has repeatedly refused to state her position on cannabis but said she would let the public know how she had voted once the results were released. Ardern recently said she has used cannabis “a very long time ago”. Former Labour prime minister, Helen Clark, said cannabis prohibition “doesn’t work” and should be abandoned, a position echoed by many leading public health professionals. “Clearly, the prospect of invoking criminal sanctions has had little impact on people’s behaviour,” Clark wrote in a recent opinion piece for the Guardian. “Evidence from longitudinal studies carried out in New Zealand indicates that by the age of 25, 80% of New Zealanders will have tried cannabis at least once. Put simply, prohibition-based policy approaches have not eradicated and will not eradicate cannabis consumption and supply in New Zealand or anywhere else where its use is established.” Cannabis is New Zealand’s most commonly used illicit drug, and the latest New Zealand Health Survey found that 15%, or 590,000 New Zealand adults used cannabis in the past 12 months. Māori account for 16% of New Zealand’s population and are shown to be disproportionately affected by New Zealand’s drug laws, facing three times as many arrests and prosecutions for possession of cannabis than non-Māori. Prof Papaarangi Reid, the head of the department of Māori health at the University of Auckland, has argued that legalisation would help control the potency of the drug, its price and make it less accessible to young people. “We’re particularly concerned that Māori have borne the brunt of biased enforcement and the negative health effects of illegal cannabis,” said Reid.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1716,Record weekly Covid cases in England but new infections 'stabilise',11/6/20,"Almost 620,000 people in England had coronavirus in the past week, according to the latest official estimates, but the rate of infection is slowing. The Office for National Statistics estimates that 618,700 people in England were infected with the virus in the week to 31 October – one in 90 people, the highest rate measured by the infection survey to date. This is a 9% rise on the 570,000 people estimated to have had the virus in the previous week. This is a slower increase than in previous weeks – the weekly rise stood at 31% the previous week and was as high as 92% a month ago.
However, there were still an estimated 45,700 new Covid cases a day in private households in England in the week covered by the analysis, albeit down from 51,900 a week earlier. This, according to the ONS, indicates that the rate of new infections “appears to have stabilised in recent weeks at around 50,000 new infections per day”. As in previous weeks, the highest Covid-19 infection rates are still being seen in the north-west and Yorkshire and the Humber. Every region other than the north-east witnessed increased levels of infection. Estimates for Wales put the number of infected people at 27,100 in the week to 31 October, or one in 110 people. A similar ratio is evident in Scotland, where the average number of people with Covid in the past two weeks is estimated at 47,300. Northern Ireland remains the most affected country, with 24,900 people estimated to have had Covid in the week to 31 October, equating to 1 in 75 people. Prof James Naismith, of the University of Oxford and director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, said the slowing of new cases was “welcome news” and this latest survey, alongside other data, indicated that the virus is spreading “at a constant rather than an increasing rate”. “This is evidence that the social restrictions prior to lockdown have had a real impact,” he said. However, he cautioned that, even if next week’s survey continues with a pattern of stabilisation or reduction, the UK was “still very likely to face daily death tolls of 500 a day for a period in November”. Dr Jonathan Pearson-Stuttard, of the school of public health in Imperial College London, said that while the figures were “clearly welcome”, there are “still a very high number of new cases each day – far higher than can be expected to be managed effectively by the current test-and-trace programme”. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said this and other data sources “suggest that there has been a decline in the spread of the epidemic over the past week or so”. However, he cautioned: “Whether this turns out to be a temporary decline or a longer-term trend, possibly as a result of the imposition of the three-tier system, it is too early to say.” Some 61,498 deaths have been registered by the UK’s three statistical agencies to date where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. More up-to-date government figures add 2,442 deaths to the total in England, 163 in Wales, 43 in Northern Ireland and 24 in Scotland. This brings to 64,170 the total number of deaths involving Covid-19 recorded in the UK to date.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1717,"Sunny Duong, accused of having links to Beijing, vows to fight foreign interference charge",11/6/20,"A Chinese-Australian community figure charged with a foreign interference offence has vowed to fight the charge and issued a spirited defence of his reputation, saying he has “nothing to hide”. Di Sanh Duong, who uses the name Sunny, told Guardian Australia he has been accused of working on behalf of the Chinese Communist party – allegations he rejects. “I’m a very popular person, I hold a lot of positions and I have nothing to hide. I will fight them in court,” he said. “I’ve been here 42 years ... I didn’t [ever] live in China.”
Duong appeared before the Melbourne magistrates court on Thursday charged with preparing for a foreign interference offence. It was the first time someone has been charged with the offence since new national security laws were passed in 2018. The 65-year-old is on bail and spoke to Guardian Australia from his Surrey Hills home in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs. Duong would not answer questions about the specifics of the charge, which came after a year-long investigation undertaken by the counter foreign interference taskforce led by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in collaboration with the Australian federal police. The AFP said in a statement that the charge related to a relationship with a foreign intelligence agency, and that action had been taken at an early stage to disrupt the alleged foreign interference, but did not release further detail. Duong, who also uses the name Yang Yisheng, will appear in court again in March. He is the owner of Stone Construction Australia, which specialises in manufacturing memorials at sites in Sunshine North and Clayton South. His wife also works at the business, and the couple have a young son. Duong had previously been a long-time employee of Nelson Bros funeral services, specialising in working with families from a Chinese or Vietnamese background. But he is also well-known for ties to the Liberal party, which he ran for in the then-state seat of Richmond in 1996. He is reportedly still a member of the party. In his role as president of the Oceania Federation of Chinese Organisations from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, he appeared with Alan Tudge, the acting minister for immigration and multicultural affairs, at Royal Melbourne hospital to donate $37,000 in June. Duong said in a statement at the time: “Most members of the Indo-China ethnic Chinese community have settled in Australia for over 40 years. We consider Australia our home and wish to do our part when Australia is in need.” Duong also claimed the association had raised almost $200,000 for bushfire relief. In 2014, Duong travelled to Taiwan representing the association and met senior government officials, according to photos from the meeting which were posted online. He was also invited to attend the China-Northeast Asia Expo in Changchun in 2017, but it is unclear if he made the journey. Earlier this year, he was one of a select group of community members invited to speak to the Chinese consul general in Melbourne via Zoom.
Under Duong’s leadership, the association has also signed petitions and protested in relation to conflicts involving the South China Sea and the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands dispute, taking positions which aligned with the CCP. He is also a director of the Museum of Chinese Australian History, the vice-president of the Victorian Chinese Memorial Foundation, which funds memorials for Chinese migrants who died during the gold rush, and an honorary adviser of the Springvale Asian Business Association. The association’s president, Daniel Cheng, said he had known Duong for more than a decade. The association regularly attracts local, state and federal politicians to its events, but Cheng said he had seen no indication Duong used these occasions to improperly build relationships with these guests. He also denied that Duong was a significant financial contributor to the association, but said he would regularly buy tickets or occasionally donate $50 to $100.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1718,Trail blazer: Nanaia Mahuta vows to transform New Zealand diplomacy,11/6/20,"When Jacinda Ardern appointed the veteran politician Nanaia Mahuta as New Zealand’s foreign minister, many seasoned political watchers were taken by surprise – as was Mahuta herself. “When she put the opportunity to me, I was really, really pleased with the offer; I didn’t hesitate,” Mahuta says. “It’s one of the portfolios where you’d love to make a contribution but it’s highly contested, so it was on my long list,” she says. “But I was on her short list.” The national broadcaster, Radio New Zealand, called Mahuta’s appointment “one of the biggest surprises of the cabinet reshuffle”, while the country’s largest newspaper company, Stuff, described it as a “surprise appointment” which sends a “great message”. At Asia Pacific Report, the decision was “a bolt out of the blue”. The former Labour leader David Cunliffe worked alongside Mahuta for almost 20 years. He says she has a rare record of honesty, and has studiously avoided the ego-driven politicking of the Beehive, as New Zealand’s parliament is known.
“I think it was an inspired choice, I have worked closely with Nanaia over the years and I think she is a person of good judgment, hard work and great strength,” Cunliffe says. “She is deeply rooted in very positive, humane values, so I think she will bring that perspective to international relations. By her own whakapapa (ancestry) she is of royal lineage within the Māori world and that will help her take a long-term perspective. She’s very grounded in who she is and she’s very strong.” Trail blazer Mahuta, 50, has been in parliament for 24 years. She has held portfolios including trade, customs, Māori affairs and youth development. Despite her long service and diverse experience, Mahuta has kept a low-profile, avoiding the limelight and dodging any association with scandal or gossip: “I’ve learnt what to worry about and what not to worry about – I don’t want to be distracted,” she says.
Nevertheless, she has set a series of firsts. In 2016 she became the first woman to display a moko kauae (sacred facial tattoo) in parliament. Now she becomes New Zealand’s first female foreign minister, and only the second Māori person in the role. “It’s satisfying to be given the opportunity to serve in a way we can lift the glass ceiling, in offices that have often not been open to women,” Mahuta says. “And importantly blaze a trail that can be different and unique, and carve out a real sense of opportunity as a country, but also for Indigenous people ... So that’s what I am going to do.” Her tribe, Waikato-Tainui, says she “brings tremendous mana [power] and skills” to her new role. “Nanaia has the negotiation and diplomacy skills to represent Aotearoa on the global stage. She also brings a unique cultural perspective that’s especially relevant in these times of great geopolitical uncertainty,” a tribe spokesperson said in a statement. It is this very uncertainty that influenced Ardern’s choice, Mahuta says. “She, we, have acknowledged that these are really challenging and uncertain times with the global pandemic but also ways in which countries are responding and the impact on economies,” she says, citing the climate emergency, growing inequality, and loss of trust in democratic institutions and multinationals as pressing concerns.
“We are navigating unprecedented times. We’re realistic about the size of our country and the level of our influence, but we have always maintained our ability to take a values-based approach following the leadership of … Ardern.” These values include manaakitanga (looking after people), collaboration, kaitiakitanga (guardianship of the environment) and relationship-building. “We will not be deterred by some of those big challenging issues like climate change, we will actually lean into that space. And do our bit to ensure that we can lead on some really difficult fronts and build a coalition of the willing.” Family diplomacy
Mahuta has two children, aged 10 and 7, as well as a third “spirit” [lost] child. She says her background as “a mother, as a daughter, a sister, a woman” gives her an intergenerational grounding, which emphasises the importance of building strong relationships and community. “Very early on in life I gained the skills of diplomacy primarily through my upbringing and the range of experiences I was exposed to, but most importantly understanding who I am as a Māori woman. “Once you understand who you are, you are less intimidated by other people from other backgrounds and beliefs. And so you navigate your way through to ensure you’re trying to achieve an outcome in a way that recognises diversity is not a threat. And that if you want to build a more sustainable future or outcome you have to build consensus. I learnt those skills from a young age from my family and community.” Mahuta says hints about how she will manage the high-profile foreign affairs portfolio can be seen in her “flax-roots” or grassroots politics. How she has handled community affairs is how she will manage international relations, she says. Māori activist Tina Ngata says it is “well overdue that we have a wāhine Māori step into this role”. “Having someone with the connections and commitment to Te Ao Māori comes with an expectation that we will no longer be left behind in these discussions.” As a tribal member of Waikato-Tainui, Ngāti Maniapoto and Ngāti Manu, Mahuta has familial ties to the Māori king, and from a young age assisted her father, Sir Robert Mahuta, who was a famous Indigenous campaigner and negotiator. Joanna Kidman, professor of Māori education at Victoria University of Wellington, says the appointment of Mahuta could lead to a new, Indigenous-influenced way of conducting New Zealand’s international affairs. “I have been delighted with this appointment. Nanaia Mahuta has been a very hardworking politician for 20 years and she is so well known and so highly respected in the Māori world. It was really exciting,” Kidman says. “Nanaia comes from a long tradition of tribal leaders. She comes from generations of leadership. She works really hard at flax-roots level, she can walk into a room of high-level diplomats and politicians, but she is equally at home on the marae (tribal meeting house).” As the pandemic continues, Mahuta says she will have to “up her Zoom game” as she reaches out to foreign governments online. When asked if anything daunts her about the new portfolio, she is unflinching. “I’m going to put my head down and work things out,” says Mahuta. “I’ll throw everything at it.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1719,UK and others look for lessons from Slovakia's Covid mass-testing project,11/6/20,"Authorities in Slovakia say they hope a nationwide programme in which two-thirds of the country’s population were tested for Covid-19 in just two days last weekend will halve the number of cases of the virus in the country. The Slovak testing programme has drawn interest from across Europe, as debates continue about whether or not blanket testing is the best way to fight coronavirus. A Downing Street team travelled to Slovakia last weekend to witness the testing, keen to draw lessons before a mass testing programme due to be launched in Liverpool this weekend. Slovak officials said the team included two Downing Street advisers and two people responsible for arranging the UK’s large-scale testing programme in Liverpool. “They are interested in our lessons and in the details and results,” said Slovakia’s deputy defence minister, Marian Majer, who added that Slovakia has offered to send a planning team to London to help with UK preparations if required. A No 10 spokesperson declined to comment on the visit except to say that “we are constantly seeking to evolve our testing system in order to control the spread of the virus and bring the R rate down”. In Slovakia, the army ran the logistics of the operation, which involved 5,000 eight-person teams working over the weekend, with a combination of military and civilian medics performing the tests. Army medics from Hungary and Austria also took part in the testing. Tests were carried out on 3.6 million out of the country’s 5.4 million population, making it the largest country to carry out a nationwide testing programme so far. A little over 1% of those tested, 38,359 people, tested positive. Rapid antigen tests made in South Korea were used, which give results within half an hour. PCR tests are more accurate but costlier and take longer to process in labs. People were told to come to their local testing point at a particular time, depending on the alphabetical order of their surnames, though Majer admitted it had not always worked, and there were bottleneck periods with long queues. Children under 10 were not obliged to be tested, and people over 65 and those with serious medical conditions were also not recommended to take the test.
Testing was not obligatory, but those who declined to take it were required to quarantine for two weeks, along with those who tested positive. Those who took the test and did not have the virus were given a certificate allowing freedom of movement. The second phase of testing will take place this weekend in 45 of Slovakia’s 79 counties where the infection rate was higher than 0.7%. “We are expecting to cut in half the number of positive cases,” said Majer. Slovakia, like many countries in central Europe, had much lower case numbers than neighbours further west during spring, but has reported increasing numbers in recent weeks. While many countries are considering the potential benefits of mass testing, given that track and trace programmes in many places are be floundering, not everyone is enthusiastic about testing the whole nation. Richard Kollar, a mathematician from Comenius University in Bratislava, said there were two reasons why it was a waste of resources to test the whole country. “The first reason is logistics. China can test a city of 9 million by bringing doctors from other parts of China. But when you try to organise testing the whole country, it’s simply impossible to have enough qualified personnel to do it properly,” he said. He added that mass testing was only suitable in areas with a high prevalence of coronavirus. While the test is believed to give false positives in only 0.4% of cases, when it is used in low prevalence areas this can skew the results. The test’s 0.4% false positive rate means that from the overall sample of 3.64 million in the Slovakia test, around 15,000 of the 38,000 positive cases are likely to be false. And there will have been many more people who do have the virus which the test did not detect. Kollar said the plan to do targeted, repeated testing in Liverpool was a better idea, but positive results should be followed up with more accurate PCR tests. “Frequent, repeated testing in the biggest clusters is what the antigen tests are perfect for,” he said. • This article was amended on 18 November 2020 to clarify that the false positive rate of 0.4% relates to the overall sample number, rather than to the figure for positive cases as an earlier version suggested.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1720,UK recession fears and rivalries take the shine off Rishi Sunak,11/6/20,"From Whitehall to Wetherspoon’s, there was near universal agreement that Rushi Sunak was performing very well under the stresses of the pandemic. At the beginning of the coronavirus crisis the chancellor – a virtual unknown outside the Westminster bubble just months earlier – was getting almost as much airtime as the prime minister and collecting a string of flattering nicknames. There was “Dishy Rishi” for his “Eat out to help out” scheme designed to help restaurants recover from the first national lockdown. The financial news provider Bloomberg also dubbed Sunak, a Star Wars fan, “Britain’s economic Jedi”, for turning on the Treasury’s taps to pay millions of workers’ furlough wages and help save thousands of businesses from collapse. Sunak’s ability to gather such broad support – the pollsters Ipsos Mori found him to be the most popular chancellor since Labour’s Denis Healey in the 1970s – was noted by political pundits, who were quick to cast him as the “prime minister-in-waiting”. He remains the bookies’ firm favourite to take the top job.
But perhaps Sunak, who turned 40 during the first lockdown and has only been an MP since 2015, let his star rise a little too quickly. His rivals are seeding what they hope will be a more lasting, and damaging, label: “Rishi’s recession.” Perhaps this was in the back of his mind when on Thursday he set out the government’s latest spectacular U-turn: extending the furlough scheme to pay up to 80% of a person’s wages up until the end of March 2021. This had not been part of the Sunak master plan, but the chancellor had been under pressure from all sides.
Boris Johnson, who installed Sunak in No 11 in February, and his allies are understood to have launched a subtle campaign to ensure Sunak will be associated with the UK’s deepest recession since records began. His name is also being actively linked with some of the government’s most unpopular policies, including the refusal to concede to the footballer Marcus Rashford’s campaign to extend free school meals over half-term. A Sun on Sunday article headlined Rishi vs Rashi accused Sunak of “parking the Treasury bus” to block £20m needed to feed 1.4 million underprivileged children. Allies of Sunak denied the claim and said the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, had not asked for the money.
“He’ll have to take his share of bad news, not just clean up for stuff that works,” one insider said. A minister was said to grumble that Sunak needed to be told to “stop behaving as if he is PM already”. Whether he blocked it or not, the government’s failure to find £20m for hungry children while the chancellor spent half a billion on Eat out to help out has not gone unnoticed at food banks across the country, including those in Sunak’s Richmond constituency in Yorkshire. Alison Grainger, who helps run a food bank in Northallerton, near Sunak’s £1.5m constituency home, said it was “bewildering and disappointing” that Sunak “could help people rich enough to eat out at restaurants, but not people here who can’t afford to feed their families the basics”. Grainger said she had been impressed by Sunak when he came (along with a publicist and cameraman) to volunteer at the Hambleton Foodshare food bank in the town centre a few years ago. “People in the town have been proud of Rishi and what he’s done during the pandemic,” she said. “But now I think there is a feeling of disappointment, that he’s trying to do his best for big business but leaving the community to come together to feed the kids.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is thought to be working on the assumption it will be Sunak not Johnson he will be fighting at the 2024 general election, and is now zeroing in on the chancellor, blaming him for the economic pain that will be caused by the month-long England-wide lockdown that began this week. Starmer said it was Sunak who blocked the implementation of a less severe two-week “circuit breaker” recommended by the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) in September. “Make no mistake, the chancellor’s name is all over this,” the Labour leader told company bosses at the Confederation of British Industry virtual conference on Monday. “[It was] his decision to block a circuit breaker – to dismiss it as a ‘blunt instrument’.”
Sunak, Starmer said, failed to learn, failed to listen and failed to lead. “The result is tragic – but all too predictable,” Starmer added. “It makes me so angry.” Sunak’s previous winter economy plan, which cut the amount of money workers would receive and increase companies’ contributions, did not even make it to the middle of autumn. His mantra that he “can’t save every job” had changed to say he was acting to “help protect as many jobs as possible” but only those that were “viable”. The suggestion that the chancellor and his mandarins could decide whose jobs were viable and whose weren’t sparked an immediate backlash, particularly among powerful figures in the arts. Asked by ITV News if he was suggesting some of the UK’s “fabulous musicians and artists and actors” should get another job, Sunak said: “As in all walks of life, everyone’s having to adapt.” “I can’t pretend that everyone can do exactly the same job that they were doing at the beginning of this crisis,” he said. “That’s why we’ve put a lot of resource into trying to create new opportunities.” This was met with derision – from stars used to the mud of Glastonbury to those accustomed to the glamour of the Royal Opera House. The British soprano Louise Alder said she couldn’t work in the UK “because my industry doesn’t exist” but could in Germany, where audiences are socially distanced. “In Germany I am ‘viable’. I choose to stay there,” she said. Oasis’s Liam Gallagher attacked government “dopes” for “telling musicians and people in arts to retrain and get another job”. The actor Michelle Collins, who played Cindy Beale in Eastenders, said: “Thirty-five years an actor, I now have a non-viable job. Thanks Rishi Sunak, is that all of us in the arts? We are prevented from working so cannot even work if we wanted to. Absolutely insulting to me and all those people who thrive in and enjoy the arts. Brings £120bn into economy.”
The chancellor, and his team of special advisers and image consultants running his social media campaign on Instagram and Twitter, are keen to point out that it was hard work and ambition that helped Sunak rise to the top. They talk of his summer job as a waiter at Kuti’s Brasserie Indian restaurant in Southampton, where he grew up, and his admiration for Southampton football legend Matt Le Tissier. Less often mentioned is his time as head boy at £13,000-a-term Winchester college, reading PPE at Oxford University or his years working for Goldman Sachs and controversial City hedge funds. Sunak’s own vast personal wealth – which includes a £10m-plus property portfolio with homes in Notting Hill and California as well as a Georgian manor house set in 12 acres of grounds in the village of Kirby Sigston, north Yorkshire – has also caused an unwanted distraction. Around the tearooms in Westminster, MPs are said to speculate that he probably also holds the title of “the richest man in the House of Commons”. “There is a sense that his wealth can make him feel a bit detached from other people,” said one Conservative MP who, like Sunak, was first elected to the Commons in 2015. “Beyond his ministerial team, there’s not really anyone I can think of who you’d say is a close ally.”
The MP said that Sunak’s ambitions were based on projecting a broad sense of competence, rather than forming a clique. “You could argue that he has done quite well so far, but giving out all the money is the easy bit. There’s a long way to go.” It’s impossible to find out just how rich Sunak is or where his millions are invested as he moved his wealth into a blind trust in July 2019. Labour activists have also seized on Sunak’s wealth and “lavish celebrity lifestyle” producing a viral video asking: “Is Dishy Rishi on your side? You decide.” The video, produced by the campaign group One Rule for Them, describes Sunak as “Boris’s smooth-talking people’s politician” and accuses him of planning tax cuts for “his old mates in the City”.
As images of Sunak’s Californian beach house, Yorkshire estate and “mansion in Kensington to boot” flash up, the narrator claims the chancellor once worked for a hedge fund that helped crash the economy. Adam McNicholas, founder of One Rule for Them, which describes itself as “a grassroots campaign fighting back against a government who thinks it’s one rule for their lot and another for the rest of us”, said he decided to create the video to “show the public who Sunak really is”. “Not many people knew he was a hedge fund manager, at a fund that helped crash the economy,” he said. “People need to know that before they make up their minds about him.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1721,"US again breaks daily Covid-19 record with 121,000 cases recorded Thursday",11/6/20,"The United States has broken its record for the highest number of new Covid-19 infections in a single day yet again, with more than 121,000 new cases recorded on Thursday. As the country’s attention has been trained on the presidential election, the US has continued to break daily records for new Covid-19 cases. On Wednesday, the day after the election, the country saw more than 107,000 cases, the first time the US surpassed 100,000 new cases in a single day. Before that, the record was set on 30 October with just over 99,000 new cases. Along with new cases rising, hospitalizations and deaths have slowly begun to increase. About 53,000 people were hospitalized with Covid-19 on Thursday. The number of Covid fatalities across the country was over 1,000 for the third day in a row, with 1,210 deaths on Thursday. Altogether, the US has had more than 9.6m cases of Covid-19 and 234,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic – the most of any country.
Unlike previous surges of the virus in the US, this increase is not concentrated in a single region. Initial increases were seen in the American heartland, particularly in the Dakotas and Wisconsin. In recent weeks, there have been surges in Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado and Minnesota. Increases have also been seen on the east coast, in Maine, Connecticut and Rhode Island. Only two states – Tennessee and Alabama – have had drops in cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. Public health experts have sounded the alarm for weeks over a potential surge in cases as the weather starts to cool in many parts of the country. Now, it is clear that their warnings were prescient. While Donald Trump was saying that the country is “absolutely rounding the corner” with the virus, the White House’s coronavirus taskforce was striking a completely different note in its reports. “There is a continued increase in cases, hospitalizations and fatalities nationally, spreading southward from the coldest climates as the population moves indoors and cases increase exponentially,” according to a report dated 1 November and obtained by CNN. In the reports, the taskforce emphasized that people need to “act now” and encouraged public health measures such as wearing masks and limiting gatherings with people outside one’s household. In an interview with the Washington Post on 30 October, Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, said that the recent increases were only the start of a winter surge. “We’re in for a whole lot of hurt. It’s not a good situation,” he said. “All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.” Fauci emphasized that there would need to be “abrupt changes” in order to curb the spread. But as countries in Europe begin their weeks-long shutdowns, state and local officials in the United States have been reluctant to enact restrictions even amid surges in cases. North Dakota and South Dakota are the only states that do not have full or partial mask mandates. Tony Evers, Wisconsin’s governor, has made pleas to the state’s residents to stay at home and limit interactions, but has not implemented a mandatory stay-at-home order. Recent polls have shown the effects of pandemic fatigue – people getting tired of following strict Covid-19 guidelines – even though the virus’s spread is worsening. A Gallup poll from October showed that fewer Americans are avoiding contact with people outside their households and more are no longer working from home.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1722,US imposes sanctions on Lebanon's former foreign minister,11/6/20,"The Trump administration has imposed Treasury sanctions on one of Lebanon’s most influential politicians as it intensifies attempts to defang the militia and political powerhouse Hezbollah. The move against Gibran Bassil for alleged corruption was announced on Friday as Trump’s chances of re-election continued to dip, and marks a sharp escalation of efforts to limit Hezbollah’s influence in Lebanese affairs. Crucially, it is a direct challenge to the country’s president and Bassil’s father in law, Michel Aoun, who Washington has considered an ally. The decision is likely to derail attempts to form a new government aimed at stymieing an economic and social freefall in a country where fear and poverty is rising daily. It is also a pointed threat to other members of a political class that their personal interests are at stake if they stall on demands made of them in the dying months of the Trump presidency. The allegations of corruption levelled at Bassil could have been made against officials at all levels of government. The former foreign minister, however, was central to a power-sharing pact in 2016 that cemented Hezbollah’s muscular role in Lebanese life and led to Gulf states, which had long acted as benefactors, turning their backs on the ailing nation. Ever since, Bassil had become a deeply divisive figure disliked in equal measure for his alleged role in siphoning state funds away from energy reforms and for giving cover to what has broadly been seen in Washington and the Gulf states as a Hezbollah takeover of Lebanon. Saudi Arabia and the UAE in particular had blamed current prime minister designate, Saad Hariri, for striking a deal with Bassil and Aoun, which consolidated the regional role of Hezbollah’s backer, Iran. In recent months, Washington’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran has switched focus to Hezbollah, which remains the most important arm of Tehran’s foreign policy. Senior Trump officials have acknowledged that they would attempt to use their remaining time in office to move harder against Iranian regional influence than any earlier administration. In a statement, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said: “Throughout his government career, Bassil has become notorious for corruption and has been linked to the purchase of influence within Lebanese political circles. “While minister of energy, Bassil was involved in approving several projects that would have steered Lebanese government funds to individuals close to him through a group of front companies. “Through his corrupt activities, Bassil has also undermined good governance and contributed to the prevailing system of corruption and political patronage that plagues Lebanon, which has aided and abetted Hezbollah’s destabilizing activities.” Faysal Itani, deputy director at the Centre for Global Policy, said: “Bassil is definitely not the only prominent non-Shia politician to give cover to Hezbollah. But as far as sanctions are concerned he is a proverbial low-hanging fruit. Going after his father in law would be seen locally as an attack on the Christians as a whole, and on a sitting president. This is a potent US signal of the cost of being too friendly with Hezbollah. As a bonus, this is a nice boost to Hariri politically as he tries to put a cabinet together, which Bassil’s party has boycotted.” Bassil responded to the move on Twitter, saying “sanctions didn’t scare me and promises didn’t tempt me”. “I will not turn against any Lebanese national … and I’m not saving myself to destroy Lebanon,” he added. “I have grown accustomed to injustice.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1723,Vanuatu pioneers digital cash as disaster relief,11/6/20,"The most at-risk country on earth to natural disasters, Vanuatu has endured two major volcanic eruptions and two category five cyclones in the past half-decade, affecting more than half the population. Through resolute border closures, the Pacific archipelago has escaped infection from Covid-19, but the resultant loss of tourism revenues has devastated the local economy. Vanuatu is a country, sadly, too used to fighting back from disaster. But it is a country, too, seeking new paths to recovery.
Vanuatu is pioneering Unblocked Cash, a mobile-based development project using blockchain technology, along with tap-and-pay cards, to provide direct assistance to families recovering from disasters or acute financial distress. The cards can be ‘loaded’ with money, to act like a debit card, allowing families to directly buy food, medicine, clothes, and other emergency supplies, even hardware to rebuild destroyed homes. Sandra Uwantege Hart, head of Pacific cash and livelihoods for Oxfam in Vanuatu, told the Guardian the project emerged out of an effort to “shift the delivery model for humanitarian assistance… from goods to cash and vouchers”. The approach “is more market-friendly, [and] gives people more dignity and flexibility”.
It’s also, proponents argue, more efficient. Traditionally, it typically costs between $2 - $3 to deploy $1 worth of aid post-disaster. The digital model reduces aid distribution costs by up to 75%, Oxfam claims, taking only three minutes to register each new recipient on the network. Older approaches could take over an hour. Over the next few months, over 35,000 new participants across Vanuatu are expected to be enrolled in the project, jointly funded by New Zealand and Australia. Hart and over a dozen local partner groups have spent several years seeking ways to put money directly into the pockets of those most affected by disaster. Financial services infrastructure across Vanuatu’s islands “is our weakest link”, Hart said. Unblocked Cash, she said, establishes a cashless payment system with few overheads. The project doesn’t use cryptocurrency directly, but every transaction is tokenised and stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Personal data is kept separate in compliance with international privacy standards. The project’s software – most of which is open source and can be freely shared and adapted - was written by Melbourne-based Sempo. Traditional disaster responses are often ‘top-heavy’, and rebuilding local economies is rarely prioritised. Local businesses are often bypassed, and find themselves competing directly with external contractors, who flood recovering communities with goods at low or no cost to consumers. The Vanuatu Business Resilience Council was founded in 2017 as a counter this, and to establish a greater role for the local private sector in disaster response. Nicola Barnes, who helped local businesses set up for the project, said, despite some issues with digital and financial literacy, the roll-out has been broadly accepted. She said the new system was a potentially transformative method of delivering disaster relief, and said blockchain technologies could even be integrated with existing local systems, such as QR codes installed on national ID cards. “If it was blended in, it would make us more disaster resilient, and it would make it much quicker and easier to use immediately after a disaster.” Trust of the unfamiliar seems to have been the biggest hurdle. One recipient said, “the first time that I have been shopping, I was afraid that there was no money on the e-voucher, but after the first time I think it was just easy”.
The project is being rolled out across the Pacific region, and around the world. Vanuatu trainers are assisting with trials in Goroka, Papua New Guinea. A Solomon Islands project is slated to begin early in 2021, and pilot projects are underway in Colombia with collaboration from Spain. Unblocked Cash won’t work everywhere. Places with robust electronic banking systems don’t need it. But in remote or badly damaged areas, or in places suffering hyperinflation, it offers a lightweight, efficient and low-impact means of putting cash in people’s pockets. Centralised disaster response has often been a magnet for inflated no-bid contracts, wastage due to spoiling and theft, and favouritism when aid is distributed.
Cash, by contrast, has proven surprisingly resistant to corruption. One rollout to 2800 Vanuatu families saw three abuse complaints. Only one proved valid. Spending is tracked and profiteering is easily discovered. Hart also suggested that a pure cryptocurrency version of the app could be used by thousands of Pacific seasonal workers to send money home without the often-exorbitant fees and long delays of traditional remittance services.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1724,Zimbabwe: Hopewell Chin'ono kept in jail after bail hearing postponed,11/6/20,"The Zimbabwean journalist and anti-corruption campaigner Hopewell Chin’ono will spend the weekend in a high security prison after a magistrate postponed his bail hearing to Monday. Chin’ono was rearrested at his home in the capital, Harare, on Tuesday evening for allegedly breaking his bail conditions and has been detained since. The respected documentary-maker was first arrested in July after publishing a series of investigations into corruption by senior public officials in Zimbabwe. He was held in an overcrowded cell in Chikurubi high-security prison for almost six weeks pending trial on charges of inciting violence. On his release in September, Chin’ono was effectively banned from using social media for anything that could be seen as critical of the Zanu-PF government. He did, however, give a series of media interviews in which he described the horrific conditions he faced in prison. Beatrice Mtwetwa, Zimbabwe’s best-known human rights lawyer, told the court on Friday that Chin’ono, who has not yet faced trial, was being detained with convicted prisoners and had been held for more than 48 hours before being brought to court. He was brought to court just before the end of the day on Thursday, which his lawyers said was a deliberate tactic to delay proceedings. The new charge is related to comments Chin’ono made about possessing classified information from the national prosecuting authority relating to Henrietta Rushwaya, the president of the Zimbabwe Miners’ Federation, who was arrested last week at Harare’s airport and has been charged with attempting to smuggle gold to Dubai. According to court papers, Chin’ono “claims to be engaged in a relationship with the national prosecution authority thereby jeopardising the integrity of the case against himself and that of Henrietta Rushwaya.” Rushwaya has denied any wrongdoing. Chin’ono, who denies the new charge against him, was brought to court in leg irons. The EU’s office in Zimbabwe expressed concern over his rearrest and detention. “Hopewell Chin’ono’s detention sends a chilling signal on freedom of opinion and expression in Zimbabwe. Exposing corruption is not a crime, the fight against corruption is a declared government priority,” it said on Twitter. The British ambassador to Zimbabwe, Melanie Robinson, said Chin’ono had “consistently spoken out about corruption in Zimbabwe” and expressed concerns “about the signals the case against him sends to journalists here”.",,Foreign,Guardian,5

1745,It's reawakened something': creative ambitions blossom for lockdown 2,11/7/20,"The first lockdown left Hannah Taggart, a software developer from Belfast, “Zoom-quizzed out”. She also, she admits, drank too much. The second lockdown will be different, she has promised herself. “I’ve opted to direct my energy into something I can be proud of and look back on fondly, rather than having to think again: ‘Oh God, what did I do for three months?’” Taggart has always wanted to draw, especially comics and graphic novels. “My ideal goal is to be able to draw something for our child’s nursery, due May 2021,” she said. She’s not alone. On the Monday after the announcement of the English lockdown, Duolingo had a 19% increase in registrations, with particular interest in the site’s bilingual podcasts and virtual lessons. Drawing, DIY, second languages … the creativity generated by the second lockdown covers multiple bases.
Open University says it is preparing for a repeat of the 622% spike in registrations for online creative subjects it received during the first lockdown, the most popular being creative writing courses, some of which had a 16-fold increase in demand; modern languages, which had an eight-fold increase; and online dance skills, which had eight times as many visitors in lockdown. Pinterest has also had a 130% increase in viewings in the UK of “how to” videos for sewing gifts; a 115% increase for crochet gifts; and a 40% increase in searches for “how to make DIY gifts for friends”. Kickstarter says it is expecting a surge in applications to their Inside Voices project, launched during the first lockdown to support small projects that can be run from home. Second lockdowns were announced at different times across the UK. But with each announcement, creativity flared. When Wales went into its second lockdown, Anthony Bird, the council mayor of Cwmbran, south Wales, knew exactly what he wanted to do with his extra time at home: make a cadaver-shaped buffet bar for his daughter’s Halloween party and a Hawaiian drinks bar in the garden for when the weather improves in the summer.
He said: “The first lockdown was just reactive. I was looking for things to keep me sane. We knew this second lockdown was coming, so I had time to plan it, learning from the first one. It’s reawakened something childlike in me that I haven’t felt in years.” The second lockdown is a chance for others to build on what they created during the first lockdown. Thor McIntyre-Burnie, an artist and director of Aswarm, a public arts organisation in the UK, is going to use the time to launch the online project he created over the spring and summer.
He said: “Lockdown 2.0 is a perfect time to share the project with people and for them to play with it, especially as it now also has a layer about reflecting on lockdown 1.0.” “This second lockdown will affect people’s creativity in a number of different ways,” said Meredith Graves, director of Music at Kickstarter. “Some may feel they’ve been given a second gift of more time to create. For others, the feelings stirred up by yet another lockdown and the current global political climate may energise their artistic process, and inspire new work.” Inside Voices was particularly successful in the UK, Graves said. Since launching the initiative in April, $330,000 (£251,545) has been promised to 42 projects run from people’s homes across the UK. The crossover from individual creativity to online entrepreneurship is beginning to show in the data, said Russell Haworth, the CEO of the domain registry Nominet. He said: “We noted a 20% increase in registrations by individuals during the first lockdown, which suggested that people were willing to take their hobbies and interests – most popularly, dance, crafts and sewing – online and turn them into businesses. “We expect a second increase in domain registrations of creative businesses run by individuals, specifically those targeted at customers’ hobbies, during a second lockdown,” he added. Sandi Mann, a senior psychology lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire and author of the books The Upside of Downtime and The Science of Boredom, believes the repetition of another lockdown might be a powerful spur to creativity. Mann has carried out research to prove that boredom can be a creative force. “I’ve done a mini-version of lockdown near my university in Preston in the UK, where we’ve got people in isolation cubicles,” she said. “We’ve seen what happens when people are really bored, and it actually makes them more creative. “It’s crucial not to fight that boredom,” she added. “The key to creativity is to let your mind wander, to daydream. So this period of lockdown that we’re all experiencing all over the world could turn out to be our greatest period of creativity in the whole history of mankind.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1746,Seeing the painting helped me heal': the NHS workers captured on canvas,11/7/20,"Tom Croft normally paints with the radio on. But when coronavirus swept through the UK this spring, the 50-year-old artist from Oxford found he couldn’t paint any more. “I was listening to rolling news, of things getting bleaker and bleaker, and I just ground to a halt,” he says. A chance encounter with a doctor friend in April made him acutely aware of the pressures healthcare workers were under. “I asked him how he was doing, and he was too tired to answer. He said, ‘You don’t want to know.’” Croft asked himself what he could do. “Pushing paint around a canvas doesn’t help a pandemic go away.” But he started to think about the portraits of the great and the good that line our art galleries, and the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic will be one of the defining events of the 21st century. Why not commemorate NHS workers in the same way? Croft posted on social media, offering to paint a free portrait of an NHS worker. Overwhelmed by the response, he widened the field, and over the following months matched more than 500 artists with doctors, nurses, paramedics and other frontline workers. “Everyone feels that NHS workers are undervalued,” he explains. “We all know they should be paid more. I thought this could be a way to raise their status, a way of saying thank you. A portrait is a physical thing – it exists in the real world, and will outlast us all.” Here are some of those paintings, and the stories behind them. Nightshift: Nancy Faulkner, by Gillian Horn Faulkner, 48, is a senior sister at the Royal London hospital This was painted when I had just been redeployed to the intensive care unit (ITU). I normally work in the ear, nose and throat department, but I have a background in trauma and intensive care, so I knew early on that I wanted to be somewhere I could be useful. You can see the exhaustion on my face. It was like nothing I’ve ever experienced before, and I’ve seen lots of horrific things. The night shifts were the most challenging. We had six patients in a ward that would normally have four. You’d be trying to care for patients who had just arrived, and others would be dying. And you’re doing all of that in PPE, which is so hot and claustrophobic. You’d want to rip it off at the end of a shift, but you couldn’t, because it was contaminated and dangerous. I worked in the ITU for 12 weeks straight. We’d do two day shifts and two nights shifts in a row, with two days off in between, which were spent sleeping. I’ve never known exhaustion like it: if I sat down for five minutes I’d fall asleep. I was diagnosed with PTSD this summer. It’s been really hard. When Gillian delivered the painting to me, I’d been off work for a few weeks with severe symptoms. It was emotional seeing the painting, but also healing. It made me realise that I am out of the situation, and safe again. And it helped me to acknowledge what I had been through. Horn, 52, is an artist and architect, from London I found painting Nancy incredibly moving. I’d never met her, but felt connected to her after so many hours poring over her face, and studying her Instagram posts. I wanted my painting to capture the weight of Nancy’s experiences: a sense of the physical and emotional toll, but also her compassion and resilience: her humanity. Trauma, by Alastair Faulkner
Peter Davies, 32, is an orthopaedic surgeon and trauma registrar at Ninewells hospital, Dundee It was weird, going to work in the early weeks. I’d be driving in and mine would be the only car on the road. At the hospital, you think about Covid-19 all the time. Then you come out of hospital, and every time you turn on the TV or look at a newspaper, it’s there. It’s constant. I wasn’t redeployed, so I carried on my usual work as an orthopaedic surgeon. People sometimes forget that the rest of the hospital doesn’t just stop: people still break bones, and need surgery. Having to wear full PPE in theatre was tough. It’s extremely sweaty, and hard to communicate. I haven’t been able to see my parents since February. Even with the best precautions in the world, it’s almost impossible to avoid being exposed to the virus in the hospital, and I couldn’t live with myself if I gave them Covid-19.Zoom has made things easier, but it’s a long time. Faulkner, 32, is a surgeon and artist based in Dundee Every morning we discuss any new patients who have been admitted: it’s known as the “trauma meeting”. I wanted to paint a group portrait showcasing all the different team members involved and delivering patient care. I took inspiration from Renaissance painters including Da Vinci and Caravaggio, as well as historical paintings depicting healthcare workers, such as Rembrandt’s Anatomy Lesson Of Dr Nicolaes Tulp. I wanted to paint something in that style, but juxtaposed with modern subjects and context. The painting encompasses two huge factors in my life: my love of surgery, and art, which is why I painted myself into the group portrait. Working on the painting during the pandemic really helped me mentally and kept me focused. I hope it represents everything good about the NHS I work in, and love. Dr Salman Visiting His Family, by Nick Richards
Dr Muhammad Salman, 36, is a gastroenterology registrar at James Cook university hospital, Middlesbrough. During the first wave, he was redeployed to the Covid-19 ward. I spent six weeks living away from the family home – from my wife and three children, who are five, seven, and nine, because one of my daughters is asthmatic. This painting is based on one of my rare trips to see my family, through a window. When doctors and nurses started falling sick and dying with Covid-19, I had to explain to my kids that Dad might not be coming home. My youngest daughter said, “Where are you going? I’ll come with you.” But my oldest understood that meant that her dad might die. I think she was quite traumatised by that. We lost a few nurses to Covid in my trust, and a doctor. A lot of my colleagues have long Covid, with lifelong irreversible damage to their nerves. The fact that we have one of the highest mortality rates in the world is appalling. I don’t think the government has handled this well. We had enough time to prepare ourselves; we should have looked at Italy, and got ready. The cases are starting to rise again in my hospital. A lot of people are going to lose loved ones in the next few months. I am dreading having to play God: deciding which of my patients I’m most likely to be able to save. Making decisions like that never leaves you. Richards, 49, is an artist from Sydenham, London I found Dr Salman through Facebook. The image he suggested – being separated from his daughters through the glass – was very powerful. I wanted to avoid sentimentality, so I used a bold, impasto technique, with thick oil paint and a large brush. It was about conveying raw emotion in an expressive way, rather than focusing too narrowly on detail. Katie Tomkins, by Roxana Halls
Tomkins, 40, is a mortuary and postmortem services manager at West Hertfordshire hospitals NHS trust I’ve been doing this for 21 years; I worked in the aftermath of 7/7 – but this was something different. We had our first Covid death in March, and within a fortnight it was like a storm had descended. We were running out of space. People were dying faster than we could move them through. In addition, I was worried about my staff falling sick. How would we manage if they had to self-isolate? Under normal circumstances, a big part of my job is liaising with families and guiding them through the process of viewing their loved ones. It was hard to not be able to do that. Having to tell bereaved families over the phone that they couldn’t say goodbye was tough. When I look at Roxana’s painting, I see someone who’s exhausted, slightly burned out, but determined to get the job done. That’s exactly how I felt. Halls, 46, is an artist from London When I met Katie via video link I was awestruck by her strength and tenderness, but also by her distinctive appearance. She reminded me of the wartime portraits by Dame Laura Knight, and the famous image of Rosie the Riveter from second world war posters. I wanted my portrait to evoke that same sense of focus, resolve and heroism. Having the opportunity to paint someone as remarkable as Katie, and illuminate the critical role of mortuary care, has been an absolute gift. Jermaine, by Emma Worth
Jermaine Wright was a senior pharmacy technician at Hammersmith hospital, London. He died of Covid-19 on 27 April, at the age of 45. His friend and colleague, Alison Oliver, 46, a senior lead pharmacy technician, remembers him Jermaine and I went to school together. Then, years later, he came for a job interview in my department. I couldn’t believe it. It was strange at first, because I was his boss, but we became good friends. Jermaine would always tease me. He’d tell people I used to be really bad at school, when I wasn’t! He was exactly the same as he was at school: popular, cheeky. Every Valentine’s Day, he’d bring in chocolates for everyone. He was a hard worker: he’d always be the first person in and the last out. The day we found out he had died was horrific. My boss called a meeting and the minute she walked into the room, I could tell from her body language that Jermaine was dead. I couldn’t stay in the room. There are only 10 people in my team, and Jermaine’s loss has affected us hugely. I cried for weeks. We speak about him all the time. I feel it’s important to bring up his name, so he’s not forgotten. We screened Jermaine’s funeral on TV at work, and more than 80 people turned up. That shows how loved he was. Worth, 34, is an artist from Liverpool I felt such a sense of loss and responsibility every time I picked up my brush. Jermaine’s friends described him as the life and soul of the party, so I wanted to reflect that energy. I feel very grateful to be able to tell his story: how brave he was, and what a hero. Liam Halliwell, by Laura Quinn Harris
Halliwell, 41, is a paramedic for the North West ambulance service, based in Manchester I’ve never experienced anxiety at work before, but those first few weeks just before lockdown, there was tension in the air. That’s my overriding memory: the anxiety. In my job, I spend time in the control room, triaging calls. I remember getting a call from a doctor: it was startling how unwell she was. She was struggling to speak on the phone. She was only in her late 30s. One of the hardest things about my job is that you have this intense, brief period of time with someone, where you’re doing everything you can to help them, and then they go to hospital, and that’s the last you see of them. You wonder how they got on. The call rate in the early weeks was relentless, but then people got scared of going to hospital, so they stopped calling so much. I got sick with Covid-19 in April. That was scary, because my son has asthma. I was terrified I’d pass it on to him. Thankfully, I recovered OK – and he was fine, too. Quinn Harris, 36, is an artist from Wigan Liam is a friend; I wanted to paint him as a token of my gratitude to him, and all the other key workers. I hope his kindness and dedication shine through. Ma Soeur, by Donna Maria Kelly
Nikki Hedges, 33, pictured with her sister Becky Sheppard, is an organ donation specialist nurse at Luton and Dunstable university hospital in Bedfordshire When I was 18, I went to South Africa for two months, and seeing the poverty there made me realise how much I’d taken the NHS for granted. That was what inspired me to train as a nurse. My sister Becky works in the same hospital as me, although in a different department, and having her there during the pandemic was such an emotional support. The photograph that Donna based her painting on was one I took on a break in my shift to send to my family. It was only meant to be a quick selfie, but it really captures the bond that Becky and I have. So many people died on their own. It was horrible having to turn away people who wanted to say goodbye to their loved ones. I nursed a former colleague; she was intubated and unconscious, so she won’t remember it. It was such a horrible shock, seeing her come in. We didn’t think she was going to make it, but she did. Watching her recover was special. The aftermath has been really hard. I’ve been off work with PTSD, and I am seeing a psychologist. You can feel really alone. But I want people to know that NHS staff are human as well. There’s no shame in reaching out for help. Kelly, 42, is an artist from Hertfordshire When Nikki contacted me to ask if I could paint a portrait of her with Becky, I said yes immediately. I was separated from my own family for the first few months, and have two sisters, so I know how special that bond is. I wanted to show the love that was clearly there, but also express my respect for the NHS. It saved my daughter’s life eight years ago, when she was hospitalised with a heart disease. I am thankful every day. Meg, by Rosie Mark
Megan Cavanagh, 26, is a newly qualified nurse at Aintree university hospital near Liverpool. During the pandemic, she volunteered as a student nurse It was my job to sit with people as they were dying from Covid-19, and comfort them, hold their hand. At that time, we weren’t allowed visitors, so it was just me with the patients as they drew their last breaths. You’d be trying to be strong, and not show any emotion. Sometimes they’d say that they wanted to see their family. I just held their hand and told them that everything would be OK. There was nothing else I could say. At night, I’d go home and cry. Since the first wave, I’ve qualified and moved to a different ward. Last month we went into lockdown again. My ward has dementia patients, and around half have Covid-19 now. I’m five months pregnant, so I’m working in the office because I’m high risk. But the staff are under a lot of pressure, especially because dementia patients can get unsettled. I’m praying that when I come back from maternity leave, this pandemic will be a distant memory. I have set up a memory box, with the portrait Rosie painted in it, and thank-you cards from the families of the people I helped. For the rest of my life, I will be proud of myself for working through the pandemic, and especially for being with those patients in their last hours. Mark, 58, is an artist from Crossford, Scotland The photo this was based on had been taken at the end of a long and difficult shift, and Megan was drained. I wanted to convey the physical and emotional toll the pandemic was taking; I think it can be seen in her eyes. NHS Hero – Dr Sekina Bakare – Intensivist, by Emma Woollard
Dr Bakare, 36, is an ICU and anaesthetics doctor at Charing Cross hospital, London. During the first wave, she was based at Northwick Park hospital, London Emma managed to capture the defiance of our fight. My expression communicates not only the struggle that all healthcare workers were going through, but also a sense of power and calm. She portrayed a strong Black woman in medicine. That confidence came from being in a supportive environment. Northwick Park was badly hit, but there was such a sense that the community was rallying around us. People brought food into the hospital, sent us cards. Schools donated PPE. I saw the best of our country then: compassion, generosity and unity. Being away from my two young sons was tough, but it was amazing to be able to come home and see them in the evening. I’m Black British, of Nigerian descent. It was scary seeing a lot of people coming into hospital who were seriously unwell, and who looked like me. It was also really hard when colleagues fell ill: quite a few health workers ended up in intensive care. I remember when one nurse was discharged from hospital: we lined the corridors to applaud her out. That moved me to tears. Not all of my colleagues made it. Woollard is an artist from Notting Hill, London After a video call with Sekina, I had a strong idea of how I wanted the portrait to look. Sekina is not only very beautiful but projects this powerful sense of calm. I asked her to get a colleague to photograph her in profile. I wanted to portray Sekina’s strength, focus, and serenity, amid the chaos. I spent six months in an NHS hospital by my mother’s side as she was dying, and it gave me an idea of how heroic the staff are. It can be easy to take the NHS for granted, until you travel to other countries that don’t have universal healthcare – and realise how lucky we are. Dr Oge Igwe, by Heidi Hart
Igwe, 32, is a doctor working at Furness general hospital, Barrow I worked in the Covid-19 ward for six months, during the peak of the pandemic. You felt such an extreme range of emotions: satisfaction when you saw that people were getting better, and frustration when the medical interventions weren’t working. This project felt like the best of humanity coming together. You had people like Heidi, who are so talented, giving their time, and other people like my colleagues, working together for the good of everyone on the ward. When I saw the painting I was very pleased with the level of artistry that went into it. You could tell how much love she put into it. If someone saw that on the wall of my house, they’d think I paid a lot of money for it. I moved to the UK three years ago, from Nigeria. I think British people don’t always realise this, because they’re used to it, but the NHS really is the best gift that British people have. Hart, 47, is an artist from Hilperton, Wiltshire It was hard to find time to chat with Dr Igwe, because he worked such long hours. So I went through his Instagram page instead, and found the perfect image to base my portrait on. He’s slumped over, wearing his uniform, looking tired and wrung out. It really summarised what all the frontline staff were going through. Nothing any of us could do goes far enough to thank the NHS staff for what they’ve done this year, but I hope that Dr Igwe feels a bit more appreciated, with my painting.

1747,Aspirin to be tested in UK as potential coronavirus treatment,11/7/20,"Thousands of coronavirus patients in Britain will be given aspirin as part of a trial to determine whether the painkiller can reduce the risk of dangerous blood clots. The cheap and widely available drug has been added to a list of potential treatments to be tested as part of the Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 therapy (Recovery) trial, one of the biggest in Britain. People infected with coronavirus seem to have hyper-reactive platelets, the cell fragments that help stop bleeding, which means that they are at higher risk of potentially deadly blood clots, scientists say. Experts hope that aspirin, an anti-platelet agent which is commonly used as a blood thinner, can reduce the possibility of clotting complications. “Aspirin is widely used to prevent blood clots in many other conditions, including heart attack, stroke, and pre-eclampsia in pregnant women,” said Prof Martin Landray, co-chief investigator of the trial. “But enrolling patients in a randomised trial such as Recovery is the only way to assess whether there are clear benefits for patients with Covid-19 and whether those benefits outweigh any potential side-effects such as the risk of bleeding.” At least 2,000 patients are expected to get 150mg of aspirin daily along with the usual regimen. Data from those patients will be compared with at least 2,000 other patients who receive the standard Covid-19 treatment on its own. Small daily doses of aspirin have been found to reduce the risk of certain cancers. As a blood thinner, it increases the risk of internal bleeding, and taking too much over a long period of time has been associated with kidney damage. Other treatments being tested in the Recovery trial include antibody-rich plasma collected from recovered Covid-19 patients, and Regeneron’s antibody cocktail that was used to treat Donald Trump’s Covid-19 symptoms. The decision to add aspirin to this list was made by the Oxford University researchers leading the trial and England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, following a recommendation by the UK Covid-19 Therapeutics Advisory Panel.
Unlike Gilead’s remdesivir, which has been approved as a Covid-19 treatment in the US but has shown poor results in a large World Health Organization trial, aspirin is a generic drug, making it much cheaper. The Recovery trial was the first to show that dexamethasone, a steroid that is also cheap and widely available, could save lives of people severely ill with Covid-19. It also showed that the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, once touted by Trump as a cure, was of no benefit in treating Covid-19 patients.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1748,Brexit talks remain deadlocked going into decisive week,11/7/20,"The Brexit negotiations remained stuck after a call between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen before a decisive week of talks. The European commission president and the prime minister both highlighted in their post-call statements the contentious issues of EU access to British waters and agreement on future rules to ensure fair competition. Von der Leyen tweeted that “some progress has been made, but large differences remain” with just over a week remaining before the UK and EU parliaments need to begin ratification of a trade and security deal. A statement from Downing Street emphasised the need to “redouble efforts” when the two sides, led by the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his British counterpart, David Frost, re-engage on Monday. A Downing Street spokesman said after Saturday’s call: “The prime minister set out that, while some progress had been made in recent discussions, significant differences remain in a number of areas, including the so-called level playing field and fish. “The prime minister and president agreed that their negotiating teams would continue talks in London next week, beginning on Monday, in order to redouble efforts to reach a deal.” The negotiations are entering a decisive phase. But Barnier privately warned last week that the talks are not on a “trajectory” for a deal, telling MEPs that the coming week offered the last opportunity for common ground to be found. On fishing, Barnier has told diplomats there is a big gap between the sides on quotas and that “access to the 6-12 mile fishing zone” remains a sticking point for France and Ireland, which point to their fishing fleets operating in those seas for centuries. One source said the EU was nevertheless seeking to help Johnson to overcome his political problems at home in order to get the deal over the line but that the gaps in terms of quotas remained too big for the EU to be able to start selling the deal to member states. But in Brussels, the greatest concern is the lack of progress on the issues of standards and domestic subsidies, or state aid. The EU has proposed high-level principles on state subsidies to which both sides would agree. The UK would also establish an independent competition authority and there would be a dispute settlement mechanism with both sides able to take swift retaliatory action during an arbitration period if there is a clear breach of the rules. Downing Street has suggested, however, that the threshold for unilateral action needs to be a clear impact on trade from a subsidy rather than a mere risk. Meanwhile, on the issue of standards, the UK has agreed to non-regression from current environmental, labour and social regulations but there has been a clash over how the two sides will develop their laws over time. “We are nowhere,” said one source. There are also concerns about progress on customs facilitation to allow goods to be exported and imported with the minimum of checks. The two sides have clashed on the UK’s insistence that international standards for goods should be mutually recognised as acceptable by either side rather than EU rules. According to a leaked memo seen by the Guardian, Barnier is concerned this issue could “derail” the entire customs declarations system.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1749,Chief of staff Mark Meadows tests positive for Covid-19,11/7/20,"Donald Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, has tested positive for Covid-19, along with at least one other aide to the president. Two senior administration officials confirmed the diagnosis to the Associated Press. The news came just days after Meadows appeared with Trump at a White House event along with numerous people who were not wearing masks.
Neither Meadows nor the White House has commented or confirmed that he contracted the virus and little is known about when or if he has developed symptoms, but advisers told reporters on Friday night that he shared the news with others at the White House after Tuesday’s election.
The news came during a week that the US set daily records for confirmed cases during the pandemic, which has so far killed more than 236,000 Americans. Despite warnings from top health officials, Meadows has been critical of wearing masks, and even refused to keep one while speaking to reporters in October. He was seen in the early hours of Wednesday morning again without a mask on, standing close to the president’s family, as Trump took the stage to illegitimately and prematurely declare himself the winner in an election it looks increasingly unlikely he can win.
Nick Trainer, a Trump campaign aide, also has tested positive for the virus according to Bloomberg and sources say at least three other aids also have the disease. This marks what could be the third outbreak of Covid to hit the White House and more than three dozen associates have already gotten the virus, including the president and the first lady.
The administration has sought to contain the news when officials fell ill, and Meadows is largely believed to be behind those efforts. When pressed by CNN’s Jake Tapper after several of vice-president Mike Pence’s staff tested positive last month, Meadows said “sharing personal information is nothing something that we should do”. He also admitted that the Trump administration was no longer working to “control the pandemic” and was instead waiting for the development of a vaccine.
The new outbreak inside the White House comes as the US faces grim new records. On Thursday, roughly 122,000 new coronavirus cases were reported, the third consecutive day with more than 100,000. More than 9.7 million people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in the US so far this year. Agencies contributed to the reporting.",,Foreign,Guardian,5

As Canada battles its second wave of coronavirus infections, public health officials in the countryâ€™s western region are growing concerned as cases surge to new daily records. Active coronavirus cases in Alberta have quadrupled in the last five weeks. British Columbia, with 5 million residents, notched up more than 400 new cases. France registered a record 60,486 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday, following the previous high of 58,046 on Thursday, health ministry data showed. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday reported 117,988 new coronavirus cases, taking the countryâ€™s total caseload to 9,581,770.The number of deaths also increased by 1,135 to 234,264.

1751,"Good neighbours? No, UK’s community spirit fell in summer Covid lockdown",11/7/20,"From the likes of Liam Gallagher and Take That’s Mark Owen leading spirit-raising singalongs in Manchester, to the generous donations that flooded in to Captain Sir Tom Moore, the Covid pandemic appears to have brought the nation together. But it transpires that neighbourhood cohesion, despite anecdotal evidence suggesting it was high at the start of the pandemic, declined during the UK’s locked-down summer, according to research from Essex and Manchester universities. Researchers Magda Borkowska and James Laurence used the UK-wide Understanding Society household panel study to examine how people felt about their neighbours and neighbourhood in June 2020 compared with 2012 and 2015. Surprisingly, they found that, across the whole population, the percentage of people reporting positive feelings about their community was at its lowest during the pandemic period. The number of people who felt that they could trust other people in their neighbourhood declined from nearly 70% in 2012 to 56% in 2020. The lockdown also seems to have made people feel more isolated. The analysis found only 45% of people in 2020 felt similar to others living around them, 17 points lower than in 2015. “The lockdown meant that people spent more time at home and in their local community,” Borkowska said. “We were expecting this focus on home to make people feel more positively about their neighbourhood, but instead found that people felt more isolated and less trusting of the people that they live near.” Talking to neighbours declined during the pandemic, probably because of the lockdown and the need to socially distance, the researchers suggest. Just over 50% of people reported talking to their neighbours in June, compared with 60% in 2015. The belief that people were willing to help their neighbours also declined. In June, 65% of people agreed that people in their community helped each other out, compared with just over 70% in 2015.
Changes in social cohesion were seen across all areas of the UK and for all socio-demographic groups. However, some groups saw a greater decline than others. People living in the most deprived neighbourhoods, those aged under 35 and members of certain ethnic minority communities – Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black – experienced the largest declines. When compared with previous years, the steeper decline in neighbourhood cohesion for the most deprived areas and for ethnic minority groups appears to be a distinct and new change, compared with the years before the pandemic – although something similar appears to have occurred during the financial crisis of 2008. The study notes: “With the onset of the recession, rates of formal and informal helping behaviours declined among all people, but with particularly precipitous drops among residents of disadvantaged communities.” Borkowska said the study’s findings had implications for the government as it wrestled with the prospect of imposing further lockdowns. “If lockdowns have the effect of making people less neighbourly, this suggests that there is significant work to be done to build up community cohesion as the local lockdowns continue this winter and when the pandemic has passed.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1752,"Graphs in England lockdown presentation were a mess, says statistics guru",11/7/20,"England needed dramatic action to reduce the spread of coronavirus, despite the government’s messy presentation of data to justify the latest lockdown, according to an expert. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a non-executive board member at the UK Statistics Authority, said one slide shown at last Saturday’s press conference suggesting a possible peak of 4,000 deaths was “really ghastly”. He said the data was out of date and had never been meant to be part of any formal document. Spiegelhalter told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It has been a mess, it really has. All those graphs that got put up at the press conference last Saturday, the projections were out of date at the time, they’re definitely out of date. “That one [the slide about 4,000 deaths] was really ghastly – that was out of date when shown. It was never meant to be part of any formal document. It was leaked early and then it was part of the briefing to MPs.” He said projections did have some “validity” but needed to be “taken with extreme caution”, as they could often be out of date by the time they were shown. “Another projection of short-term deaths up until 6 December, and there’s been accusations of a conspiracy, because it’s changed between the press conference and what’s been released now. The slides have changed for technical reasons, but it makes it look a bit less dramatic.” The top-end projection of the revised graph did not exceed the peak of the first wave of coronavirus deaths, he said. However, “if you read the small print, there was only a 50/50 chance it could be in or outside that range”.
The statistician and chair of the Winton centre for risk and evidence communication at the University of Cambridge said projections were models of possible futures based on numerous assumptions and were usually out of date by the time they were shown. “So they have got some value but they have to be taken with extreme caution,” he added. Spiegelhalter was asked about comments from Prof Tim Spector at King’s College London – which has been monitoring the symptoms and test results of millions of people through its Covid app – who said on Friday that the peak was likely to have already passed. “We can’t rely simply on confirmed cases or daily deaths without putting them into context,” Spector said. “Hospital admissions are rising as expected, but deaths are still average for the season.” Spiegelhalter said: “If this is going to go down, it is going to go down very slowly unless some dramatic action is taken, which has been taken. The point is we are getting about 20,000-25,000 positive tests a day, that feeds through to about 1,500 hospitalisations a day, about 250-300 deaths a day and these are broadly stable but going up a bit – the deaths in hospitals and hospitalisations are going up slowly – and we are coming into winter. “Those sorts of levels, even if they stay very stable and below the first peak of the virus, unless they start dropping, we are stuck with those for months and it seems to me and others that that’s not going to be sustainable in terms of what the health service can deal with … so it can stay open for everyone else.” The Office for National Statistics has indicated that the steep rise in new infections was levelling off in England and stabilising at about 50,000 a day, with an estimated 618,700 people having the disease during the most recent week to 31 October, up from 568,100 the previous week.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1753,"Test and trace needs radical reform in England, health experts say",11/7/20,"The government faces renewed calls for the central NHS test and trace system to be scrapped in favour of handing responsibility for contact tracing to local public health teams. Weekly test and trace figures for England show it reached just under 60% of close contacts of people testing positive, the lowest since the service began. It comes as the Office for National Statistics indicated the steep rise in new infections was levelling off in England and stabilising at about 50,000 a day. Sir John Oldham, adjunct professor in global health innovation at Imperial College London and former leader of large-scale change at the Department of Health, said “lockdown will be a letdown” unless trust was increased through radical reform of test and trace. “I think this probably includes increasing the number of small labs to decrease turnaround time and, crucially, the results to go to local directors of health and for them to have teams to undertake the contact tracing,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I’d probably get the resources for that by scrapping the failing central call centres. I think the whole system should be under the purview of public health, which gets us as close to the effective system we had before 2012 NHS reforms. I think they have demonstrated that they have the capability and effectiveness – they are running at 95% contact tracing; the national call centre is at 60%.” Oldham suggested lockdown could be futile unless there was an effective test and trace system – “such as in South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany” – to keep numbers down after restrictions were relaxed. “This we’ve been continually promised but there has been a failure to deliver,” he said. He added that trust was paramount as he advocated the use of local contact tracers. “The pandemic is seen as a political campaign with huge promises and slogans. The virus does not tweet back or send out press releases. We just need some truthfulness, transparency about the data and the outcomes and decision making … Greater understanding gives greater trust and greater adherence for what we want people to do.” Thousands of people were tested in Liverpool on the first day of the mass pilot scheme on Friday. The programme aims to test up to 50,000 people a day once fully operational, said Matt Ashton, the city’s director of public health. He said: “We are still working on the numbers but we think [there were] about 1,500-2,000 people per testing centre, so really good numbers and really good interest, so it was very encouraging.” The scheme has drawn criticism from health experts, however, who have described it as not fit for purpose. Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University, said plans to test asymptomatic people went against advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies to prioritise testing for those who were displaying symptoms. Meanwhile, Chris Lovett, the deputy director of public health for the City of London and Hackney, said his team of six were being asked to reach people in their area whom NHS test and trace had not been able to contact. Of 700 cases transferred in the past six weeks, just under half were reached and brought into the scheme, he said. “Right at the beginning of the pandemic, our local mayor and many others did ask for local systems to take control of test and trace,” he said. “At this stage, its going to be very difficult for us to mobilise all the resources necessary to take on the full contact tracing, but certainly working in much closer partnership with local organisations, the councils, the NHS, so we can ensure this important control measure works is what we’re committed to do. “Our local residents have often said how important it has been to have that local contact, local knowledge and knowledge of what works for our communities.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1754,Travel to UK from Denmark banned amid worries over Covid in mink,11/7/20,"Travel to the UK from Denmark has been banned amid mounting concern over an outbreak in the country of a mutation of coronavirus linked to mink, the British government has announced. Downing Street had already taken action to remove Denmark from the travel corridor, forcing arrivals to quarantine for two weeks from Friday at 4am. But following a Covid committee meeting on Friday afternoon, the UK government is halting inbound travel from Denmark. All non-British national or resident travellers who have been in or transited through Denmark in the past 14 days will be denied entry into the UK. British nationals or residents returning from Denmark will be still be allowed entry into the UK. Freight and hauliers are also excluded from the ban. The rule came into force as of 4am on Saturday. Unveiling the move in a series of tweets at 2.18am on Saturday – less than two hours before the ban took effect – the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, wrote: “This decision to act quickly follows on from health authorities in Denmark reporting widespread outbreaks of coronavirus in mink farms. Keeping the UK public safe remains our top priority.” The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, is understood to be particularly concerned by developments in Denmark. It follows the discovery of a new strain of the disease in mink bred for fur in Denmark’s northern regions which has spread to humans. It is feared the new strain could prove to be more resistant against a vaccine. Anyone who has been in Denmark over the past fortnight will be asked to isolate, including their household. Meanwhile, NHS test and trace will prioritise contacting all those who have recently returned from Denmark. A spokeswoman from the Department for Transport said: “Unlike other travel to the UK, there will be no exemptions to this quarantine policy. “The UK government is working closely with international partners to understand the changes in the virus that have been reported in Denmark and we are conducting a programme of further research here in the UK to inform our risk assessments.” The travel ban and extra requirements will be reviewed after a week, the department added. Danish government experts have insisted they are acting with an “abundance of caution” in imposing restrictions in the northern Jutland region in response to the outbreak and ordering the cull of 17 million mink on its commercial farms. Several variants of Covid-19 that have infected mink have been detected in more than 200 human cases in Denmark, but it has been the one cluster of 12 cases that has caused particular concern. The country’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, had said the measures were being put in place since the mutation of the virus could potentially have an impact on the efficacy of vaccines in development, but the experts stressed on Friday there was as yet no hard evidence to suggest it would.
The World Health Organization also offered a circumspect assessment of the risk from the new mink variant. Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO’s chief scientist, said on Friday it was too early to jump to conclusions about the implications of mutations in the virus found in mink. “We need to wait and see what the implications are but I don’t think we should come to any conclusions about whether this particular mutation is going to impact vaccine efficacy,” she said. “We don’t have any evidence at the moment that it would.”
Frederiksen’s comments that the strain “could pose a risk that future vaccines won’t work”, however, attracted international attention as she called for immediate action, adding that the “eyes of the world are on us”. Dr Tyra Grove Krause of the Danish State Serum Institute told reporters on Friday that while researchers did not have “complete evidence”, they were determined to act on the information they had acquired quickly as a precaution while they continued their research.
Responding to whether recent statements and actions had generated “panic”, she added: “There is always a balance of risk. In this case … you need to act in time instead [of] waiting [to] get all the evidence. You need to act in time and stop transmission.” Frederiksen had told a news conference on Thursday: “From tonight, citizens in seven areas of north Jutland are strongly encouraged to stay in their area to prevent the spread of infection.. We are asking you in north Jutland to do something completely extraordinary. The eyes of the world are on us.” After Frederiksen’s statement, the UK government announced that Denmark would be removed from its safe travel list. The UK’s transport secretary, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, announced in an “urgent” 4am update that the country had lost its quarantine-free status. The WHO said on Friday it was looking at biosecurity in other countries where mink were farmed, adding that it was important to prevent the animals and farms becoming reservoir for the disease. Maria van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead for Covid-19, told a WHO news briefing in Geneva that the transmission of the virus between animals and humans was “a concern”, with a second expert saying the risk of such transmission was higher with mink than it was with other animals. “Mutations [in viruses] are normal. These type of changes in the virus are something we have been tracking since the beginning. We are working with regional offices … where there are mink farms, and looking at biosecurity and to prevent spillover events,” Van Kerkhove said. However, concern is centring on the fact that most mutations of the virus so far identified have been similar enough for vaccines in development to be hoped to work on them while this reportedly diverges more. While the emergence of the mutation has sparked alarm, scientists were divided over the implications for a virus that has infected dozens of species of mammals so far. • This article was amended on 7 November 2020 to replace the graph showing Covid-19 cases.

1755,"US confirms over 126,000 Covid cases on Friday, third daily record in a row",11/7/20,"The US confirmed 126,480 new coronavirus cases on Friday, a record number for a third day in a row. At the White House, the chief of staff, Mark Meadows, was reported to have tested positive for Covid-19.
On Saturday morning, Johns Hopkins University in Maryland put the total US coronavirus caseload at 9,731,198, with 235,925 deaths. The seven-day rolling average of new daily cases in the US was approaching 100,000 for the first time, while the seven-day rolling average for daily deaths had risen from 772 on 23 October to 911 on Friday. Those numbers were higher in the spring and August. States recording record daily highs on Friday included Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and Utah. News of Meadows’ test came days after he appeared with Donald Trump at a White House event at which numerous people did not wear masks. The president himself was previously treated for Covid-19, spending three days in hospital, after attending a White House event at which Covid mitigation measures were not enforced. Members of Trump’s family, senior aides and leading Republicans have all contracted the virus after attending events in Washington and on the campaign trail. On Friday, Bloomberg News said numerous Trump campaign aides had also tested positive. Last weekend, Dr Anthony Fauci, the senior US public health expert, posted a dire warning about the coming winter and the ongoing pandemic. “We’re in for a whole lot of hurt,” Fauci told the Washington Post, angering the White House. “It’s not a good situation. All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.” On Friday, across the US, states posted record numbers. In Illinois, faced with 20,000 new cases in two days, JB Pritzker, the governor, said a stay-at-home order was possible if the spread was not slowed – just before his office announced that he was self-isolating after being exposed to the virus for a third time. With a record 10,374 new infections reported on Friday and 10,000 deaths passed this week, Pritzker was asked if he would order people to stay home, as was required by Illinois and many other states in the spring. “We’re in a bad situation [but] I’m not looking at the broader mitigation of stay-at-home … as in something I would do in the coming days or a week,” he said. “But I can’t guarantee you what it looks like two weeks from now or three weeks. I just don’t know.” Kentucky reported 2,302 new cases and 10 more deaths on Friday. More than 1,000 people were hospitalised. Governor Andy Beshear urged 80 counties classified as “red zones” to follow state emergency recommendations. Last week, 68 counties were on the red-zone list. “I know we’ve been in this fight for so long that it’s easy to get numb to the scary headlines and high case numbers,” Beshear said. “That’s normal. It’s human nature. But you have to understand this is the most dangerous Covid-19 has ever been in the commonwealth and it is leading to more of our fellow Kentuckians becoming sick, being hospitalised and dying.” Kansas added a record 5,418 new cases over two days as hospitals warned of serious strain. The increases brought the state’s Covid case total to 97,633, up 5.9% from Wednesday. The state added 79 deaths to bring its total to 1,166. Deaths have more than doubled since mid-September. Kansas’s health department head, Dr Lee Norman, said cases “are just skyrocketing” because people are spending more time indoors, attending public events and family gatherings without being diligent about masks or social distancing. He said he was worried cases will spike again from Thanksgiving get-togethers, while many officials “haven’t done anything” to check the surge. In Texas, a district judge upheld an order from El Paso county’s top elected official shutting down businesses while the region fights an alarming surge in cases. The decision from Judge Bill Moody of El Paso’s 34th district court came as federal military medical teams deployed to the border region, at the request of the state.
El Paso county judge Ricardo Samaniego ordered a two-week shutdown of non-essential activities late last week. In making his decision, Moody pointed out that during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early 20th century, city and county officials had authority to respond as they “thought was necessary to protect the health and financial interests of their individual communities”. Ken Paxton, Texas’s attorney general, has argued that Samaniego’s order is illegal because it goes against Governor Greg Abbott’s statewide order to reopen businesses. Chris Hilton, an attorney with the Texas attorney general’s office, said the state would appeal against Moody’s order. El Paso joins 10 other Texas cities, including Houston, San Antonio and multiple communities in the Rio Grande Valley, to receive aid from the Department of Defense at the request of state officials.",,Foreign,Guardian,5

1773,"Very worst of the pandemic' ahead in US with no apparent strategy, experts say",11/8/20,"A lame-duck presidency and political gridlock after a bitterly fought election are set to worsen the US’s coronavirus crisis just as the pandemic enters its deadliest phase, according to health experts. With two months to go before a presidential handover from Donald Trump to Joe Biden, the federal government’s strategy for containing the virus has experts worried.
Outside of embracing conspiracy theories, Trump administration officials appear to have pinned their hopes on improved testing and eventual vaccine approval. “The strategy, if you can summarize in one word, is hope,” said Dr Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean of the Emory School of Medicine and Grady Health System in Georgia. “And hope is not a strategy.” And as Covid-19 cases surge, the economic recovery falters and coronavirus government aid runs out, the lack of a coordinated response to the pandemic during the interregnum will have serious consequences, according to experts. “We are heading into the very worst of the pandemic right now,” said Dr Megan Ranney, an emergency room doctor at Brown University who has lobbied to protect healthcare workers during the pandemic. “The degree of spread of this infection and its toll on our country is going to be, to a large extent, determined by what happens in the next two months.” The swell of autumn Covid-19 cases is already proving to be the most intense period for new infections of the entire pandemic. By various counts, the US broke a world record for new cases – 100,000 in a day – this week. Those new infections will portend new hospitalizations, and eventually deaths. Already, more than 230,000 Americans have died from Covid-19. “If we don’t do anything to stop it, we are in the trajectory going straight up,” said Del Rio. Del Rio predicted the United States could see 200,000 cases a day by Thanksgiving, if Americans do not adopt social distancing and universal masking immediately. There are other grim signs. The nursing home industry, which cares for America’s most medically fragile residents, has warned that Covid-19 cases among the elderly and infirm are growing because of intense spread in surrounding communities. “It is incredibly frustrating,” said Mark Parkinson, president and CEO of the American Health Care Association, an industry group for private nursing homes. “If everybody would wear a mask and social distance to reduce the level of Covid in the community, we know we would dramatically reduce these rates in long-term care facilities.” Nursing homes house less than 1% of the population, but represent more than 40% of deaths. Hospital administrators are scaling back non-urgent, but medically necessary, surgeries which serve as one of their largest sources of profit. State governments in the upper midwest are setting up field hospitals, but staffing will be difficult with increased spread and worker burnout.
At the same time, the appetite for further Covid-19 restrictions is almost nil, as weary Americans head into a fall holiday season traditionally marked by celebrations indoors with family and friends. “Thanksgiving is basically set up to be a chain reaction of super-spreader events across our country. And if this is happening across the country, we’re not going to have [traveling health workers] or extra staffers,” said Ranney, even as “everyone is needed in their own hospitals or their own communities”. Nationwide hotspots could also bring shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). While supply chains are more robust than they were in April and March, resources are still limited because hospitals and states now stockpile PPE. Dr Shikhah Gupta, executive director of Get Us PPE, the physician-founded non-profit aimed at providing PPE to workers, said the group was “preparing for the worst”. “One of the biggest trends we’re seeing is people are really ready to pretend the [pandemic] is over,” said Gupta. At the same time, the economic recovery appears to be faltering as businesses run out of pandemic relief aid and the virus spreads widely. Economist Chris Rupkey told Reuters the slowing recovery appeared to show, “a second wave of layoffs is hitting the economy, perhaps due to the rising count of virus cases”. At the same time, some businesses may have never been able to fully reopen “and [are] facing bankruptcy”. “The goal has to be control of the virus so the economy can succeed,” said Del Rio. “It’s not just about health, it’s about the economy and ensuring people have jobs.” The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said he hoped to accelerate the timetable for a new coronavirus stimulus package, and aimed to pass the bill before Biden’s inauguration. He called it “job one” when Congress returns. But it remains unclear how Trump will react to new proposals while he is still in power. No experts the Guardian spoke with expect the kind of broad intervention needed to change the course of the pandemic. Instead, any response will need to come from Americans themselves. “When I look at how our country is going to make it through, between now and inauguration day,” said Ranney, “it’s really going to depend on that continued willingness of Americans to step up.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1774,Wiped off the map': tiny Italian villages cower from Covid threat,11/8/20,"When the mayor of Roccafiorita received a phone call in October informing him that an employee in his office had tested positive for Covid-19, his heart sank. Set among the forests at the foot of Mount Kalfa, Roccafiorita is the smallest village in southern Italy. The average age of its 187 inhabitants is over 60. If Covid were to spread among the population, the village could disappear. “When the phone rang, it was like lightning on a sunny day”, said Concetto Orlando, the mayor. “With this second wave on its way, for a second I thought that we might actually be wiped off the map.”
Last week, the Italian government introduced a semi-lockdown to combat the spread of coronavirus, after an average of over 30,000 new cases a day. Most attention has been directed towards large cities like Milan and Naples, but across the country thousands of small villages are fighting to stay alive. Of Italy’s 8,000 villages, towns and cities, almost 70% have fewer than 5,000 inhabitants. Two thousand have fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, and in some places the birth of a baby is so rare that the village bells toll to celebrate the news. Dozens of these villages have been declared coronavirus “red zones” – meaning the risk of infection is particularly high and people cannot leave or enter.
“Demographic desertification had already affected these towns before Covid,” said Mario Alvano, secretary general of the National Association of Italian Municipalities in Sicily. “These are tiny villages that were already destined to become ghost towns in a few decades, where the birth rate is 30 times lower than the death rate. Now Covid risks accelerating their demise.” Salvatore Occhino, born and raised in Roccafiorita, may never have imagined that after the second world war another terrifying experience would be in store for him, this time in the shape of a pandemic. Occhino is a living monument in the town, not only because at 93 he is its oldest person, but above all because despite his age, he continues to tend to his fields.
“I’m worried,” he said. “If Covid strikes hard, there will be no one left in Roccafiorita. My heart cries out when I think of all the sacrifices we’ve made to keep this village alive. Now we can only place ourselves in the Lord’s hands.” In at least four regions, Covid-19 has struck small villages, including Galati Mamertino in Sicily, which was designated a red zone on 1 November after 157 of its 2,400 inhabitants tested positive. Experts agree that outbreaks of this sort are the result of the close proximity among townspeople, which is typical of social life in these areas. “In tiny villages, relations among relatives and friends are intense,” said Tullio Prestileo, a doctor of infectious diseases at the Benfratelli hospital in Palermo. “Here the impression that a friend or relative can infect us is much lower than in large cities. It’s often believed that the isolated location of these villages is itself a form of protection against transmission, and that the problem is an urban one. That’s why when an outbreak occurs in these towns, the transmission is more widespread.” After the second world war, Roccafiorita began a trend of depopulation as many of its inhabitants left for the US in search of employment. In 2020, three people died and one child was born in Roccafiorita.
The phenomenon is not limited to rural areas – births nationwide are at an all-time low since the unification of Italy. For the first time in 90 years, the Italian population (excluding the foreign population) has fallen to about 55 million, according to the national statistics agency. Globally, Italy ranks behind only Japan in the proportion of older people among the general population. The result has been a rise in the number of ghost towns, where the majority of homes are abandoned. In Roccafiorita, 40% of homes are uninhabited. Over the years, in an attempt to resuscitate these small towns, mayors have adopted various strategies. Some villages have opened the doors of vacant houses to asylum seekers. Others are practically giving away abandoned homes to anyone who wants to move in.
Last year, the mayor of Sambuca – population 5,000 – received more than 94,000 emails from around the world after publicly announcing the sale of abandoned homes for €1. Sambuca, in the province of Agrigento, has just been declared a “red zone”, after an outbreak caused 130 positive cases and eight deaths. “The sale of our homes for €1 was a symbolic gesture to bring people back to Sambuca, because villages are made of people, not houses,” said the deputy mayor, Giuseppe Cacioppo. “Believe me, the loss of one person in an ageing, small town is felt more deeply here than in the cities.” “The death of one our own isn’t just a number,” said Fabio Orlando, the chairman of the city council in Roccafiorita. “It’s a loss of history, a house that becomes abandoned, and a pathway that is closed and forgotten forever.” Fortunately the threat of an outbreak in Roccafiorita has been averted, for now. A recent round of swab tests carried out on the entire population all came back negative. On 4 November, Rome designated Sicily as an “orange zone”, at high risk, mainly because of the lack of health facilities and beds in intensive care units. The small towns have paid the highest price for cost-cutting in the health system in the south, where more than 40 hospitals have closed in recent years.
The closest Covid hospital is more than 1 hour and 40 minutes from Roccafiorita. From the perspective of the village, the light at the end of the tunnel seems far off. The village’s elderly inhabitants hope for a vaccine. But Salvatore Occhino knows a long and arduous winter lies ahead. He says it in his own way, in a recent poem. It’s about how Roccafiorita has changed, how the streets were once dark, and now they’re lit. It ends like this: “Ora vi saluto tutti, Buonasera / Chi sopravviverà lo vedremo in Primavera” (“I now bid you all farewell, good evening. Those who survive we’ll see in spring”)",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1775,Appointment of WTO chief in doubt after key meeting cancelled,11/8/20,"The race to find a new leader of the World Trade Organization has been thrown into renewed uncertainty after the cancellation of a key appointment meeting following the US presidential election. The Geneva-based WTO, which acts as an international arbiter for trading disputes, said it had put off a meeting scheduled for Monday that had been called to appoint Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as its next director general. Donald Trump’s administration opposed her selection in one of its final acts before the US election, despite the former Nigerian finance minister securing the overwhelming backing of the WTO’s 164 members. The special meeting of the trade body’s general council had been convened to take a formal decision on the appointment. Officials had been set to put forward Dr Okonjo-Iweala as the candidate most likely to attract a majority, after most countries expressed a preference for her over South Korea’s Yoo Myung-hee. Okonjo-Iweala had moved a step closer to becoming the first woman and the first African to be director of the global trade watchdog after securing backing from the EU, China, Japan and Australia. Liam Fox, the leading Brexiter and former international trade secretary, had run as the UK government’s preferred candidate but failed to win enough support from other countries to reach the last two in the process. Trade experts said Joe Biden defeating Trump in last week’s election may have led to countries calling for a delay in the WTO leadership race, with the aim of securing the Biden White House’s backing for Okonjo-Iweala after he takes charge in January. The delay in selecting a new WTO director general comes at a fragile moment for the world economy amid the second wave of Covid-19, and after years of criticism of the WTO and calls for reform from Trump.
The WTO said the meeting would be postponed until further notice, during which time the organisation would continue undertaking consultations with delegations from countries around the world to pick a new leader. It said in a statement: “For reasons including the health situation and current events, delegations will not be in a position to take a formal decision on 9 November.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1776,‘Are you from Wales?’ Wrexham braced for influx of people fleeing England lockdown,11/8/20,"For centuries, its proximity to the border made Wrexham in north Wales a focus of tension and conflict. From Monday, the town’s geographical position means a very 2020 set of challenges will face the authorities and business people. The 17-day Covid Welsh “firebreak” ends and the town’s shops, pubs, cafes and restaurants will be permitted to reopen. By then, the month-long lockdown in England – just five miles away – will be four days old and some English residents may be ready to illegally skip across the border to shop and have a drink or meal out.
“It’s bound to happen,” said Matt McHale, who runs the La Baguette sandwich shop close to the train station. “The border is so close. Chester is only 25 minutes away and Liverpool isn’t very far. I don’t see how the police will be able to stop people crossing.” Mark Finlay, the operations manager for pubs and bars including the Fat Boar in Wrexham, said they would be asking people for ID and turning them away if they were not supposed to be in Wales. “We’ll be asking the question ‘Are you from Wales?’ and giving them a form to put their name and address on. If they are prepared to lie to have a drink of beer, more fool them.” Finlay reckons staff will be able to spot incomers. “We know our regulars. Chester isn’t that far away but they are quite different people.” The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said this week the different timings of the two versions of lockdown for Wales and England meant the border was probably the hardest it had been for hundreds of years – but he feared English residents might use Welsh hospitality businesses to “escape” the regime they are living under. He flagged up Wrexham, the largest town in north Wales. “Think of Wrexham and Chester, just a few miles apart,” he said. “If pubs are closed in Chester [as they were as of Thursday], what impact will that have on people trying to travel to Wales?” The Welsh economy minister, Ken Skates, suggested the different regimes could be a boom time for places such as Wrexham, pointing out that Welsh residents would not be crossing the border to shop. “Hospitality businesses, non-essential retail in Wales will have a captive market,” he said. “That is something they surely will be able to celebrate for four weeks during which their equivalents in England are in lockdown.”
If that does happen, it will be a huge relief to businesses in the town. Colin Turnbull, a taxi driver, said it had been almost impossible to make a living during the firebreak. “We’ve been taking perhaps a tenth of our normal fares,” he said. People are still allowed to travel into Wales from England and vice versa for essential reasons, such as work and education. Turnbull said he would not be quizzing passengers about their reasons for being in Wrexham. “That’s not our job,” he said. “We aren’t the police.” Andy Gallanders, who runs the Bank Street Social coffee shop, said he thought people were getting tired of lockdown and would cross the border. But it was not a one-way problem, he said. During the Wales firebreak he knew of people who went from Wrexham to Chester for a night out when English pubs and restaurants were still open.
“I believe we’ll see the reverse now with people coming over from Chester. The onus seems to be on owners and operators to police it, which is very difficult. People won’t stop coming just because Drakeford says they shouldn’t.” Wayne Price, the chair of the town forum, said he expected the first days post-firebreak could be quiet – but it would build. He said he expected people would defy the regulations and travel from England – and it would be hard for the ban to be enforced. “We’re a border town. We have Welsh, English, Portuguese, Polish people living here, a beautiful hotchpotch of different cultures. You can’t always tell if someone is from Liverpool or Wrexham.” North Wales police will not be setting up roadblocks on the border. There are too many crossing places even if it was inclined to do so. But there will be more patrols on the strategic routes in and out and officers on foot in town centres.
The police and crime commissioner for north Wales, Arfon Jones, said officers would use the “four E’s” – engage, educate, encourage – and as a last-resort enforce. He urged people not to cross the border for a drink or shopping trip. “If police do come across someone who has travelled to a place like Wrexham for a drink when they shouldn’t, they will take action. People shouldn’t come on shopping trips. “We’re trying to stop the spread of a deadly virus. People need to take personal responsibility. Wait until the lockdown in England ends. There will still be time for Christmas shopping then.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1777,Art as resistance: exiled Kurdish artist’s daring Istanbul show,11/8/20,"An exiled artist who spent almost three years in jail in Turkey is shining a light on Kurdish feminism with a daring exhibition of works she created while behind bars. Zehra Doğan was among the thousands of people who have been caught up in arrests and detentions in Turkey since the 2016 attempted coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government. Those detained are accused of either supporting the Gülenist movement, blamed for the failed putsch, or the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), a militant group, both of which are outlawed. She was jailed for a painting depicting a town in the majority-Kurdish south-east of the country that was destroyed in a Turkish military operation after peace talks between Ankara and the PKK broke down in 2015.
The painting, together with her work as a journalist, led to a sentence of two years and 10 months for terrorist propaganda and inciting hatred. On her release last year, the 31-year-old left the country, and fears she will be unable to return. “In prison, I had two choices: either to accept it, and complain, or to try to continue with my art as a means of resistance,” she said. Turkish and Kurdish writers have long found their voices in prison, whereas the work of visual artists, cut off from materials and mediums, has suffered. With no paper, Doğan used newspaper, cardboard and clothes as canvases. For paint, she found that crushed herbs made green, kale was a substitute for purple, and pomegranate or menstrual blood could be used for red. Blue ballpoint pen, cigarette ash, coffee grounds, pepper and turmeric make up much of the rest of her prison palette. The result is a striking series of works that were smuggled out of her cell as dirty laundry, now on display at the Kıraathane24 art space in Istanbul as Not Approved, her first solo exhibition in Turkey.
Women’s faces and bodies, along with Shahmaran, the half-woman, half-snake of Kurdish mythology, feature prominently. Drawn or painted on scarves and cloth, they are depicted as bound up in rope made from human hair, faces twisted in pain from childbirth or menstruation framed by traditional Kurdish clothing and jewellery. In one piece, Womanhood, ghost-like female faces with no hair stare at the observer from the skirts of a coffee-stained dress hung from a curtain rail. It is pinned up in such a way that it looks as if an invisible wearer is dancing through the air. The exhibition has been well received by both critics and the public. But despite its success, Kurdish art in Turkey is still struggling to find a platform. The ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) took steps to improve cultural and linguistic rights for Turkey’s 18% Kurdish minority in 2009, leading to the flourishing of Kurdish media outlets and the establishment of the first Kurdish-language university department at Artuklu in Mardin. Since talks with the PKK collapsed, however, many Kurdish politicians, including the leader of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic party (HDP) Selahattin Demirtaş have been removed from office and imprisoned, and media and cultural projects have been shut down.
The latest victim was Bêrû, a Kurdish-language adaptation of the Italian play Trumpets and Raspberries by the Nobel laureate Dario Fo, which was cancelled by local administrators just hours before opening night in October. It had been billed as the first Kurdish-language production by the Istanbul Municipality City theatre in its 106-year history. Şener Özmen, a Kurdish artist and writer, said: “Kurdish artists, those who express themselves as Kurdish and are not afraid of that identity, face more and more disappointing difficulties today. Kurdish is still a language that can be banned and is banned. “A growing issue is theatres, institutions and gallery owners basically suggesting the artists censor themselves [in order not to attract trouble].”
Doğan is more optimistic. From afar, she is helping organise workshops for young Kurdish artists and is collaborating with the Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei in Switzerland soon. Now out of prison, and outside Turkey, the artist says she is focusing on larger systems of entrapment created by borders. “There is always room for improvement but the Kurdish art scene is changing rapidly at the moment and there is a wave of creative new artists,” she said. “Kurds have been fighting for our rights for 100 years now. Some choose to fight with weapons. We need to learn to fight through other means. For me, that is art.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1778,Aung San Suu Kyi expected to keep power in Myanmar election,11/8/20,"Voters across Myanmar have gone to the polls for an election that is expected to return to power the party of Aung San Suu Kyi, who remains hugely popular at home despite allegations of a genocide that have destroyed her reputation abroad. Queues of people waited in line, in some cases for hours, to cast their ballots on Sunday in the country’s second general election since the end of full military rule. Most were wearing masks as a precaution against the coronavirus. The country has confirmed more than 60,000 infections, the majority of which were reported since mid-August. Aung San Suu Kyi is expected to hold on to power, even as the country struggles with the coronavirus pandemic, a spiralling conflict in Rakhine state and faces genocide charges at the UN’s top court. Five years since her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), won a landslide victory, Aung San Suu Kyi retains strong support among the Bamar majority, who revere her as a protector of democracy. While the brutal crackdown on Rohingya Muslims appalled many abroad, there is little sympathy for their plight domestically, and it has not been a factor in election campaigns. In a Facebook video posted on Thursday, Aung San Suu Kyi urged people to go out and cast their ballot. “Every single voter is writing their own history, this election’s history and our country’s history,” she said. About 38 million people were eligible to go to the polls, including 5 million first-time voters. “I’m not at all afraid of being infected with Covid-19,” Khine Zar Chi, 27, told Agence France-Presse, as she voted for the first time in downtown Yangon. “I don’t care if I die for Mother Suu.” Others, however, accuse Aung San Suu Kyi of failing to deliver on the democratic reforms promised in 2015, or the pledge to bring peace and reconciliation. Voting was cancelled in several areas dominated by ethnic minorities, ostensibly due to security concerns over fighting between the army and armed groups that are calling for greater autonomy. It’s feared the decision, which has left an estimated 1.5 million people disenfranchised, will entrench resentment, and fuel conflict. Analysts point out that voting has been stopped even in areas where fighting is limited. Rohingya Muslims, who have long been denied citizenship, are still without voting rights. Most are stuck in squalid camps in Bangladesh, where they fled an army crackdown in 2017. Hundreds of thousands remain confined to camps and villages inside Myanmar’s Rakhine state, where Human Rights Watch has reported abuses that it says amount to the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution. On Friday, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, raised concern over the “legal limbo” facing Rohingya in Myanmar, and their inability to vote. “It is important that everyone have a voice and be able to participate in these elections in a very … inclusive way,” UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. The government-appointed election commission has been criticised not only over voter exclusion, but also for a lack of transparency, discrimination against Muslim candidates and logistical problems.
Last week, in a rare interview, the commander-in-chief, Min Aung Hlaing, accused the civilian government of “unacceptable mistakes” in the run-up to the election and described the army as the “guardian” of the nation. He has since said he will accept the results of the vote. A quarter of parliamentary seats are reserved for the military, which has ruled in an uneasy alliance with the NLD over the past five years. It remains extremely powerful and has blocked proposals to change the constitution and therefore reduce its influence. About 90 parties are competing with the NLD, though campaigning was hampered in some areas due to the coronavirus pandemic. It’s believed this will mostly disadvantage smaller, ethnic-based parties, which lack access to state media. It was feared the pandemic could also deter people from going to polling stations, but on Sunday morning analysts reported a strong turnout. Lines of people have waited for two hours to vote in downtown Yangon, said Khin Zaw Win, the director of Tampadipa Institute in Yangon. “The Myanmar electorate doesn’t need to be prodded,” he said, adding that there has, historically, long been a recognition of the importance of elections. “Add to that the half-century of democracy denial under the military, and people know voting is the best chance they have,” he said. But he added that politicians have persistently let the public down. “There have been waves of reforms but not enough, and not in critical sectors like land tenure, citizenship and religious freedoms. And corruption is always there, hanging like a pall.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1779,Biden win plus no-deal Brexit could leave Johnson in a 'lonely place in the world',11/8/20,"Boris Johnson faces a catastrophe in terms of future relations with Washington if he pursues a no-deal Brexit, the former head of the Foreign Office and a succession of ex-ambassadors have said. The calls add pressure on the UK to revise its internal market bill, currently in the Lords, that includes clauses enabling the UK to breach international law and set up a hard border on the island of Ireland, a move deeply opposed by Joe Biden’s foreign policy team. Johnson congratulated Biden on his victory on Saturday evening. But Dominic Raab said “some processes still needed to be complete” in an oblique reference to Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results in the courts. Speaking on Sky TV, the UK foreign secretary avoided answering when asked: “Do you think all votes should be counted in a democratic election?” But overall it was a blow to Trump that his closest personal transatlantic ally had endorsed Biden’s victory before any formal concession statement from the White House.
The British endorsement followed four days of Foreign Office silence, contrasting with calls from the German foreign ministry for Trump to tone down his claims the election had been stolen. Some of Biden’s allies – not official aides – made clear their hostility towards Johnson, regarded by certain Democrats as a shallow mini-Trump populist willing to use lies to pursue nationalist and divisive goals. After Johnson congratulated Biden, Tommy Vietor, a former Obama press aide and now a leading figure on the influential Pod Save America franchise, referred to the prime minister’s previous comments about Barack Obama’s “part-Kenyan” heritage. “This shapeshifting creep weighs in,” he tweeted. “We will never forget your racist comments about Obama and slavish devotion to Trump.” Biden, a Catholic with strong moral views and deep foreign policy experience, is not a natural soulmate for Johnson, and the two men have never met. But Biden’s allies said he is by instinct a bridge-builder prepared to work across the aisle, suggesting he would give the UK prime minister a chance. The importance of alliances, after all, is one of Biden’s foundational principles. Downing Street is banking on the importance of the intelligence relationship, and a close common agenda on issues ranging from the climate crisis, the Iran nuclear deal, modernising the Nato defence alliance and a continued ideological pushback against China and Russia. Downing Street’s foreign policy chief, Prof John Bew, is also a past participant in the D10, an informal multilateral grouping of democracies that has echoes in Biden’s plans for a summit of democracies. The UK chairs the big UN climate crisis summit and G7 this year, and UK aides see opportunities for a way of meshing Biden’s summit and the concept of a D10. No 10 will also welcome the US back into active engagement in multilateral organisations such as the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organisztion and the UN human rights council. The UK will also be hoping that the US will pledge to make any coronavirus vaccine available to all. Figures such as the former head of M16 Sir John Sawers claim British diplomacy has been adrift around the world because of the absence of consistency and values from its first partner. But Johnson is being urged by diplomats to recognise that pursuit of a no-deal Brexit will be regarded as a serious error by the US, and undermine this wider agenda. Sir Simon Fraser, the foreign office permanent secretary until 2015, said Biden’s rise was “problematic for our government. This is a government that was born of the disruption of Brexit in 2016 just as Trumpism was a reflection of that. Trump supported Brexit. My understanding is the relationship between London and the Biden team is not that strong.”
Speaking at Chatham House, he added: “The British government will be looking for areas where it can have influence with Washington and with Europe, and to find a role. If we have a no-deal Brexit with a Biden administration, it is going to be a catastrophe for that agenda so I hope the government realises that it redoubles the argument for some sort of deal if the UK wants to have some sort of influence … We will shoot ourselves in the foot both in Washington and Brussels and beyond Brussels if we pursue a no-deal Brexit option.” The former UK ambassador to the US, Sir Nigel Sheinwald also said Biden regarded Brexit as a significant mistake. “After a Biden victory, and a failure to reach a trade deal with the EU, the UK would occupy a lonely place in the world,” he said. A UK-EU trade deal is seen by the Biden team as symbolic of the UK’s willingness to cooperate with rather than disrupt the EU. Only last week the EU set out proposals for how the UK and other third parties could join EU defence projects. Johann Wadephul, deputy chair of the CDU foreign affairs group, also urged the UK to lift its sights. He said: “Great Britain has to realise that it would be good for the Brexit negotiations to be finished because the Biden administration will concentrate more on the EU, and the more we are aligned together, the better it would be better for both for the US and for Europe.” Biden, proud of his Irish ancestral roots and close to the Irish diplomatic machine, has said any Brexit that threatened the Good Friday agreement by hardening borders within Ireland would end the chance of a UK-US bilateral trade deal. Kori Schake, foreign policy lead at the American Enterprise Institute said Biden was anyway unlikely to see a prospective deal as a top priority. “My advice to the UK is to join the transpacific trade partnership and get what they want from the US market that way.” The UK is also aware that the EU is preparing to offer its own partnership with the Biden team, one that risks brushing the UK to one side. The German government is likely to be Biden’s first interlocutor, according to Kim Darroch, the previous UK ambassador to the US. Fraser said: “I expect when he is working with Europe, Biden will probably look to France and Germany. So the UK, despite our deep and instinctive relationships – which are very powerful – is going to have to work hard to forge a relationship in a new context.” The UK’s relative influence may depend partly on whether the EU can resolve its own internal differences and make a coherent offer to the US on defence, trade and China. There will be relief across Europe according to Dominique Moïsi, special adviser to Institut Montaigne. He said: “Trump’s tactical bullying will be replaced by strategic empathy – the natural style of Biden.” But many in Europe believe the US has fundamentally changed in the past decade, shown by the record turnout for Trump last Tuesday, and as a result the foundations of the old transatlantic alliance is dead. Benjamin Haddad, director of the Future Europe Initiative at the Atlantic Council, said: “To European leaders who still question European strategic autonomy [the ability to act alone if necessary], do you really believe the decision of a few thousand voters in Pennsylvania should decide the security of your citizens every four years?” Others, especially in Germany, believe the US alliance remains indispensable to Europe, and autonomy is a pipe dream. The German foreign ministry immediately issued a statement saying it planned to make an offer to revive the transatlantic partnership and would put forward concrete proposals on “how we can close ranks as an international community be it with regard to players such as China climate change protection and the global fight against Covid-19”. Germany will be pressing for Biden to lift tariffs on steel and cars as a symbol of a new start, but Biden will be wary. Although US public attitudes to trade liberalisation are changing, his industrial and trade platform “Made in America” has superficial echoes of Trump’s “America First”. But the biggest test of transatlantic relations is likely to come over China. Through the use of extraterritorial sanctions and regulations, Trump bullied most of Europe into ejecting the Chinese government-backed Huawei from its 5G networks. But there was always a fear that any moment the US president might turn on a dime, seal a bilateral trade deal with Xi Jinping and ditch his purely performative concern about human rights in Hong Kong, Britain’s old colony. Fraser describes the rise of China as the greatest collective strategic challenge facing the alliance, an issue that requires greater clarity from the US. He argues European trade officials would like nothing more than to work with the US on a policy towards China in the WTO, but cooperation is made near impossible by the US slapping tariffs on Europe. He says the UK is also not yet in a position “to balance out the tremendous geopolitical strategic risks of China with the economic opportunity and imperative to engage with China. We do not have the policy mechanism to work that through.” But constructing any policy mechanism in any field was always an act of faith in the Trump era. His thinking – “like an archipelago of dots” according to John Bolton, his former national security adviser – meant any policy was near impossible to create, or discern. With the return of the foreign policy professionals to the US Department of State, the UK at least has some adults with whom to converse.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1780,Bolivia's new leftwing president: 'We have reclaimed democracy',11/8/20,"Bolivia’s new president, Luis Arce, has vowed to rebuild his country’s battered economy, revive ties with leftwing neighbours and serve one term only, as he prepared to take office after October’s landslide election. Speaking to the Guardian before his inauguration on Sunday, the UK-educated economist was cautious about characterising his victory as proof that Latin America’s leftwing “pink tide” of the early 2000s was bouncing back after a period of rightwing dominance. Since 2018 the left has returned to power in Mexico and Argentina, while a leftwing economist is well placed to win Ecuador’s presidential election in February.
But Arce’s win did represent a sensational domestic resurrection for the Movement for Socialism (Mas) party, which some observers thought was doomed after its figurehead, Evo Morales, was driven abroad last year after a failed election, social unrest and what supporters call a US-backed coup. “The left is not defeated in Bolivia – on the contrary, we have a new opportunity now to work for the Bolivian people,” the incoming president said.
Arce, 57, said his emphatic first-round win showed Latin Americans would no longer accept anti-democratic, rightwing regimes, such as the interim government that took power after Morales abandoned Bolivia in November 2019. “We have reclaimed democracy for Bolivia, and our message is that we will not tolerate any kind of de facto dictatorial regime or coup in Latin America,” he said, promising to seek justice for the victims of a shooting of unarmed civilians at the height of last year’s unrest. He promised to repair ties with Argentina’s Peronist leaders and restore relations with the leftwing governments of Cuba and Venezuela, which Bolivia’s conservative interim president, Jeanine Áñez, severed, despite lacking a democratic mandate. He said Juan Guaidó, the Trump-backed Venezuelan opposition leader who has been trying to topple Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, since declaring himself the country’s rightful leader in January 2019, “represents no one”.
But Arce also signalled he would be pragmatic, “leaving matters of ideology and politics to one side” when dealing with leaders of different stripes, such as Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. “We want to do good business with our neighbours,” he said. On Sunday morning thousands of supporters gathered outside the legislative assembly in La Paz to see Arce sworn in. As Bolivia’s green, yellow and red presidential sash was placed over his shoulders, they chanted their new leader’s nickname: “Lucho! Lucho! Lucho! Lucho!” Guests included Argentina’s leftwing leader Alberto Fernández and Venezuela’s foreign minister Jorge Arreaza. But the conservative presidents of Colombia and Paraguay, Iván Duque and Mario Abdo Benítez, also flew in. “We are starting a new phase in our history,” Arce told them, promising to govern “for all” Bolivia’s people.
Experts see a bumpy road ahead for Arce, with Bolivia still reeling from the humanitarian and economic impact of one of the world’s worst coronavirus outbreaks. Its Covid-19 death rate per million people is currently the fifth highest in the world, higher than that of the US and Mexico. “I wouldn’t expect any kind of honeymoon,” said Eduardo Gamarra, a Bolivia expert at Florida International University. He said painful austerity measures with the potential to cause “social turmoil” were unavoidable. Arce, who has a master’s from Warwick University, where he studied in the 90s on a British government scholarship, said the economic outlook was bleak, with GDP falling 11% this year and unemployment as high as 30% in sectors such as construction. “The first thing we must do is get Bolivia out of this economic crisis. The great majority of Latin America countries are suffering from this right now, but particularly Bolivia … So we must rebuild the economy.” Arce faces political tests too, not least in the shape of Morales, who is planning a triumphant homecoming from exile in Argentina on Monday. “His big challenge now is how long he can keep Evo out of the picture,” Gamarra said.
Asked whether it was the right moment for Morales to return, Arce said: “He will make that decision. We won’t interfere in his decisions … and of course we will not stop him … It’s a very personal matter for him.” However, Morales would have no formal role in his administration, Arce said. “This is my government. Comrade Evo is the Mas president and that will be his role … But I will lead the government.”
Morales caused anger last year, even in Mas, for ignoring a referendum and seeking a fourth term in an attempt to extend his 14 years in power. Arce said he did not plan to remain in office as long, and hoped to see a “renewal” of his party with the emergence of a new generation of leaders. “I want to spend five years [in office] and no more,” he said. Jim Shultz, the founder of the Bolivia-focused Democracy Center, said that was not necessarily how things would turn out. “Let’s see what happens, because the constitution gives him the option of a second [term],” he said. “Of course he would say that at the beginning.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1781,Boris Johnson under pressure to avoid no-deal Brexit after Biden victory,11/8/20,"Boris Johnson will be under even greater pressure to strike a Brexit deal with Brussels when Joe Biden enters the White House, senior Tories and diplomats said on Saturday, amid fears that a no-deal outcome could seriously threaten relations with a new Democratic administration. The Foreign Office and No 10 are urgently trying to assess the implications for UK foreign policy of a Biden presidency, including in areas such as Brexit, climate change, the Middle East, China and Nato. But after a phone call on Saturday between Johnson and European commission president Ursula von der Leyen ended with Downing Street saying “significant differences remain in a number of areas”, fears were growing that both sides could be slipping towards no deal. Pro-EU Tories and diplomats are concerned that a no-deal outcome would cause early and serious tension between London and Washington and put the special relationship at risk, given Biden’s stated opposition to Brexit, support for European integration and support for the Good Friday Agreement. Biden, who has Irish ancestry, has made it clear that there will be no agreement on a post-Brexit UK-US trade deal if a no-deal outcome threatens the Good Friday agreement that he holds dear. His concerns over the threat to the agreement in the event of a no-deal Brexit reached new heights after Johnson recently forced through the internal market bill. Many saw the move as putting Brexit above the interests of peace in Ireland. Senior Tories and other senior pro-EU figures in Whitehall also point out that a UK-US trade deal after Brexit could be less likely under Biden than it would have been under Trump. Senior diplomats believe Biden might even prioritise an US-EU trade deal over one with the UK, as he tries to repair relations with the 27-nation bloc that were badly damaged by the actions of Donald Trump. On Saturday night one of Johnson’s former cabinet colleagues, Baroness Nicky Morgan, said that while in many respects Biden could prove a better ally than Trump in areas of UK foreign policy such as Nato, the Middle East and climate change, the thorny matter of Brexit would have to be dealt with very carefully. Taking into account Biden’s warnings on Northern Irish peace, Morgan said: “I think the PM will not want the first conversation he has with Biden to be about Northern Ireland, Brexit and no deal. Getting a deal will make that conversation much easier.” The former cabinet minister Damian Green added: “A deal is better than a no deal for all sorts of reasons. But a Biden White House would be much more receptive to a UK-US deal if we already had one with the EU.” Both Brussels and No 10 made it clear yesterday that Brexit negotiations remained stuck following the call between Von der Leyen and Johnson before a decisive week of talks, even as tentative signs emerged of agreement around a five-year transition period on fishing rights. The European commission president and the prime minister both highlighted in their post-call statements the contentious issues of EU access to British waters and agreement on future rules to ensure fair competition. Von der Leyen tweeted that “some progress has been made, but large differences remain” with just over a week remaining before parliamentary ratification on a trade and security deal will need to begin.
A statement from Downing Street emphasised the need to “redouble efforts” when the two sides, led by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his British counterpart David Frost, re-engaged on Monday. “The prime minister set out that, while some progress had been made in recent discussions, significant differences remain in a number of areas, including the so-called level playing field and fish,” a Downing Street spokesman said following Saturday’s call. “The prime minister and president agreed that their negotiating teams would continue talks in London next week, beginning on Monday, in order to redouble efforts to reach a deal.” The negotiations are entering a decisive phase. But Barnier privately warned last week that the talks were not on a “trajectory” for a deal, telling MEPs that the coming week offered the last opportunity for common ground to be found. It is understood, however, that there are tentative signs of agreement on a five-year transition period on fisheries. Barnier has told diplomats that the “gap” on fishing is big regarding quotas and that “access to the 6-12 mile fishing zone” remains a sticking point for France and Ireland, who point to their fishing fleets operating in those stretch of seas for centuries. One source said the EU was seeking to help Johnson to overcome his political problems at home in order to get the deal over the line, but that the gaps in terms of quotas remained too big as yet for Brussels to be able to start selling the deal to the member states. In Brussels, the greatest concern is the lack of progress on the issues of standards and domestic subsidies, or state aid. The EU has proposed high-level principles on state subsidies to which both sides would agree. The UK would also establish an independent competition authority and there would be a dispute settlement mechanism with both sides able to take swift retaliatory action during an arbitration period if there was a clear breach of the rules. Downing Street has suggested, however, that the threshold for unilateral action needs to be a clear impact on trade from a subsidy rather than a mere risk. Meanwhile on the issue of standards, the UK has agreed to non-regression from current environmental, labour and social regulations but there has been a clash over how the two sides will develop their laws over time. “We are nowhere”, said one source.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1782,"Covid set to cause 400,000 surge in TB deaths as medics diverted",11/8/20,"Scientists have warned that several hundred thousand extra deaths from tuberculosis are likely to occur this year as a result of Covid-19’s effect on global health services. In many countries – including South Africa, India and Indonesia – doctors and health workers have been shifted from tracking TB cases to tracing people infected with Covid-19. Equipment and budgets have also been reassigned, an investigation by the World Health Organisation (WHO) has revealed. As a result, millions of TB diagnoses have been missed, and according to the WHO this is likely to result in 200,000 to 400,000 excess deaths from the disease this year alone, with a further million new cases occurring every year after that for the next five years. “This is just one example of the very difficult choices that had to be taken to contain Covid-19,” said Thomas Kenyon, chief health officer of Project Hope, the humanitarian NGO. “It was obviously crucial that we tackle the pandemic but we cannot forget that we have other killers in our midst. We are going to have to be innovative in addressing them.” TB is the world’s leading cause of death from infectious disease, topping both HIV and malaria. It is contagious and is caused by a bacterium known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which commonly attacks the lungs but can affect any part of the body, from the bloodstream to the brain. Humanity has lived with the threat of TB for millennia. The ancient Egyptians knew of its dangers and it is believed that Nefertiti and her Pharaoh husband Akhenaten both died from tuberculosis in around 1330 BC. In modern times TB has become a global scourge and it is believed that about 10 million people are infected with the disease each year, while about 1.5 million people die from it. The WHO says the planet is now in the grip of global TB epidemic, which it has pledged to defeat by 2030. The condition can be treated using a six-month drug regime – provided a diagnosis is made in time. Major efforts to contain the disease began in 2015. At first, efforts to contain it were successful and the number of deaths began to fall. This decline has slowed recently. One problem has been the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of TB, particularly in nations that made up the former Soviet Union. With the arrival of Covid-19, the global battle against TB received a further setback. According to the WHO, problems have arisen not just because key staff have been reallocated from TB tracing to Covid testing but also because critically important equipment and materials have been redeployed. In addition, some countries have cut inpatient and outpatient care for TB sufferers. A particular problem has arisen in relation to a test called GeneXpert, which is efficient at identifying the molecular signature of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in people with TB. The test is also very good at identifying individuals who have Covid-19. “Many countries have changed to using GeneXpert machines for Covid-19 testing instead of diagnostic testing for TB,” reported WHO, which said it had also found numerous examples of staff reassignment and reallocation of budgets from TB to Covid work. In India, Indonesia, the Philippines and South Africa – which account for 44% of all global TB cases – this led to large drops in the number of people diagnosed with the disease between January and June this year. “As a result, the global number of TB deaths could increase by around 0.2–0.4 million in 2020 alone,” the WHO report predicts. It adds that Covid-19 is likely to affect the world’s TB epidemic in two other key ways: GDP per capita and undernutrition. “Modelling has suggested that the number of people developing TB could increase by more than one million per year in the period 2020–2025. The impact on livelihoods resulting from lost income or unemployment could also increase the percentage of people with TB and their households facing catastrophic costs.” This point was backed by Kenyon. “We have to face the fact that we are going to get a lot of deaths caused directly by Covid, but we also have to realise we are going to get a lot of deaths caused indirectly by the disease,” he said.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1783,Ethiopia: reports of heavy casualties in fighting in Tigray,11/8/20,"Heavy casualties have been reported in ongoing clashes between the Ethiopian army and troops loyal to the ruling party of the restive northern province of Tigray. At least six people were killed and 60 people wounded in one location along the Tigray border alone, Doctors Without Borders said on Saturday, and a medical official said nearly 100 government soldiers had been treated for gunshot wounds at a hospital in the northern Amhara region. The Ethiopian prime minister and last year’s Nobel peace prize winner, Abiy Ahmed, sent federal troops and aircraft into Tigray on Wednesday in a major escalation of a long-running feud. The fighting has brought Africa’s second-most populous nation to the brink of what analysts say could be a long and bloody civil war. Abiy and military leaders have touted Ethiopian soldiers’ successes, but a communications blackout in the region has made their accounts difficult to verify. Both sides have access to heavy weapons, armour and considerable stocks of ammunition. Abiy also replaced his army chief on Sunday and appointed the deputy chief, Berhanu Jula, to take charge over the Ethiopian National Defence Force. The move was part of a wider reshuffle that appeared to be aimed at bringing the most vocal supporters of the Tigray operation to the forefront. Ambulances can frequently be seen ferrying wounded combatants to hospital on roads in northern Amhara,, and there have been eyewitness reports of funerals for militia men. “We have had 98 cases. All of them are soldiers from the national army,” said a doctor in the town of Sanja, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said there had been no fatalities at the hospital, but that more serious cases had been transported to larger hospitals in the city of Gondar and elsewhere. Reports of dead and wounded soldiers have mounted in recent days in Amhara, where a humanitarian aid worker said three had died and 35 had been treated on Saturday. Five were reported killed and 105 injured on Friday. Countries in the region fear the fighting could spark all-out civil war and destabilise the Horn of Africa, one of the continent’s most fragile regions. The UN has warned of a major humanitarian crisis if as many as 9 million people flee all-out fighting or Tigray remains largely cut off from the world. In a televised address on Sunday, Abiy accused Tigray’s regional leaders of preparing for war with the federal government since 2018. The group had siphoned development funds to buy weapons and train militias, he said. A senior general told a state-owned newspaper that several locations in Tigray are now under the federal army’s control. “The army has destroyed all the heavy weapons controlled by the infidel group. Now it is marching forward,” he said. The Tigray People’s Liberation Front dominated politics in Ethiopia for nearly three decades before Abiy came to power in 2018 after anti-government protests. It now only controls its home province. Tigray’s leaders have complained of being unfairly targeted in corruption prosecutions, removed from top positions and scapegoated for the country’s woes under Abiy. The long-running feud became more intense after Tigray held its own elections in September in defiance of Abiy’s government, which had decided to postpone national polls because of the coronavirus pandemic. MPs voted on Saturday to suspend Tigray’s leaders and install a caretaker administration in the province. In the capital, Addis Ababa, the mayor announced on Sunday that 10 high-ranking city officials from Tigray had been arrested, accusing them of “betraying the people” and working “to destabilise the peace in our city and engage in cruel and terroristic motives”. But in a Twitter post Sunday, Abiy called on Ethiopians to avoid discriminating against Tigrayans, who make up about 6% of the country’s 110 million people. “I would like to reiterate that no Tigrayan brother or sister should be a victim of identity-based illegal acts, and this responsibility lies on all Ethiopians,” he said. The Ethiopian authorities have not yet formally responded to a request for dialogue from the UN secretary general, António Guterres.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1784,Farage party's relaunch marked with low-key anti-lockdown protest,11/8/20,"Nigel Farage and his allies have relaunched their political party, encouraging people to walk past their local war memorial on Remembrance Sunday in a low-key anti-lockdown protest that marks a fresh attempt to restore their political relevance. The leaders of the Reform UK party – renamed from the Brexit party – hope to occupy a political space until now dominated by a few rebel Conservatives at Westminster, and by conspiracy theorists on the streets and online. The party chairman, Richard Tice, and a few dozen others stood to watch an official wreath-laying ceremony at the Royal Artillery memorial on Hyde Park Corner in central London on Sunday morning, joined by curious joggers and walkers, to the surprise of those officiating who had not expected any more than a handful to turn up. Tice said those attending were engaged in “a demonstration of respect and commemoration in line with the government regulations”, adding that “it was encouraging to see so many people here”. Meanwhile, around 600 protesters gathered in central Manchester against the national lockdown. People started to congregate in Piccadilly Gardens from around 1pm with numbers swelling as the day went on. Social media footage showed a large crowd, many carrying placards, objecting to the government’s decision for a second national shutdown. There appeared to be little social distancing, with few protesters wearing masks as they chanted “rise up” and “freedom”. Greater Manchester police condemned the gathering and said a number of officers had been injured. In a statement on Sunday night the force said four people had been arrested on suspicion of public order offences and and it had issued 24 £200 Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs). It said: “Enquiries are ongoing to also issue an FPN to the organiser.” It added: “Enquiries have established that one group of attendees travelled to Greater Manchester from Cumbria via coach. The driver and the company they work for have both been reported to the relevant industry regulator.” Cllr Pat Karney, Manchester city council’s spokesman, criticised the protesters. “I can completely condemn this disgraceful gathering in Piccadilly Gardens. These people should check out the ambulances going in and out of our hospitals at the moment to see the massive health crisis we are all facing,” he said. “If you disagree with the restrictions, write to your MP but don’t endanger people’s health.” Others present at the London protest included the actor Laurence Fox, who is trying to launch his own political party to “reclaim” British values from politicians, and the London assembly member David Kurten, originally elected under the Ukip banner but now leading his own party. Farage and Tice have been looking for new issues to exploit as the Brexit process draws close to a conclusion, a search with a fresh urgency after the defeat of Donald Trump, who had been their most high-profile overseas supporter. Party insiders said the new direction had been “under consideration for several months”, but the timing appears opportunistic given the second England-wide lockdown was announced only a week ago. Farage had tacked to the right in the summer, highlighting the issue of migrant Channel crossings in tiny, dangerous boats. At that time, he said by autumn he wanted to switch to campaigning on crime and even focus on Gypsy and traveller communities. A spokesperson said the latest redirection had been driven by “the government’s badly handled Covid response”, a belief that “the opposition won’t do any better”, and that the second lockdown was an overreaction. “The lockdown doesn’t seem to gel with lived reality,” said Gawain Towler, a spokesperson for Reform UK. “Yes, we all know people who have been ill or even those who have died. But how many of those have died have been under 60? Meanwhile, we all know people who have been furloughed or are out of work, and that really is a problem for the nation going forward.” Reform UK aims to run candidates in the London, Scottish and Welsh elections next spring. Farage is thought unlikely to stand to be London mayor, but Tice has shown interest in seeking the Conservative nomination in the past. It is unclear how much support there is for an anti-lockdown party in practice. David Lawrence, a researcher with Hope Not Hate, said: “There is potentially a pool for Farage to draw upon, and he has shown with Brexit that he can campaign effectively around an issue.” He pointed to a mushrooming of anti-lockdown groups during spring and early summer, rapidly gaining in popularity even though they were often linked to radical or far-right sentiment or conspiracy topics, anti-vaccination or anti-5G. “Part of the problem is that people are stuck indoors, spending more time online,” he added. Two protest events in London in August and September attracted upwards of 10,000 attendees. Pollsters, however, are less convinced there is significant public sentiment for anti-lockdown politics. A poll by YouGov at the beginning of the month showed 72% of English adults supported the second lockdown, although that was down from 93% at the time of the first lockdown. Deborah Mattinson, from pollster BritainThinks, said: “I think this is attractive to a tiny bunch of people, particularly a niche group of older voters. At the moment we find most people are more fearful about the health than economic risks.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1785,Global coronavirus cases pass 50m with US worst affected country,11/8/20,"The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has passed 50 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, which showed that the US, India and Brazil have the highest figures. A total of 50,052,204 infections had been reported around the world by Sunday evening. The US has the highest number of infections, with 9,879,323, followed by India with 8,507,754 and Brazil, which has reported 5,653,561. Russia has registered the fourth highest number of cases (1,760,420) while France’s total stands at 1,709,773.
The new total came as a Reuters tally calculated that October was the worst month of the coronavirus pandemic so far, with its second wave in the past 30 days accounting for a quarter of all cases. The last month saw the spread of the virus accelerate at a rapid pace: while it took 32 days for cases to rise from 30 million to 40 million, it only took 21 days to add another 10 million. The bleak milestone followed the US reporting more than 100,000 new cases on four consecutive days. The country broke its own record for daily cases nearly every day last week. Europe has also greatly contributed to the global surge in cases. The region has reported around 12 million infections, making it the worst-affected region, overtaking Latin America. It also makes up almost a quarter (24%) of coronavirus deaths. A Reuters analysis has shown the number of new coronavirus cases in Europe is growing by around one million every three days.
The second wave has recently led to governments across Europe tightening restrictions and imposing new lockdowns, with shutdowns ordered in England, France, Germany and Greece. The global death toll stands at more than 1,250,000, according to Johns Hopkins. The US, Brazil and India have recorded the most fatalities, followed by Mexico and the UK.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1786,Go figure: how Britain became a nation of armchair statisticians,11/8/20,"The British distrust of numbers goes back centuries. The Tudor authorities burned maths manuscripts in Oxford for being magical and popish. Dr John Dee, later court astrologer to Elizabeth I, was arrested in 1555 on charges of “calculating”. Florence Nightingale was thought to be a nuisance by generals for counting the soldiers who died in Crimean hospitals, to discover how better to treat them. Now, we are a nation of armchair statisticians, obsessing over seven-day rolling averages and data transparency, and challenging bad stats whenever they appear. The Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) reports that complaints and queries about how government uses official figures rose to four times their previous levels in the first three months of the pandemic. Since April, 90% of OSR cases have been about issues such as the reliability of Covid-19 testing data, and the lack of public access to data that politicians deploy. A case in point is last week’s row about a projection of 4,000 deaths a day in December, if the virus continues unchecked. After Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, presented several scenarios at the press conference announcing the second lockdown, the 4,000 deaths projection was seized on by critics. Leading the charge, Theresa May said in parliament that the figures were “chosen to support the policy”. Naturally, the former prime minister produced her own calculations to support her case. It’s not just the OSR. More or Less, Radio 4’s weekly look behind the stats, has been heard a lot more than less. The show, presented by Tim Harford, was promoted from its comfortable yet obscure Wednesday afternoon berth to a primetime 9am slot, just before Covid-19 hit Britain.
“We had this extraordinary run over the summer, where the BBC kept extending the series – I think it was extended four times,” Harford said. His new book, How to Make the World Add Up, sold out in 36 hours when it was published in September. “So that’s another data point.” At this point, the armchair statisticians of Britain may have noticed something missing. A story quoting statistics showing a rise in interest in statistics has not mentioned how many items of casework the OSR has dealt with. The answer: 110 from April to June 2020, compared with 109 over the previous 12 months. A huge rise – but not large numbers. And More or Less may have moved to a slot when there are usually more listeners, but Radio Joint Audience Research, which publishes data on audience numbers, has not collected any data since March. Does that really add up to a nation obsessed with stats? Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a former president of the Royal Statistical Society and the nation’s go-to man for explaining statistics, settles the matter with an anecdote. “There’s been a massive rise in public interest in statistics,” he said. “I notice that because I have had a continuous stream of correspondence.” For those who carp that the plural of anecdote is not data, Spiegelhalter – chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge University – pointed out that stats are not everything. Quantitative research also requires qualitative research, he said, particularly in medical contexts. “We measure things but we also do interviews that are not turned into numbers. To understand what’s going on, both are absolutely essential – it’s not a choice between the two.” Spiegelhalter, Harford and Mary Gregory, the OSR’s deputy director of regulation, agree that we seem to be treating statistics differently today. In the frenzy of public debate before March, numbers had become ammunition to be fired at the opposing side, on Brexit, immigration, trade, crime and every other matter of contention. Now, figures about testing, deaths, cases and hospital beds are essential for having any grasp of what’s going on. “Everybody wants to know what the latest figures are in a way that I don’t think any other statistics published by government have quite had that impact on people,” Gregory said. “I’ve never been in a job where so many people in my personal life are interested in what I do in my work life.”
Interest in the OSR soared in June when Sir David Norgrove, the head of the UK Statistics Authority, wrote to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, accusing ministers of misleading the public over testing data. At the time, Hancock and health officials were aiming for a target of 200,000 tests a day but gave only numbers of tests supplied, rather than how many had actually been carried out – a far more useful figure for anyone trying to understand the state of the testing regime. Since Norgrove’s broadside, the OSR has found it much easier to persuade officials and politicians to publish more data – there might be a link, Gregory said. The government’s Covid-19 dashboard has been expanded. Public Health England has published more local authority-level data. The housing ministry has published information on rough sleepers. And as a result of criticism by the OSR of Conservative and Labour claims during last year’s general election, the Department for Education now publishes official statistics on school funding. “Our experience is quite positive when we approach somebody because there’s been a potential misuse of statistics,” Gregory said. “We almost always get the reaction that they want to make sure they correct it.” Politicians and journalists do not generally lie but they are not off the hook, according to Will Moy, the chief executive of the independent fact-checking charity Full Fact, which has seen about 17 million visitors to its website this year – roughly twice as many as last year. “We’re not happy, and neither is the public,” he said. “People generally do not trust politicians or journalists to tell the truth, and that’s a tragedy. A lot of the time when we fact-check things, we find that what people have said is accurate, or they have made a reasonable mistake. The idea that everybody is lying to us all the time is wrong. But you don’t have to be lying all the time to be untrustworthy.” Harford’s first piece of advice to amateur statisticians is to notice their own emotional reaction before disputing claims: “It’s very easy to fool yourself into rejecting things that you shouldn’t.” Perception v reality PERCEPTION Many people believe that violence is rising, yet fewer than two in 100 adults were victims of violent crime in 2016/7, compared with the peak of nearly five in 100 in 1995.

1788,How long Covid forced me to confront my past and my identity,11/8/20,"For six years now, I have been writing down three good things that have happened in my day, every day. It doesn’t matter how big or small they are. It could be having pastries in bed. Spotting a fox in the garden. Successfully descaling a kettle. I do not call this my gratitude journal, because I am not a motivational wellness blogger. But I have found it vital, in order to rewire my brain to focus on the things that have gone right. Left unattended, my thoughts have a tendency to slip into a downward spiral, to somewhere much darker. I grew up in Italy, where there is a saying: “Non c’è due senza tre”, which roughly means “Good (or bad) things come in threes”. For most of my adult life, there have been three main issues that have preoccupied my thoughts when I’m lying in bed at night. I have guarded them preciously: I barely mention them, even to my closest friends. But, sometimes, repressing thoughts takes more effort than confronting them. The first of the three has always been there. I was born with a malformation in my left forearm: it is several inches shorter than the right and bends at the elbow; my left hand has four fingers. I had several rounds of corrective surgery as a child, travelling around to meet doctors and specialists (one told my mother: “Of course, she’ll never be Cindy Crawford,” as I sat next to her and burst into tears). For six months, aged 13, I wore an Ilizarov frame: the bones in my arm were broken and attached to metal screws, which were gradually lengthened to stimulate a couple of inches of growth. Somewhat comically, I wore a cardigan over it, pretending people wouldn’t notice me walking around with a sharp metal frame attached to my body. Unsurprisingly, added to the usual pressures placed on young women to look a certain way, my arm did not help my self-esteem growing up. It certainly made dating… interesting, though, in retrospect, it did at least keep away anyone closed-minded enough to be wary of difference. I was never bullied, exactly, but the odd comment and glance has stuck in my mind with a peculiar persistence. The cashier who, out of the blue, confronted me with a barrage of questions, including how I ate. The inquisitive looks from children who have not yet learned how to discreetly ignore. The friend of a friend who caught a glimpse of it and cried out: “What is that?” before quickly realising her mistake. Perhaps you would not notice it immediately if you met me. I prefer long sleeves, and am keenly aware, especially around new people, of ways of concealing it. Maybe once a year, thinking about it will overwhelm me to the point of tears; normally it is simply whirring in the back of my mind, a constant murmur of background noise. Day to day, it’s not so much the things I can’t physically do that bother me – although not being able to play a musical instrument is the thing I most regret – as the everyday activities I avoid because I know they will cause me distress: group exercise classes, swimming, manicures. People are usually too polite to bring it up in conversation – which works perfectly for me, so please don’t start now (if I want to discuss it, I’ll broach the subject myself, though I probably won’t). The second thing that keeps me up at night was revealed when I was 15. My periods hadn’t started, so I visited a gynaecologist to check whether everything was in order. For the months leading up to the visit I remember feeling low-level anxiety about it: what if something else was wrong with me? But what were the odds – I had already had such bad luck. It turned out everything was not in order: I was diagnosed with another rare syndrome, Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH), meaning I had been born with an underdeveloped uterus, and would never be able to have children.
The following month passed in a blur. I cried on the sofa; I went to school; I went to the cinema, feeling numb. I more or less stopped eating for a year. I cut my hair short, dyed it black and made some angsty art. I listened to a lot of PJ Harvey and read existentialist Russian novels whose intense emotions matched my own. Seeing as the traditional womanly accomplishments of beauty and fertility were now out of reach, I threw myself into studying, finishing school with the highest results in my year. I discovered alcohol. At 15, I had never thought about children: I had imagined any broodiness would start after my periods, which never came. Now, aged 32, I need to confront the realities of what the diagnosis will mean for me in the long term. Whatever my partner and I decide to do will come with its own set of complications. If we don’t have children, which considering the state of the world feels like an increasingly attractive option, there will be the inevitable questions and sad looks. If we were to try surrogacy – via an ethical, safe and non-exploitative route – people would judge us for using the woman as a vessel. Adoption can be extremely complicated. At the moment, all options are on the table. The third issue was a one-off event: aged 18, I was sexually assaulted at university after having my drink spiked. I will be brief about this, mainly to spare my parents the pain (the only thing they need to know is that it was not their fault and it wasn’t mine; the blame lies entirely with the man involved). Survivors do not owe you their story. I repressed thinking about the assault, sometimes more successfully and sometimes less so, for years, until I finally admitted to myself what had happened. Memory is an incredible thing. Michaela Coel’s TV drama I May Destroy You is remarkably accurate on the subject. This completed the trio: I’m not superstitious, but there was a circularity to it. Surely the worst was behind me. The following decade or so passed in relative calm. I found I could just about cope with the low hum of depression through exercise, wine, denial and sheer stubbornness; I displaced my anxiety on to smaller, more manageable things. As the political situation took a turn for the worse four years ago, coping became more difficult. While my personal life had never been better – engaged, in a job I love, with a strong circle of friends – everything outside that felt frantic, unmoored. Escapist entertainment became more valuable than the dark, challenging culture I had grown up consuming. I went on marches, I went door-knocking, I signed petitions. But mainly I tried to cocoon myself, safe in my bubble. And then, a fourth thing arrived. On 20 March, my partner started to feel ill with Covid-19. We tried to isolate from each other in our one-bedroom flat, but it was no use: three days later, my skin turned cold and I started to shiver, feeling something new and alien move around my body. The following few weeks were frightening, though not particularly painful; we were young and healthy, we thought, we’d shake it off in no time. A number of our friends were ill too: it seemed as if everyone was going through the same thing. Our friends got better. We got worse. The week of my partner’s birthday in April, he lay in bed with shooting pains in his chest and left arm, as I sat in the next room silently reading news stories about 30-year-olds in the US dying from Covid-related strokes. When we were meant to be getting married in Italy in June, we took the week off work but were barely able to leave the house. In August, a year after we climbed the Inca Trail in Peru to Machu Picchu, a walk around the local park brought on a week of excruciating chest pain. Despite having exercised every precaution (masks, gloves, hand sanitiser, staying home), we went from the fittest we had ever been to essentially bed-bound. We don’t know for sure, but the fact we were both affected in the same way suggests that the issue may have been down to a high viral load, which is why the virus can wreak such havoc on young bodies. For my partner, who has never had a medical issue in his life, the challenge was finding himself suddenly ill. For me, the thought of having yet another thing wrong with my body felt unfair to the point of being unbearable. Of course, that’s a ridiculous thing to think: having a prior medical condition does not grant you immunity from future illness, and there is no one keeping score of the way injustice is meted out. But something about the disease feels personal. It has attacked the parts of my body that hadn’t been affected by the other conditions: my heart, my lungs, my muscles. My nervous system – the thing my career and livelihood depend on – feels damaged, somehow: there are headaches, brain fog, forgotten words. The list of things I can’t do has got significantly longer. Oddly, it is exercise I miss the most. Used to being the last picked in PE, I have never liked team sports or gyms, but I’ve always been active. For the first three months of this year I was exercising five times a week or more: yoga, running, cycling, YouTube fitness videos. Now, anything more arduous than a short walk brings on flare-ups of debilitating pain. The one thing shown to improve physical and mental health is, for now at least, out of reach.
The terrifying thing about the virus, and its aftermath of chronic pain and post-viral fatigue, is that it is unknown and incurable. You can hear the hesitation in your doctor’s voice when you ask how long it’s likely to affect your body; you both know there is no answer. We have tried everything: paracetamol, rest, kale smoothies, breathing exercises, postural drainage, decongestants, turmeric, zinc, vitamins (B12, C, D, K), probiotics, weighted blankets, meditation apps, CBD oil, restorative yoga aimed at people recovering from lung cancer. Nearly eight months on, the symptoms are slowly improving; doctors tentatively suggest it is likely we will fully recover. But one of the most difficult things to deal with has been the unpredictable and shifting nature of the symptoms, the fact that recovery is non-linear. One day it might feel like it has completely vanished. Then, one morning, you wake up with the same awful feeling in your lungs, as if they are being constricted and have collapsed in on themselves. Each recurrence feels worse than the last: it should have gone by now, you think; what if I never get better? What do you do when your worst fear – or a fear you didn’t even know you had – comes true? Two months into the illness, I started speaking to a therapist, who is helping me find a way back to being kind to myself. For the first time in my life, I went on antidepressants: they didn’t solve everything, but they did mean I stopped crying several times a day, until I had to stop taking them because they were giving me heart palpitations. I played The Sims 4 and watched episode after episode of the reality show Selling Sunset (then felt annoyed at myself for wasting time). I tried to work on my dystopian sci-fi novel (but then again who hasn’t). I bought a lot of lipsticks.
Make yourself vulnerable and people will love you for it, goes the mantra, from Oprah to RuPaul. But what if you bare your deepest secrets and it makes people recoil? What if it’s too much, too depressing, and people look away? In an age where relatability is prized above all else, what do you do when your issues are so rare and so specific? This is normally the point in the piece in which the subject talks about how the adversity they overcame was the best thing that ever happened to them. How it changed their worldview and made them the person they are today, that they wouldn’t change it for the world, that their disability is their superpower. For some people this is the case, but it isn’t particularly helpful to expect that everyone will have this same reaction. I waited and waited for the eureka moment when I would accept all the things that had happened to me, the realisation that they were what made me special. But what if that moment never came? My experiences have shaped my personality, in some ways for the better, and in some ways for the worse. I would change it all in an instant if I could. What I can say is that I am proud of the things I have got through, any one of which could have been enough to derail the course of someone’s life. At the same time, I want to reassure others with similar conditions or experiences that you don’t need to berate yourself for feeling upset, which can in turn feel like an additional burden. If something causes you to suffer, those thoughts are valid too. I never thought I’d write about any of this, let alone share it with anyone. I have felt no desire to expose my darkest secrets to internet trolls, or for people to skim-read over their morning coffee; I have no interest in being seen as a tragic figure, a victim. I have long been wary of personal essays, and the expectation that young writers (especially women) mine their trauma for clicks. With everything that’s going on in the world, listing the ways the universe has wronged me felt like a petty endeavour; as a cis, white, middle-class woman, I felt like my voice was not what was needed at the moment. With regard to my disability, I wanted to lead by example: not being pigeonholed, showing that you did not need to write about the things that made you different but about anything you liked – music, film, TV, art, comedy, cats. But, at the same time, I have known for a long time that I needed to write this. As has become increasingly evident, representation matters, and who you are is important. Until now, I have been careful to ensure that there were no indications of my medical conditions online. Partly, this was self-preservation. Partly, it was down to vanity: the fantasy internet version of me was whole, perfect. Representation, however, only works if the difference is visible. Growing up, I never saw anyone like me in the media; disability is still one of the least represented groups across journalism, film and TV. I can’t speak on behalf of anyone else, especially considering how widely experiences vary across disabilities. But if reading this helps another confused, anxious little girl, it will have been worth it. Popular culture has a lot to answer for. It’s not just the Bond villains with the inevitable facial scars and hooks for hands. It’s Werner Herzog, David Lynch, Ari Aster, Jonathan Glazer – directors I love – who turn to actors with disabilities to create a sense of the uncanny. I recently had to switch off a seemingly inoffensive mid-2010s romcom (which has been described as a “light, delightful movie” with a “hip indie twist”) after its fourth joke at the expense of disabled people in under an hour. As a child, I loved Disney’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame: I wanted to be Esmeralda, but I knew deep down that some people would always see me as Quasimodo (there is no archetype in which monster and beauty are combined; it is one or the other). There is still a long way to go, but some progress has been made. Tyrion Lannister in Game of Thrones was one of the first characters I felt I could identify with: angry, flawed, lusty, likes a drink; turned to books to find self-worth. And in Naked Attraction of all places, I was pleased to see that a gorgeous man with a prosthetic leg and a tattoo of an elephant around his penis was one of the first to be picked for a date. Generally, we need to see all kinds of bodies in all kinds of programmes, not just relegating certain groups to separate shows that are by their very nature often patronising and infantilising. I have been very fortunate in many ways, less so in others. My life is not one of misery: even in lockdown, I have filled my days with friends, love and moments of happiness. I don’t want to be forever associated with the things that cause me pain. My worst nightmare would be having my life experience reduced to a headline such as “My disability does not define me”. After all, I never chose any of this, so why should it shape the way people think about me? In a way, having had all these four things happen to me means I am not defined by any one of them. Just picking one as my distinguishing characteristic would feel arbitrary, reductive: they have all had an important impact on me in different ways.
I don’t want to be seen as impressive despite the setbacks I’ve experienced, I want to be seen as impressive, full stop. I don’t want to be described as “brave” or “inspirational” simply for existing; it’s not as if I have much choice. Just like everybody else, I would like to be thought of as smart, and attractive, and witty, with impeccable taste in music. All over the world, political movements are being formed around the fear of difference. People who fall under protected characteristics – race, creed, sexuality, disability – are under a greater threat than ever. The question of not wanting to be judged for something out of your control is one that is intimate and personal to each of us, so it is vital that we stand together and support one another. Identity politics is too vast a topic to cover here, but I would just like to remind anyone who finds the concept problematic that none of us choose who we are. No one is asking for preferential treatment, just a recognition that certain things are more difficult for some people than others. I have spent a long time thinking about identity: a funny, slippery thing. Mine has always been in flux: I was born in Italy to an English father and an Italian mother, and lived in Vienna for most of my teenage years. In Italy, I was seen as English, in Austria I was seen as Italian; over here my accent confuses people (it has been described as “home counties with the odd continental twang”). Given my diagnosis at 15, much of the discourse around trans rights and what constitutes a “real woman” is personally painful. Excluding certain individuals because of anatomical difference feels regressive, cruel, fearful of the other. Growing up, I could not join in with my friends’ conversations about periods, birth control, the morning-after pill – something that caused me a great deal of shame, suffering and confusion. But is that all being a woman is? If trans women are not women, according to these rules, I’m not either; though if I’m not a woman, what exactly am I? One thing I have firmly believed for a long time is that, in the words of an album title by one of my favourite bands, Dirty Three: Whatever You Love, You Are. So this is what I love. The beach in Italy. Falling asleep cuddled up to my cats. Courgette flowers fried in tempura batter, cooked by my mum. A pint of Neck Oil at my favourite pub. Kanye West and Taylor Swift. Afrobeat-inflected jazz. Puns (the more puerile the better). Doing karaoke (badly). Singing along to Hamilton (whitely). Audrey Horne’s cherry trick in Twin Peaks. Films about men slowly losing their minds in jungles. Videos of animals on trampolines. I don’t think there will ever come a point when I will be fully at peace with everything that has happened to me; at least, it won’t be any time soon. But, if nothing else, the process of writing this has felt beneficial: while I can’t change reality, I can reshape the narrative. I started watching The Sopranos in lockdown (finally – I know), and if we’ve learned anything about mental health – a key theme of the show – over these past decades, it’s that suffering in silence is neither healthy nor helpful. There’s another saying, “Mal comune, mezzo gaudio” (“A trouble shared is a trouble halved”). No one is going to have gone through the exact same experiences I have. But whatever challenges you face, I have found that there is value in reading about how others handle the obstacles life has put in their way; no one, after all, gets through life unscathed. At a moment when the world is filled with so much suffering, the best we can hope for is to scramble to find some kind of meaning in it. Who knows: perhaps one day I’ll look back on this time and conclude that Covid-19 marked an important turning point in my life. For now, though, I just need to get through it, three-good-things-a-day at a time. Kathryn Bromwich is a commissioning editor on the Guardian",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1789,How will we know when England can come out of lockdown?,11/8/20,"The next couple of weeks will be crucial in determining what kind of Christmas we have this year: a lonely, joyless affair in front of our TVs or, at best, a modest celebration, sharing the odd Christmas cracker with one or two close relatives. The arithmetic that will determine the outcome is straightforward, say scientists. If we are to have any prospect of getting out of national lockdown in four weeks, then case numbers of Covid-19 will have to fall – significantly. And it will not be obvious that we are succeeding in reaching that goal until we are in the third or fourth week of our 28-day seclusion. However, if numbers do go down fairly sharply by 2 December, and if the R value drops well below 1, then we can hope for some reprieve from restriction – albeit one still limited by the tier system. London could contemplate opening up to tier 2 and possibly get some access to pubs and restaurants, for example. “We’re not talking about coming out of lockdown and going straight into a great big Christmas party,” said virologist Professor Nicola Stonehouse, of Leeds University. “We’re talking about going back into the tier system. I live in Leeds, and I would love to think that we’ll be in tier 2 coming out of this. We will have to wait and see, however.” Achieving such goals will require fairly dramatic infection reductions and people accepting continued limitations on their personal freedom. That is the contract we have made with the government. But it is a two-way deal, scientists insist. For their part, ministers must grapple effectively with the pandemic and fulfil their side of the unstated deal they have made with the public – for the actions they take over the coming month will be every bit as important as those taken by their citizens.
For a start, the government must use the next four weeks to make its test-and-trace system work properly. It is simply inadequate at present. Getting it to work would give the nation a chance of taking some control of the pandemic when lockdown stops. But what scientists also stress is that testing and tracing are not enough. Ensuring people who test positive can isolate is the really crucial business, they insist. And that aspect of the system has simply not been addressed. “Sending infected individuals back to isolate at homes they might share with several generations of families, including elderly relatives is not the way to do this,” said Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University. “We need to think about putting infected people in hostels or similar accommodation. They will also need financial support.” It was crucial, he added, that the government acted decisively on this issue. “In exchange for us giving up our freedoms, the government actually has to do something to make sure we don’t have to do this again.” And that prospect was a real worry, he added. Modelling carried out at Edinburgh University last March suggested one particularly likely scenario. It forecast that the country would have to go through a three-month lockdown, which would be followed by a drop in case numbers in summer, before a second wave of the disease arrived in the autumn. “The worrying thing about that scenario is that it also forecast that there would be a third wave early next year,” said Woolhouse. “Now I am not predicting a third wave, but I most certainly cannot rule it out. And if there is a third wave in another few months followed by another lockdown, I would be very concerned about people’s compliance with it on a third occasion. In essence, this is the government’s last chance to get its act together.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1790,Inseparable for 44 years – the couple banned from touching because of Covid,11/8/20,"They met on a blind date and married nine months later. For the next 44 years, Chris and Trish Walker were inseparable. Until the pandemic. For the past eight months, Trish has not been allowed to touch her husband and has only been able to speak to him for just over an hour, even though he has already had – and recovered from – Covid-19. The restrictions were imposed by the 74-year-old’s care home in London, where he was placed after a spell in hospital. It was supposed to be a temporary measure but it feels permanent to his wife. “The carpet has been pulled out from underneath you and you’re still falling, because everything that was part of our life is still there at home. Except he isn’t,” she said. “I can’t let myself unravel,” she added. “It’s as if you’re a widow, but you’re not. Divorced, but you’re not. You’re between worlds. You become nothing. You’re not his wife any more in any meaningful sense – but you are, and you want to be.” Trish had just begun teaching French in Belfast in 1975 when she met Chris, who was a journalist working in Northern Ireland. “We met on a blind date at the Europa hotel,” she said. “He was great fun, very droll. Lots of anecdotes, interesting stories.”
They married in a small ceremony in Oxford and celebrated at the Cherwell Boathouse. When Chris was posted to Jerusalem, Moscow, then Beirut to serve as a foreign correspondent for newspapers and broadcasters, Trish went with him, working as a French teacher in international schools. In May 2017, Chris was admitted to the Maudsley Hospital when he started to lose cognitive function and mobility. Doctors spent two years trying to find a diagnosis. Shortly before the pandemic hit, it had been decided Chris should return home. During his hospital stay, Trish was a regular visitor, until her last visit on 18 March. “I would sit with him and read him funny articles from the Spectator,” she said. “We would talk.” He fell ill on 23 March and tested positive for Covid-19, but only suffered a high temperature for a few days. They have tried to talk over the phone, but rigidity in Chris’s fingers means it is almost impossible for him to hold a handset. “Gradually, you heard on the news that care homes were doing their best to facilitate visitors but this one wouldn’t,” Trish said. “They kept saying no. I phoned the Care Quality Commission [which regulates care homes] and they said no, it’s Public Health England, they make the rules.” She was eventually allowed three short visits in the summer but since September the home has been shut to visitors, despite guidance from health secretary Matt Hancock allowing care homes to open. “It is a prison sentence and there seems to be no redress,” Trish said.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1791,Johnson risks rift with Biden by pressing ahead with Brexit bill,11/8/20,"Boris Johnson has risked opening a rift with the US president-elect, Joe Biden, by insisting the internal markets bill that reneges on part of the EU withdrawal agreement would go ahead as planned. The prime minister said the legislation would go through parliament and added that the planned changes, which would hand unilateral power to ministers to change or disapply export rules for goods traveling from Britain to Northern Ireland, would protect the Good Friday peace deal. “The whole point of that bill and indeed the finance bill is to protect and uphold the Good Friday agreement and the peace process in Northern Ireland. And again, that’s one of the things that we’re united on with our friends in the White House,” he said. Biden, who has Irish roots, has expressed negative views on the UK’s plans to override parts of the agreement if no deal is reached with the bloc. During the campaign, Biden said that “any trade deal between the US and UK must be contingent upon respect for the agreement and preventing the return of a hard border”. Johnson, who has not yet spoken to Biden, said there was “far more that unites the government of this country and government in Washington any time, any stage, than divides us” – despite a series of sceptical comments made by Biden and his allies about the prime minister. The House of Lords is expected to vote this week to remove parts of the internal markets bill that would break international law by removing some of the commitments in the agreement, something Labour has challenged the government to concede. Biden has previously called Johnson the “physical and emotional clone of Donald Trump” and allies of the new Democratic administration have been scathing about the UK prime minister. Tommy Vietor, the former national security spokesman for Barack Obama, commenting on the prime minister’s congratulatory message to Biden, tweeted that Johnson was a “shapeshifting creep” and added: “We will never forget your racist comments about Obama and slavish devotion to Trump.” Johnson said there was much the pair could work on, including climate change. Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, exited the Paris climate agreement, which Biden has said he will renew. “I think now with President Biden in the White House in Washington, we have the real prospect of American global leadership in tackling climate change,” he said. “I see that President Biden shares a slogan, ‘Build Back Better’ – we claim no proprietary rights over that slogan. But when you when you come to build back better, one of the ways to do it is to do it through a green industrial revolution.” Johnson played down any prospect of immediate trade negotiations with the US under Biden. “I’m a keen student of the United States’ trade policy and they’re tough negotiations,” he said. “And I’ve never believed that this was going to be something that was going to be a complete pushover under any US administration. I think there’s a good chance we’ll do something.” Earlier, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he would “listen very carefully” to the concerns of US Democrats but said the risk to the Good Friday agreement came from the EU.
Raab said he was sure diplomats would be able to smooth things over in Washington. “I’m confident we will navigate all of those issues sensitively and correctly,” he told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show. “We listen very carefully to the concerns of our American friends. Particularly on the Hill in the Irish lobby they feel very invested in the Good Friday agreement, we understand that. But it is not the UK that is putting it at risk, it is the EU.” Raab was also pressed on whether he believed there had been irregularities in the US voting system, after he had tweeted “some of the processes are still playing out” in his congratulatory message to Biden. “I’m not getting dragged in either to the election campaign or the immediate aftermath,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge. “We want to avoid getting sucked into the US domestic politics but it is very clear now in our view that there is a definitive result. “There may be some contest claims of irregularities but we’ve always said we have got full faith in the checks and balances of the American system to reach a clear result, and they’ve done that now.” Asked repeatedly if all votes should be counted in an election, Raab said “in principle, yes, of course” but said he did not want to be drawn into the controversies in the US. “We really don’t want to get drawn into the cut and thrust, the controversies, the claims, the counter-claims, either in the election or in the immediate aftermath, and that is we respect Americans’ rights to choose for themselves and we respect the checks and balances in the American system which will produce, as they have, a clear result.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1792,"Jonathan Sacks, former chief rabbi, is buried in modest ceremony",11/8/20,"Jonathan Sacks, the former chief rabbi, was buried in a small ceremony on Sunday, less than 24 hours after his death from cancer was announced, in keeping with Jewish custom. The service was conducted in line with government Covid guidelines, meaning a maximum of 30 people present. The funeral of a such a high-profile figure in the Jewish community would have attracted hundreds or thousands of mourners in non-pandemic times. Sacks, who was 72, was the Orthodox chief rabbi for 22 years until 2013, and was made a life peer in 2009. His regular Thought for the Day broadcasts on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and newspaper articles ensured his views on values and society reached far beyond the Jewish community. He had announced three weeks ago that he was being treated for unspecified cancer, after twice being successfully treated for the disease earlier in his life. The Prince of Wales was among those to pay tribute, saying Sacks’ “wisdom, scholarship and humanity were without equal”. Charles said in a statement: “His immense learning spanned the sacred and the secular, and his prophetic voice spoke to our greatest challenges with unfailing insight and boundless compassion. His wise counsel was sought and appreciated by those of all faiths and none, and he will be missed more than words can say.” Boris Johnson, Keir Starmer and Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, issued tributes after the announcement of Sacks’ death at the weekend. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Catholic archbishop of Westminster, expressed sorrow to “the worldwide Jewish community on the loss of this great figure … I have lost a friend, the Jewish community a great leader, humanity an eloquent spokesman.” The Council of Christians and Jews described Sacks as a “towering religious leader and intellectual”. It said: “His books, other writings, lectures and media appearances were followed and admired not only by the Jewish community but millions of Christians, and people of all faiths and none … His influence will endure for years to come through the many he inspired, influenced and touched with his warmth and wisdom.” Ronald Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, said the Jewish world was profoundly saddened. Sacks was a “riveting orator and brilliant author who brought the timeless teachings of Jewish scripture to both Jews and non-Jews alike, fusing Jewish tradition with modern thought … He was also a pillar of integrity.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1793,Keir Starmer urges Labour to learn from Joe Biden's 'broad coalition',11/8/20,"The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has urged his party to learn from Joe Biden’s “broad coalition” which won back voters who turned away from the Democrats four years ago, pointing to the president-elect’s emphasis on “family, community and security”. Starmer, an enthusiastic supporter of Biden’s bid who shares a WhatsApp group with his staff called “Let’s Go Joe”, said the victory of the former vice-president and his running mate Kamala Harris would “fill the void in global leadership” and was a vote “for a better, more optimistic future”. Writing in the Guardian, Starmer suggested he intended his party to emulate the Democratic strategy of winning back US “blue wall” states like Michigan and Pennsylvania lost to Donald Trump in 2016, just as Labour lost its “red wall” of northern seats in 2019. “This election had stark lessons for those of us who want to see progressive values triumph over the forces of division and despair,” Starmer wrote. “The Democrats’ path to victory this week was paved by a broad coalition, including many of the states and communities that four years ago turned away from them.” Starmer said it “takes time” to win back trust of voters who abandoned their traditional parties, and suggested it involved talking about issues for which his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn had been criticised such as security. “It takes political leaders who listen, learn and renew. President Biden spoke to the soul of the nation, with a focus on who people are and what they value: family, community and security,” he wrote. “One election victory does not mean that work is now finished for the Democrats; for us in the Labour party, it is only just beginning.” His appeal for his party to emulate the Democrats’ appeal to a broad base comes as his leadership faces its biggest test yet to party unity, with the suspension of former leader Corbyn over his response to the equalities watchdog’s report into antisemitism in the party sparking an outraged response from the left. Starmer said Biden’s election was time to “reset that partnership” with the US, urging the government to seize the opportunity by abandoning its much-criticised move to renege on parts of the EU withdrawal bill, set to be debated in the House of Lords this week. “We will soon have a president in the Oval Office who has been a passionate advocate for the preservation of the Good Friday agreement,” Starmer wrote. “He, like governments across the world, will take a dim view if our prime minister ploughs ahead with proposals to undermine that agreement. If the government is serious about a reset in its relationship with the United States, then it should take an early first step and drop these proposals.” Boris Johnson has said he intends to press ahead with the bill’s controversial clauses, despite facing near certain defeat when the House of Lords votes on measures on Monday. The internal market bill gives ministers the power to unilaterally rewrite elements of the withdrawal agreement with the EU. Starmer said a new US leadership could also lead to a more joined-up approach in global coronavirus vaccine research, as well as responding to security threats and the climate crisis. “Equally, when our allies are wrong, Britain should be prepared to speak out and say so. We are at our best when the world knows we have the courage of our convictions and a clear moral purpose,” he wrote. “In recent years, this has been absent. For the United States of America and for Britain, this is the time to return to the world stage. This is the time for us to lead.” Starmer has not met Biden personally, but the shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, said Labour was on good terms with high-profile Democrats. “Of course we are comparing notes, talking to one another, how do we defeat those with this sort of populist tradition, how do you move forward against the backdrop of culture wars?” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show. “I think that the Labour party in this country wants to be a party for the whole nation and not just one tribe. That’s what we’ve seen in the United States which Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and of course we will seek to replicate that.” He said Labour and the Democrats were “sister parties in a sense”, and added: “I’ve got longstanding relationships with Democrats … my friendship with the former president Barack Obama is well documented.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1794,NHS England suspends one-to-one nursing for critically ill Covid patients,11/8/20,"Nurses will be allowed to look after two critically ill Covid-19 patients at the same time after NHS bosses relaxed the rule requiring one-to-one treatment in intensive care as hospitals come under intense strain. NHS England has decided to temporarily suspend the 1:1 rule as the number of people who are in hospital very sick with Covid has soared to 11,514, of whom 986 are on a ventilator. The move comes amid concern that intensive care units, which went into the pandemic already short of nurses, are being hit by staff being off sick or isolating as a result of Covid. It follows a warning last week by Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, that the Covid resurgence could overwhelm the NHS. Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care, which represents doctors in ICUs, welcomed the shift to a more “flexible” nurse/patient staffing ratio in critical care. But she said it must be used only for as long as the second wave is putting units under serious pressure. “Covid has placed the NHS, and critical care in particular, in an unenviable position and we must admit everyone for whom the benefits of critical care outweigh the burdens. This means relaxing the normal staffing ratios to meet this demand in such a way that delivers safe care, but also takes account of the impact this may have on staff health and wellbeing. “The 1:2 ratio is a maximum ratio, to be used only to support Covid activity, [and] not for planned care, and is not sustainable in the long term. This protects staff and patients”, she said. NHS England has agreed the relaxation with the British Association of Critical Care Nurses, which represents specialist nurses who work in high-dependency units and ICUs. They are due to confirm the arrangement in a formal announcement soon.
Whitty used an interview last week with the British Medical Journal to warn that the combination of Covid and usual cold season surge in illnesses will bring “an extremely difficult winter for the NHS – one that I suspect, unfortunately, will be unlike any we’ve seen in recent memory”. One of the ways Covid can lead to deaths is through “an over-running of the emergency services such that all emergency care stops. We fortunately avoided that in the first wave, but it’s not a given if we don’t take strong action.” The NHS-wide lack of critical care nurses was a key factor in the 1:2 decision, Pittard added. “The [revised] guidance is needed because we do not have enough critical care staff to support the increase in beds required to care for all the patients with Covid and those with other conditions needing admission. “There is [also ongoing Covid-related] sickness that makes the current situation worse, but the main issue is the longstanding failure to expand the workforce, and that is doctors, nurses and allied health professionals,” she added. The new 1:2 ratio is much better than NHS England’s decision in the spring to allow critical care nurses to look after as many as six Covid patients if patient numbers required that. However, it is thought that despite that change then, no nurse cared for more than four patients in the first peak. Susan Masters, the Royal College of Nursing’s director of nursing, policy and public affairs, said: “Reducing the ratio of nurses to patients must be a temporary measure and only when it is absolutely necessary. We must ensure patient safety at the same time as protecting the wellbeing of the nurses who care for them. “This change means increasing the workload of intensive care nurses and there must be consideration of the physical and emotional toll this will take.” NHS England declined to comment directly on the change in guidance. A spokesperson said only that “the NHS has 13,000 more full-time equivalent nurses than we did last year and record numbers have signed up to start nursing degrees this autumn”. “However, with Covid-19 infections rising again both here and across Europe, the medical royal colleges and professional associations have made it clear that just as they did during the first Covid wave, doctors, nurses and other health professionals will of course treat everyone who needs critical care.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1795,PM who won Nobel peace prize takes Ethiopia to brink of civil war,11/8/20,"The beginning of the week saw Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister of Ethiopia, in one role: a forward-looking statesman, with a vision of peace and prosperity, and a tailored suit. The 44-year-old leader was at Addis Ababa’s recently modernised airport to welcome General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, effective leader of neighbouring Sudan for a two-day visit including trade discussions and tours of the Ethiopian capital’s skyscrapers, a seedling nursery and an industrial park.
The second half of the week saw Abiy in a different mode: on national television in a dark bomber jacket to make the startling announcement he had ordered troops to respond to an alleged deadly attack on a government military base by local forces in the country’s Tigray province. A day later, senior Ethiopian generals spoke of being “at war” amid reports of artillery duels, while officials in Tigray claimed that jets had bombed parts of its capital. The contrast between “besuited Abiy” and “bomber jacket Abiy” was sharp, as was that between Abiy’s early days in power back in 2018 – when observers compared the young reforming leader to Nelson Mandela, Justin Trudeau, Barack Obama and Mikhail Gorbachev – and the darker more troubled time now. For some, the real Abiy is only now being seen. “You don’t come up through the ranks of military intelligence and the ruling coalition in Ethiopia and be Mr Nice Guy. It just doesn’t happen,” said Martin Plaut, a regional expert at London University. “The narrative of Abiy the reformer is overrated,” said Tsedale Lemma, editor in chief of the independent Addis Standard news magazine in the Ethiopian capital. “I am afraid full-fledged authoritarianism is where he is going next.” Born in western Ethiopia, Abiy joined the resistance against the brutal regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam as a teenager before enlisting in the armed forces. In 1998 he was a radio operator attached to an Ethiopian unit fighting Eritrean forces. When he briefly left his foxhole to find better antenna reception, his entire unit was wiped out in an artillery attack. Abiy went on to rise through the ranks of military intelligence, eventually swapping the army for academe, earning a doctorate in peace and security studies. After a stint running Ethiopia’s cyberintelligence service, he entered politics and was rapidly promoted within the coalition that had ruled the country since Mengistu was deposed in 1991. Abiy’s surprise appointment as prime minister in 2018 came after months of anti-government protests. Immediately, his informal style, charisma and energy impressed after decades of opaque and repressive rule. In quick succession, Abiy reshuffled his cabinet, fired a series of controversial and hitherto untouchable civil servants, reached out to hostile neighbours and rivals, lifted media bans, freed thousands of political prisoners, ordered the partial privatisation of massive state-owned companies and ended a state of emergency.
He has also tried to appeal to women, making an unprecedented mention of his wife and mother in his acceptance speech. Surprised visitors spoke of the shelves of books on religion, philosophy and science that filled Abiy’s office – and its open door. One personal acquaintance described the new prime minister as “always looking ahead for the future … with a bit of headstrong attitude towards people who don’t deliver”. There were also hopes of an end, or at least a pause, to the ethnic strife rending the second most populous country on the continent. It was widely hoped Abiy’s mixed Christian and Muslim background, and fluency in three of the country’s main languages would allow him to bridge communal and sectarian divides. He was also the first leader from Ethiopia’s largest ethnic community, the Oromo, who have complained for decades of economic, cultural and political marginalisation, and were behind much of the growing unrest that led to Abiy’s appointment. No one doubted the challenge. Ethiopia faced a shortage of foreign currency, growing inequality, a lack of jobs for a huge number of graduates – at least 70% of the population is under 30 – environmental damage, and deep hunger for change. There were also many within the governing elite who opposed Abiy’s project. Two people died when, in June 2018, a grenade was thrown at a rally to showcase popular support for the reforms in Addis Ababa’s vast Meskel Square. After the attack, Abiy had advice for his enemies. “Love always wins. Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to divide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded.”
And he appeared ready to turn such sentiments into reality, concluding a historic peace agreement with Eritrea, thus ending one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts and winning the 2019 Nobel peace prize. In Oslo, he called on “my fellow Ethiopians to join hands and help build a country that offers equal justice, equal rights and equal opportunities for all its citizens.” But the Nobel may have been a high point. Since then, problems have multiplied, all exacerbated by the pandemic. His reforms have allowed old ethnic and other grievances to surface, and led to instability, analysts say, with deadly violence earlier this year leading to a wave of repression. Days after the launch last autumn of Abiy’s book outling his national unity philosophy, protesters burned copies in the streets. “Abiy has lost most of his support base in Oromia; he has left the political order in the south deeply disoriented .... and he is now on [the] verge of the unknown with the people of Tigray,” said Lemma. Tigrayan leaders said they were unfairly targeted in corruption prosecutions, removed from top positions and blamed for the country’s problems. The Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front refused to join the party created by Abiy to fuse the elements of the old ruling coalition into a single political organisation. Then, elections due in August were postponed due to Covid. When parliamentarians voted to extend officials’ mandates anyway, Tigrayan leaders went ahead with their own polls. Now each side sees the other as illegitimate, and federal judges have ruled that Abiy’s government should cut off contact with – and funding to – Tigray. But the northern province is home to six million people – 5% of Ethiopia’s 109 million people – and more influential than many other, larger regions. It also has a large paramilitary force and a well-drilled local militia, while a large portion of federal military personnel and much of its equipment is also based there, a legacy of war with Eritrea.
Hostilities now seem to have been opened between Ethiopia’s government and Tigray’s. “Given the strength of Tigray’s security forces, [any] conflict could well be protracted,” the International Crisis Group said in a recent report. There are widespread fears over the destabilising impact of the incipient conflict. UN secretary general António Guterres called on Friday for “an immediate de-escalation of tensions and a peaceful resolution to the dispute”. “The stability of Ethiopia is important for the entire Horn of Africa region,” Guterres said. Ahmed Soliman, at Chatham House in London, said the consequences of a full-blown conflict would be “unspeakable” for Ethiopia and east Africa. “Ethiopia has been experiencing a difficult transition over recent years but remains the diplomatic cornerstone of the region,” he said. Experts point out it would have been impossible for Abiy to move troops against Tigray if Ethiopia was still at war with Eritrea. Now, Isaias Afwerki, the authoritarian leader of Eritrea, is friendly with Abiy and has no affection for Tigrayan leaders. There are unconfirmed reports of the mobilisation of Eritrea’s weak military. The fierce rhetoric from both sides has dampened any hope for a swift end to the standoff. Neither side appear ready to compromise. “If I say ‘I’m going to crush you’, then is there really scope for any negotiation?”, a western diplomat in Addis Ababa said.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1796,"Protect BAME people hit financially by Covid, says UK thinktank",11/8/20,"A leading race equality thinktank has called on the government to do more to protect black, Asian and ethnic minority communities, after a poll added to the growing well of data suggesting their finances have suffered more than those of white Britons due to the coronavirus pandemic. The poll from YouGov found that BAME people are about a third more likely than the white British population to say that their finances have suffered as a result of Covid. BAME respondents to the survey were more likely than white people to say they had been negatively affected with respect to every financial metric they were asked about. While 45% of people from BAME communities said their personal finances had suffered as a result of the pandemic, the figure among white respondents was 34%. BAME people were also more likely to be worried about their job security (54% against 47%) and prospects for career progression (56% against 45%). Alba Kapoor, a policy Officer for the Runnymede Trust, said: “This data is yet more evidence that black, Asian and ethnic minority communities are being left defenceless whilst bearing the brunt of Covid-19. “We already know that black, Asian and ethnic minority people are more likely to work in low-paid, precarious jobs and to live in poverty. It is extremely alarming to see how the pandemic is worsening these pre-existing inequalities. “The government can’t turn a blind eye on this any longer. We urgently need more to protect black, Asian and ethnic minority communities, who face profound financial uncertainty during this time.” The poll of 2,665 people (including 519 BAME) adds to a substantial body of evidence that people from ethnic minorities are being hit disproportionately hard economically by the pandemic. Several studies have shown different ethnicities to be more at risk of contracting and dying from coronavirus than the white British population. An Office for National Statistics analysis published last month linked the greater risk of death to socioeconomic factors, including occupations.
Kapoor added: “The Runnymede Trust is clear that immediate action must be taken to strengthen the social security safety net and increase statutory sickness pay, as well as to address the underlying economic injustices in our society.” Analysis by the Guardian has previously found that BAME workers are overrepresented in the sectors hit worst by the economic crisis caused by Covid. Research by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex, published in June, showed that ethnic minority workers who had seen a drop in their hours during the pandemic were more likely than their white counterparts to have lost their jobs as opposed to being furloughed. The YouGov poll showed people from BAME backgrounds were more likely to be concerned about being able to cope with unexpected expenses such as the boiler breaking down (43% to 34%), affording rent and mortgage payments (29% to 17%), finding the money for council tax (29% against 17%) and bills (28% against 19%). Additionally, 28% of people from BAME communities feared not being able to afford food and clothes, compared with 21% of white people. Matt Palframan, director of financial services research at YouGov said: “While the pandemic has created uncertainty for so many, our data suggests that there are some groups who are feeling the impact more than others.” A Treasury spokesperson said: “We’re doing everything we can to ensure our coronavirus support reaches those who need it the most, across all backgrounds. “We have extended our financial support across the UK to help millions of people continue to provide for their families, and to provide certainty and stability to businesses through the winter.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5

Barcelona’s tiny local bodegas saved for posterity,11/8/20,"Barcelona council has come to the rescue of some of the city’s most emblematic and best-loved bars by adding them to the list of protected sites and buildings. However, thanks to Covid-19 restrictions, you won’t be able to get a drink in any of them for at least the next few weeks. The city has added 11 bodegas to the list of 220 shops that are considered part of the city’s cultural heritage. The move has been widely welcomed, though it comes too late to save many small businesses, from toy and book shops to grocery and furniture stores, that were part of the fabric and essence of the city but were forced out by soaring rents. In most cases they have been replaced by chain stores. Bodegas are distinct from other bars in that, as well as serving food and drink, most also sell house wine, vermouth, sherry and other beverages from the barrel. Many began life as a retail outlet for wine that the owners produced themselves. Several are tiny with barely room for a dozen people to stand at the bar or small tables. The dark wood of the barrels and the tiled floors are part of the rough-and-ready charm of a place that feels like it’s been there for ever.
Brothers David and Carlos Montero are the third generation running Bodega Quimet in Gràcia, a Barcelona neighbourhood that is as traditional as it is trendy. The bodega, one of the 11 listed, has been in business since 1954, and they took it over from the Quimet family 10 years ago. “I think it’s great that the city council is giving us this recognition because we’re part of the fabric of the barrio,” David Montero told the Observer. “If not, it will end up as just another Starbucks. It means that people can come here and eat traditional food such as anchovies, boquerones en vinagre or a plate of jamón. “We’ve never tried to be fashionable or to attract tourists. We’ve never wanted to lose the essence of being a bodega in and for the barrio.” Under Covid-19 restrictions, Quimet can only serve takeaways but Montero says they try to serve the same food as always. “If there’s a special pepper that goes with an octopus dish, we put the pepper in an envelope so the customer can enjoy a Quimet moment at home,” he said.
Most of the bodegas have been listed as “having had an important social influence on their environment and retain aspects of historic interest and originality linked to the uses and customs of the barrio”, and, as such, deserve to be reserved as part of the collective memory. The pandemic has had a catastrophic impact on the hospitality business, and the listed bars are only protected as physical entities, not as going concerns. Montero welcomes the fact that owners have access to funds to maintain the fabric of the bodega but says what is needed more urgently is help with paying the rent. He accepts that closing bars and restaurants may be necessary to stem the spread of the virus but resents the way it has been done, with shutdowns being announced from one day to the next, leaving owners no time to prepare, and landing them with produce they can’t sell. “We had 10 tables, we agreed to reduce it to five, but they gave us three and a half. Then they say people can’t drink at the bar, and now it’s just takeaways. It all feels very improvised,” he said.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1798,"Small earthquake in New England, not much damage",11/8/20,"A small earthquake shook several parts of southern New England on Sunday morning. Officials said no injuries or damage were reported, though some social media posts showed minor harm to buildings. This earthquake, which took place around 9.10am and could be felt in portions of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut, was initially reported as having a magnitude of 4.0. The US Geological Survey changed its assessment shortly thereafter, reporting a magnitude of 3.6, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (Mema) said. “There is NO tsunami danger from this earthquake,” said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tsunami program. The quake’s epicenter was near Bliss Corner, an area of Dartmouth, Massachussetts, and had a depth of 10km. Because the tremor was considered shallow, there was a heightened chance of minor damage and the quake would be expected to be felt across a greater area, NBC Boston reported. Paul Caruso, a USGS geophysicist, told the New York Times: “We wouldn’t expect there to be significant damage from this earthquake. “Earthquakes in this area are commonly felt very far away because the rocks in this area are very contiguous, very old, so they transmit the energy very well from earthquakes.” Caruso told the newspaper southern New England had seen 26 quakes since 1963, but Sunday’s was among the largest. “Living near the air force it really felt like the F-15s were flying under my house,” one Twitter user commented. “My kitties were definitely not happy.” Torry Gaucher, a meteorologist with the US National Weather Service’s Boston office, posted a photo of a crack in his wall and said: “Well that is a new stress crack … bummed that my house felt it but I didn’t since I was in the hot tub.” The New Bedford Fire department advised that anyone who felt the quake needed to check their furnace, gas lines and smokestacks.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1799,Thai police fire water cannon at pro-democracy protesters,11/8/20,"Riot police fired water cannon at crowds of Thai pro-democracy protesters as they attempted to reach Bangkok’s Grand Palace on Sunday to hand-deliver letters urging reform of the country’s powerful monarchy. Demonstrations have spread across Thailand in recent months, led by young people who have risked lengthy jail sentences to call for the power and wealth of the royal family to be curbed, and for the resignation of the prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha. On Sunday evening, water cannon were briefly fired at crowds, but protesters did not vacate the area. Later, demonstrators, who wore goggles and hard hats for protection, moved buses and took down barbed wire that had been used by police to block access to the palace. They carried mock letterboxes, made from old rubbish bins and addressed to the Bureau of the Royal Household, which were filled with messages calling for reform. In a statement addressed to King Maha Vajiralongkorn, protesters said he should listen to “fearless criticisms”, as well as to flattery and praise.
“It does not matter whether the people love the king or not, he must love them all the same. If the king can talk to the people who love him, he must also talk to the people who do not all the same,” it said. It was signed “with power of equal human dignity” by “people”. The statement was a reference to highly unusual comments made by the king last week when, stopped by Channel 4 news and CNN as he walked among royalist supporters, he was asked for his response to the demonstrations. “We love them all the same,” the king said of protesters. Asked if there was room for compromise, he replied: “Thailand is the land of compromise,” before quickly turning away. In their statement, protesters said their demands for reform were “the utmost compromise”. Protesters have breached a longstanding taboo to call for a royal family that is answerable to the public. They say the monarchy’s budget should be reduced and the king’s private funds separated from the crown assets. The king, they say, should not endorse any further coups, nor should the royal family be protected from criticism. According to the constitution, the monarchy is “enthroned in a position of revered worship”. Anyone who “defames, insults or threatens the king, queen, heir apparent or regent” can face up to 15 years in prison. Sunday was the second time police have used water cannon on protesters, who have gathered for largely peaceful rallies for months. Earlier in the day, dozens of royalists held a small counter-rally. A police spokesman told Reuters that water cannon had been fired only as a warning. The Bangkok authority’s emergency unit said one police officer and four protesters were hurt during the brief confrontation outside the palace. At least 84 protesters have been charged since 13 October in connection with the protests. Charges such as sedition, which carries a sentence of up to seven years, have been used against demonstrators. Amnesty International recently said the government was using “vague, overly restrictive laws to harass and silence people”.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1800,Three times as many British voters favour Joe Biden than Donald Trump,11/8/20,"More than three times as many UK voters wanted Joe Biden to win the US election than favoured Donald Trump, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. About 57% of British people chose Biden against just 16% who backed Trump in the presidential election. Even Conservative voters preferred Biden to Trump, with 40% wanting Biden against 28% who favoured the outgoing president. A clear majority of UK voters – 62% – said they believed the US election was generally conducted fairly and properly, with 67% saying that Trump’s claims about electoral fraud were not true. A majority (58%) also said they believed Biden would be positive both for the United States and the world. Meanwhile at home, in the week that a second national lockdown began in England as the government tried to control Covid-19, Labour has opened a four-point lead over the Tories. Labour is up two points, on 42%, compared with a fortnight ago, while the Conservatives are unchanged on 38%. The Liberal Democrats are up one point on 7%.
It is the biggest lead for Labour since Keir Starmer became leader in April and represents a remarkable change in the standing of the two main parties. Early on in the pandemic in March, Boris Johnson and the Tories led Labour by 26 points in an Opinium poll, before the lead was gradually eroded as the government struggled to bring the virus under control. Two-thirds (64%) of people in England say they support the latest four-week lockdown, while only 20% oppose it. However, three in five (62%) think it was implemented too late. While there is broad support for most of the lockdown, some 37% said more sport should be allowed outdoors.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1801,Tories warn Boris Johnson of bigger revolt if there’s a third lockdown,11/8/20,"Senior Tory MPs have warned Boris Johnson that there would be mass revolts in the party and the country against any attempt to extend the national lockdown beyond 2 December as anger grows in Conservative ranks over government handling of the pandemic. Evidence of growing Tory disquiet has risen since it emerged that data produced by No 10 last weekend to back the case for another lockdown exaggerated the potential number of deaths from Covid-19. Last week, the Office for National Statistics also suggested the rate of increases in cases had already started to slow – which many Tory MPs interpreted as meaning the previous regional three-tier approach was beginning to work. Last Wednesday, the government won a Commons vote on imposing lockdown with a majority of 477 after opposition parties including Labour backed the plan. However, 34 Tory MPs voted against the measures while several others, including former leader Theresa May, abstained. The rebellion was fuelled in part by comments from Michael Gove, who refused to rule out a further extension beyond 2 December. In the Commons, May said a rolling series of lockdowns would cause “irreparable damage” to the economy and have a “significant impact on lives”. She and others argued that the three-tier system had not been given adequate time to work. Last night, the chair of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, Sir Graham Brady – who voted against – told the Observer he believed there would be many more rebels if any attempt were made to extend the restrictions. “Some of us voted against lockdown but my sense is that far more would make a stand if a third lockdown were to be contemplated.” Brady said the way government had produced exaggerated figures at last Saturday’s briefing had caused huge disquiet. A slide used to justify the lockdown projected daily deaths reaching 1,500 by December – more than at the peak of the first wave. But government officials later acknowledged it should have shown an upper limit of 1,000 daily deaths – in line with the first-wave peak. Brady added: “It is of serious concern that the data produced to justify this lockdown has begun to unravel so quickly. These are massive restrictions on the liberty and rights of constituents. It is essential parliament should have accurate and sufficient data before decisions are taken.” Johnson has made it clear the new regulations will automatically lapse on 2 December but has stopped short of categorically ruling out a renewal or a fresh future lockdown if the R rate is not brought down to below 1.Labour leader Kier Starmer has made clear that ending the lockdown before the R had fallen to below 1 would be irresponsible. Today the latest Opinium poll for the Observer shows a majority of people in England (64%) support the new lockdown, with a similar proportion (62%) believing it was introduced too late. Only 20% oppose it. The poll suggests many people are sceptical about the current end date, with 58% believing it will be extended beyond 2 December. Only a fifth (19%) think the lockdown will end when planned. When asked about compliance, just under a fifth (18%) say they would break the rules if the lockdown is still in place on Christmas Day. A former Tory cabinet minister now on the backbenches said most Conservative MPs who backed the lockdown did so with serious reservations and fears about the effects it would have on the economy, jobs and people’s mental health. The former minister said there would be “a massive revolt” that would shake Johnson’s authority if a new lockdown was proposed with infections levels anywhere near current levels. Charles Walker, vice-chair of the 1922 committee, said the public had had enough of lockdowns and were making their own decisions on how to deal with the risks. He said: “People have rationalised Covid and are increasingly accepting of living alongside the virus. In March, the public had fled city centres, restaurants and shops two weeks before lockdown. Hours before the second lockdown started, they were laying siege to these very same facilities. There will not be a third lockdown beyond 2 December as the public will not accept it and the government will not have the moral or constitutional authority to impose it.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1802,UK scientists seek  mutant Covid samples from Danish mink farms,11/8/20,"Scientists in the UK are working to secure samples of a mutant form of coronavirus that arose in Danish mink farms and spread into humans, prompting ministers to ban non-UK citizens arriving from Denmark. Danish health authorities raised the alarm over the mutant virus last week and announced a cull of the nation’s 17 million mink as the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) in Copenhagen warned of potentially “serious consequences” for vaccines if it was allowed to spread internationally. Tests in Denmark have picked up more than 200 people with coronavirus mutations linked to mink farms since June, but concern centres on a dozen cases in North Jutland of people who fell ill in September with a unique variant of the virus. Known as “cluster five”, the variant has four separate mutations in the so-called spike protein that the virus uses to enter cells, and on which most vaccines are based.
Researchers at the SSI found that antibodies from people who recovered from coronavirus were less effective at neutralising the mutant strain, but have not made details of their experiments public. There is no evidence that the virus, found on five Danish mink farms, spreads more easily or causes more severe disease in humans than common strains of the virus. While the Danish scientists believe the mutations are concerning because of their potential to make vaccines less effective, one expert told the Guardian the fears were overblown and that the cluster five variant might already have died out in humans. Eight of the dozen cases in Denmark had direct contact with the mink farming industry, with only four identified in the local community. Amid the uncertainty, scientists advising the UK government took part in talks over the weekend to acquire samples of the mutant virus from the Danish authorities. The virus will go through a series of tests to investigate whether or not it evades antibodies from recovered patients and those enrolled in vaccine trials. Further experiments will focus on how well the mutant virus grows in human cells, how well it may spread between humans, and why the mutations arose in the first place. At least six countries, including Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Italy, the Netherlands and the US, have reported outbreaks of coronavirus in mink farms. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the UK government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said the mutations may be nothing more than the virus evolving to spread in mink, but added that it was sensible to shut down the spread “as a matter of caution” until scientists had more evidence. “It could be that the mutations mean something in terms of mink to mink transmission, but are irrelevant to human transmission,” he said. Prof Francois Balloux, the director of UCL’s Genetics Institute said mink are highly susceptible to coronavirus, and since they outnumber humans three to one in Denmark, it was sensible to cull the animals to prevent them fuelling the epidemic. Balloux criticised what he called “alarmist” messaging from Denmark over the threat the mutations posed, and said the cluster five variant may well have died out in humans because it failed to spread effectively. “I really don’t think we should be particularly concerned about them. There are many other mutations not acquired in mink that are more concerning in terms of vaccine escape,” he said. One such mutation, known as N439K, has already been found to confer some resistance to antibodies.
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said there was no evidence the new strain had spread from Denmark to the UK, adding: “While there have been some reports of mink to human transmission, we do not consider this a risk as there are no fur farms in the UK. “We are working closely with international partners to understand the situation in Denmark and we continue to keep the situation under review,” they said.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1803,UK's coronavirus vaccine taskforce chief faces questions over biotech fund,11/8/20,"The head of the government’s vaccine taskforce faces fresh questions after it emerged she hailed the launch of a biotechnology investment fund in her capacity as managing director of a venture capital firm despite having “stepped away” from the role. Kate Bingham, a venture capitalist married to the Conservative minister Jesse Norman, came under scrutiny this week when Labour asked the cabinet secretary to “undertake an urgent and swift investigation” after it was claimed she showed US financiers government documents at a $200-a-head conference. She has garnered further attention after the Times reported that, although Bingham voluntarily declared that SV Health Investors “does not invest in companies related to work on the Covid-19 vaccine”, it has shareholdings in companies named Alchemab and Adimab, which have been involved in the race to develop antibody cocktails.
Separately, in a press release from July – weeks after Bingham was appointed to the role by Boris Johnson in May – she said SV Health Investors was delighted that its first biotechnology-focused fund had attracted significant support. “With many organisations working in unison to achieve the UK’s mission of maintaining a leading position in precision medicine, this felt like the perfect time to launch the IMF,” she said. “As with our other funds, the IMF team will work closely with our portfolio companies to maximise the fund’s potential to transform healthcare and contribute to the UK’s mission.” The shadow health minister, Justin Madders, told the Guardian there was an “extremely concerning pattern of what looks like a cavalier attitude towards the normal standards of probity” and called for greater scrutiny. “We need a complete examination of who is involved here to ensure decisions are being made in the best interests of the UK taxpayer,” he said. “We also need clarity about what is meant by Bingham ‘stepping away’ from her role at SV Health Investors and what safeguards will be in place when she steps down from her role in the taskforce at the end of the year.”
A spokesperson for the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Department (BEIS) said: “Kate Bingham resigned from Alchemab and stepped away from her role at SV Health Investors before she took up her role on the vaccines taskforce. She therefore no longer has knowledge of or influence on the operations of Alchemab or Adimab.” The spokesperson also said neither Alchemab nor Adimab had any interests in the vaccine tender. Bingham is not bound by transparency rules or the parliamentary code of conduct on declaring interests since she is an external appointee, but she reports directly to the prime minister and there have been longstanding calls from many commentators for such appointees to be subject to parliamentary standards. Of her appearance at the conference, the BEIS added: “The fact of her appearance and the content of her presentation received approval from officials at BEIS in line with the process governing such engagements. Bingham focused on publicly available information and said little that expert delegates at the conference could not deduce themselves.” On its website, SV confirms Bingham’s role as vaccine chief is a six-month posting and that she remains its managing partner. The news comes after it emerged that the UK’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, has a £600,000 shareholding in GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical giant contracted to develop a Covid-19 vaccine for the government. He was criticised for not prominently disclosing the interest, but the government said Vallance had no input into contractual and commercial decisions on vaccine procurement and that his shareholding had been declared on the register of interests on the government’s website since he took up the position of chief scientist. SV did not respond to requests for comment. • This article was amended on 8 November 2020 to clarify the criticism of Patrick Vallance with respect to his shares in GSK, and to include the statement that his shareholding was declared on the register of interests.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1804,Vatican enlists bots to protect library from onslaught of hackers,11/8/20,"Ancient intellects are now being guarded by artificial intelligence following moves to protect one of the most extraordinary collections of historical manuscripts and documents in the world from cyber-attacks. The Vatican Apostolic Library, which holds 80,000 documents of immense importance and immeasurable value, including the oldest surviving copy of the Bible and drawings and writings from Michelangelo and Galileo, has partnered with a cyber-security firm to defend its ambitious digitisation project against criminals. The library has faced an average of 100 threats a month since it started digitising its collection of historical treasures in 2012, according to Manlio Miceli, its chief information officer. “We cannot ignore that our digital infrastructure is of interest to hackers. A successful attack could see the collection stolen, manipulated or deleted altogether,” Miceli told the Observer. Cyber attacks were increasing, not slowing down, he added. “Hackers will always try to get into organisations to steal information, to make money or to wreak havoc.” The library, founded in 1451 by Pope Nicholas V, is one of the world’s most important research institutions, containing one of the finest collections of manuscripts, books, images, coins and medals in the world. The digitisation of 41 million pages is intended to “preserve the content of historical treasures without causing damage to the fragile originals”, said Miceli. But he added: “This project is about a lot more than just physical preservation. Swaths of history, previously explored only by white-gloved historians, are now made available to anyone with a internet connection. This is a huge step for educational equality.” So far, about 25% of the library’s documents have been digitised. The project started with “unique, most famous and fragile pieces”, said Miceli. They include one of the world’s oldest manuscripts, an illustrated fragment of Virgil’s Aeneid that dates back 1,600 years. The collection also contains Sandro Botticelli’s 1450 illustration of the Divine Comedy; poems, technical notes and sketches by Michelangelo; ancient manuscripts of the Inca people; and historical treaties and letters.
But, said Miceli, digitisation means “we have to protect our online collection so that readers can trust the records are accurate, unaltered history”. He added: “While physical damage is often clear and immediate, an attack of this kind wouldn’t have the same physical visibility, and so has the potential to cause enduring and potentially irreparable harm, not only to the archive but to the world’s historical memory. In the era of fake news, these collections play an important role in the fight against misinformation and so defending them against ‘trust attacks’ is critical. “Less Hollywood, but still concerning, is a ransomware attack on the library – a well-known attack that infiltrates companies unseen and then locks down files incredibly quickly until you pay a hefty sum. Ransomware today moves at machine-speed, outstripping humans’ ability to spot and stop the attack before it escalates. “These attacks have the potential to impact the Vatican library’s reputation – one it has maintained for hundreds of years – and have significant financial ramifications that could impact our ability to digitise the remaining manuscripts.” The library has partnered with Darktrace, a company founded by Cambridge University mathematicians, which claims to be the first to develop an AI system for cybersecurity. Miceli said: “You cannot throw people at this problem – you need to augment human beings with technology that understands the shades of grey within very complex systems and fights back at machine speed.” AI “never sleeps, doesn’t take breaks and can spot and investigate more threats than any human team could. It makes decisions in seconds about what is strange but benign and strange but threatening.” But, he added, there was no 100% guarantee against attack. “The only way to make an organisation completely secure is to cut it off from the internet. Our mission is to bring the Vatican Library into the 21st century – so we won’t be doing that any time soon.” Dave Palmer, director of technology at Darktrace, said cyber-attackers were constantly looking for ways “to make a quick buck or to cause embarrassment on the global stage”. He added: “Many organisations like the Vatican library have accepted this reality. With AI, they are discovering the subtle, unusual activity that precedes a full-blown attack, and, crucially, trusting AI to fight back on humans’ behalf before it’s too late.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1805,Veterinary workers cull 17 million Danish mink to halt new Covid,11/8/20,"Veterinary workers have begun the gruesome business of gassing and then burning 17 million mink in Danish farms in a bid to halt further spread of a Covid-19 mutation from the animals to humans. The decision to cull the country’s mink population was made after several hundred people became infected with a new strain of Covid-19 that had infected the animals. Researchers have warned this strain could be more resistant to vaccines. Yesterday, Britain banned arrivals from Denmark in an effort to contain the new strain amid fears that another jump by the virus from animals to humans could make Covid-19 even more deadly. Scientists have urged caution about the dangers. “I don’t think we should come to any conclusions about whether this particular mutation is going to impact vaccine efficacy,” said Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO’s chief scientist. “We don’t have any evidence at the moment that it would.” James Wood, professor of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University, agreed: “If the reports of nearly 800 people being infected with the mutated strain are confirmed, it is highly likely this scale of transmission will have been driven by person-to-person transmission rather than from direct mink-to-person transmission. That means culling mink may not in itself cause the strain to disappear, but it may stop further mutant strains from developing in that species.” Five other nations – Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the US – have also reported Covid infections in mink though it is not clear if these have been caused by mutated strains of the virus. Denmark is the world’s biggest producer of mink, and the cull will effectively end that industry, a development that has delighted animal welfare groups. It is also a reasonable precaution, say scientists. “The danger is that the mutated virus could spread back into humans and evade any vaccine response designed to the original, non-mutated version of the spike protein,” said Ian Jones, professor of virology at Reading University. “Of course, the Mink version may not transmit well to man so it’s a theoretical risk but Denmark is clearly taking a precautionary stance so that this possibility is avoided or made much less likely.” Other scientists dismissed the dangers. “I don’t believe that a strain which gets adapted to mink poses a higher risk to humans,” Francois Balloux, director of University College London’s Genetics Institute, told the health website Stat. “We can never rule out anything, but in principle it shouldn’t. It should definitely not increase transmission. I don’t see any good reason why it should make the virus more severe.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1806,Welsh first minister: time is right to end 17-day Covid 'firebreak',11/8/20,"The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said it is the right time for his country to emerge from its 17-day “firebreak” despite sharp rises in Covid cases and the decision by the UK government to begin a lockdown in England. Drakeford said the impact of the Welsh firebreak, which ends on Monday, would not be felt for a week or two but expressed confidence that Wales’s early action means the country will get to Christmas without a further national lockdown. In an interview with the Guardian, the Labour leader in Wales took a swipe at Boris Johnson for repeatedly insisting that an end to the crisis is in sight, claiming this undermined trust. Drakeford said the pandemic had changed the state of the union for ever, but argued it had shown not that Wales should become an independent country but that it already had the powers to make its own decisions. There will be more freedom for people to meet in Wales from Monday when a new set of national rules comes into force and pubs, cafes and restaurants will reopen. But the changes come at a time when there are as many Covid patients in Welsh hospitals as there were in April, and cases in some areas, particularly in parts of the south Wales valleys, have soared. Drakeford said: “Our decision to go for a 17-day firebreak was based on the advice we had at the time. As long as we were really strict about our firebreak, three weekends and two weeks would be enough to suppress the virus. “The impact of the firebreak will not be felt for another week or two, but we continue to follow the science and follow the advice.” Data from Wales’s Techinical Advisory Cell (TAC) suggests people have respected the firebreak with movement back down to the levels seen in May. Drakeford said: “We took a difficult decision, given we were doing it on our own. We struck a bargain with people then if we made it as strict as we needed to, it would last for the 17 days. A lot of people at the time asked, was it necessary? Now I see people saying we haven’t done it for long enough. You have to set out your stall and hold your nerve. Our ambition was to find a pathway through the rest of this calendar year.” Provided people stuck to the firebreak and now follow the new rules, he said the country should be able to get through to Christmas without another national firebreak or lockdown, but he said it was “not helpful” to speculate what may be needed in the new year. “Many more things will emerge we have not thought of,” he said. Drakeford refused to be drawn on when the crisis may be over and criticised Johnson for making over-optimistic predictions. “It will be over when we get a vaccine that offers people more than a modest amount of temporary protection. I think the prime minister has created a problem for himself in terms of trust and credibility by regularly suggesting we’re only a few weeks away from everything being fine again. [He said] it was going to be over in 12 weeks, it was going to be all over before Christmas. “Even when he was announcing the lockdown for England, he couldn’t resist a final flourish in which he claimed it would be over by spring. I think that corrodes people’s confidence in the message. I’m sure it seems attractive at the time for a few moments. In the long term it doesn’t add to the credibility of political leadership. “I don’t want to ever be in the position of saying to people in Wales it’s all just around the corner, this will be over soon. We’re going to have to live with coronavirus for a long time. There’s no magic bullet and I don’t think it helps to suggest to people there is.”
The relationship between Cardiff and Westminster has been fraught at times during the crisis, not least when Wales banned people from Covid hotspots in other parts of the UK. Drakeford said the engagement between the governments had been better in recent days, but he said the crisis had changed the union for ever. “I think it will change the nature of the conversation in Wales. I’m regularly asked about whether there is a rise in enthusiasm for independence in Wales. I think coronavirus has shown that we have a Senedd with its own independent powers and a government that has been prepared to use those powers independently when we have felt it is in Wales’s interest.” The first minister has urged people to follow the new rules – but said this was only part of the job. “We don’t want people to think: ‘How far can I stretch the rules? What can I do? What more can I get away with? Everyone has to ask not what can I do, but what I should do.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1807,What does Bidenâ€™s win mean for Brexit?,11/8/20,"A Joe Biden victory will have “big consequences for Brexit”, those close to the talks on the EU side have said, forcing the UK to think again over its approach to Northern Ireland and threat to disapply the withdrawal agreement. Chris Coons, a close friend of Biden and a potential US secretary of state, told the BBC that Biden will want to “reimagine” the US’s transatlantic policy, the special relationship with the UK and its relationship with the EU, damaged by Donald Trump. On Northern Ireland, he warned: “I would expect to be concerned about making sure that the Good Friday accords are respected and protected and that the ways in which the UK-EU terms are negotiated doesn’t put at risk the stability of the border terms in Northern Ireland”. There is speculation that Biden’s first visit to Europe could be to Brussels and not London, Berlin or Paris, a clear sign that that the US wants to rebuild its relationship with Europe and repair the damage wrought by Trump in Nato, which is headquartered in Brussels, and through trade wars with Germany. And there will be a reset in the approach of the US on trade talks with the UK. Biden was Barack Obama’s vice-president who warned the UK would be at the back of the queue over Brexit. But he has more recently made his views clear – warning that if the UK government opts for no deal and in doing so carries out its threat to override parts of the the withdrawal agreement signed in January relating to the Northern Ireland protocol, there will be no trade deal with the UK. In September, he said the Good Friday agreement, which ended decades of bloody conflict in the region, cannot be “a casualty of Brexit”. “Any trade deal between the US and UK must be contingent upon respect for the agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period,” he said. His views on the internal market bill will not, however, translate into a total reset for US-UK trade talks. Georgie Wright, of the Institute for Government, says that if anything, Brexit will spur on the US to strike a trade deal with the UK as it could be a means of prizing open the door again for a trade deal with the EU. Those on the EU side say both the US and Brussels have huge teams of negotiators and would have the capacity to run multiple talks. “Trade is not top of the US agenda at the moment. After four years of the ‘America first’ doctrine, the Republicans don’t want any more trade deals, and the Democrats aren’t too hot on them either,” said Wright. “It is hard to see how Biden would get a trade deal through Congress and a Republican Senate. But, it does see one advantage to a trade deal with the UK – and that is the possibility of gaining a foothold in Europe which it could use as a way of extracting more access from the EU. The thinking goes ‘if the UK, which has similar standards, accepts our goods – why can’t the EU market?’”she said. Anthony Gardner, a former American ambassador to the EU, recently told an audience in Germany that while Brexit was bad, Biden valued the transatlantic relationship with Europe and with the UK. “Here’s a dramatic difference: Donald Trump has only believed that the US-UK link was important, he was a cheerleader for Brexit. Joe Biden believes that the triangle of relationships, US-UK, UK-EU, US and EU, all have to work together, and you will see statements to that effect,” said Gardner.",,Politics,Guardian,5

1821,His speech was perfect': Chinese social media users celebrate Biden win,11/9/20,"While China’s top officials remained conspicuously silent on Joe Biden’s presidential victory over Donald Trump, Chinese residents celebrated and held out cautious optimism for improved US-China ties. On Monday, Biden’s speech after being declared the projected winner was among the most viewed topics on social media, with the hashtag “Biden national address” viewed more than one billion times on Weibo. “This is how a president should behave,” one user said. “I watched his speech all the way through and it was perfect,” another said. “It was very wise of him to emphasise cooperation to avoid possible riots by [Trump’s] refusal to concede the election,” another said. Others agreed with Biden’s pledge to make defeating the Covid-19 virus his top priority, with a transitional task force to be announced on Monday. In Beijing, patrons waited in line to eat at a noodle shop that Biden visited in 2011.
Chinese media carried reports on Biden’s personal story, including the deaths of his first wife, daughter and son. Several noted his path from being the youngest US senator to the oldest president. “Very persistent,” one commentator said underneath a video of his long career in public office and multiple attempts to run for president. In response to reports that Biden visited the grave of his son after being named the the winner, internet users were sympathetic. Some quoted a line from a Song dynasty poem, from the perspective of a father lamenting the loss of his motherland to invaders, writing: “The day the troops retake and set the north lands free. Do not forget to tell me at my grave the good news.” Few presidents have elicited as strong of a reaction in China as Trump, whose victory in 2016 was met with a brief honeymoon phase as people saw him as a pragmatic businessman who would put ideology aside. Under the Trump administration, ties between Washington and Beijing have reached their lowest point in decades, marked by criticism and competition across several issues from human rights to technology and trade.
Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization, a thinktank in Beijing, said he believed Biden would adopt a multilateral approach in engaging with China. “Under Biden’s administration China and the US will engage in many forms of dialogue and discussion that will stabilise the situation,” he said. China’s caution in congratulating Biden may stem from uncertainty over how his administration will approach the US-China relationship. Wang Wenbin, spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry said on Monday that Beijing had “noted that Mr Biden has announced his successful election”, but declined to say more. During the campaign Biden said that the US “does need to get tough with China”. In the last presidential debate he described Chinese leader Xi Jinping as a “thug”. His campaign has described the Chinese government’s actions in Xinjiang as genocide, going further than other critics. Analysts say that while Biden is more likely to a more measured approach, the relationship between China and the US has fundamentally changed since the Obama administration in which Biden served. “To a considerable degree, Biden’s advisers have come to share a pessimistic view of China’s intentions that is not all that different from that of the Trump administration,” said Aaron Friedberg, professor of politics and international Affairs at Princeton University. “Although it will adopt different approaches in certain respects a Biden administration will not reverse the overall direction of US policy.” Chinese state media, which described the US election system as “disastrous”, has also reported on the deep division in US society, characterised by competing groups celebrating and protesting in the streets and the need for police to be dispatched. The editor of the Global Times, Hu Xijin said in a video that China had not congratulated Biden on the election in order to maintain distance from the race and US politics. He wrote on Weibo: “This will be the most turbulent and uncertain transition period in the United States … China must be prepared.” Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1822,Super rare' 100-year-old carrier pigeon message found in France,11/9/20,"A couple out for a walk in eastern France have discovered a tiny capsule containing a message despatched by a Prussian soldier over a century ago using a carrier pigeon. The message from an infantry soldier based at Ingersheim, written in German in a barely legible hand, detailed military manoeuvres apparently during the first world war and was addressed to a superior officer, said Dominique Jardy, curator of the Linge Museum at Orbey in eastern France. The date is marked 16 July but the year is not perfectly clear, appearing to be written as either 1916 or 1910. The first world war took place from 1914 to 1918.
The message reads: “Platoon Potthof receives fire as they reach the western border of the parade ground, platoon Potthof takes up fire and retreats after a while. “In Fechtwald half a platoon was disabled. Platoon Potthof retreats with heavy losses.” At the time, Ingersheim – now in France’s Grand Est department – was part of Germany. A couple found the tiny capsule with its well-preserved contents in September this year in a field in Ingersheim, said Jardy, who raved about the “super rare” discovery. They brought it to the nearest museum, the one at Orbey dedicated to one of the bloodiest battles of the first world war. Jardy had enlisted the help of a German friend to decrypt the message, he said. The tiny piece of paper and capsule will become part of the museum’s permanent display.

1823,The fight goes on': exiled former president Evo Morales returns to Bolivia,11/9/20,"Thousands of flag-waving supporters have greeted Evo Morales at Bolivia’s southern border, as the country’s exiled former president began a triumphant homecoming that suggests his four-decade political career may be far from over. “As long as capitalism and imperialism exist, the fight goes on,” Morales, 61, declared as he prepared to cross the international bridge between the Argentinian border town of La Quiaca and Villazón in Bolivia at about 10am local time.
“There are thousands of Bolivians waiting to embrace Evo on the other side of this bridge … and do you know why? Because the people never get it wrong,” said Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, after escorting Morales to the border crossing. “Viva Bolivia! Viva Latin America!” he added. In Villazón Morales told a crowd of miners and indigenous citizens: “We have recovered our democracy, without violence, and we have once again reclaimed our homeland.” Bolivia’s first indigenous president resigned and fled Bolivia on 11 November last year after an explosion of social unrest and what backers denounced as an anti-indigenous coup. He initially sought shelter in Mexico but has spent most of the last year in Argentina where Fernández’s leftwing administration offered him asylum.
On Monday morning, Morales kicked off a high-profile road trip home, a day after Bolivia’s new leftwing president, Luis Arce, was sworn in following a landslide election in October. From Villazón, the 61-year-old politician plans to lead a caravan of vehicles northwards to the jungle province of Chapare and the town of Chimoré where he began his political life as a union leader for coca farmers, known as cocaleros. En route, the homecoming former leader is expected to pass through towns and villages arriving at Oruro on Tuesday and continuing to Orinoca, the tiny village where his birthplace has been transformed into a $7m museum honouring Morales. Morales has said the social movements there will decide if he continues to be a leader or not.
In an video message celebrating his return from exile, Morales pledged to continue fighting for democracy and Latin America. “But, above all, I will not rest until sealing a national pact that, leaving aside sectoral and regional interests, gets Bolivia out of its crisis,” he said. “The people have won,” Morales added. Those comments will delight supporters but may fuel fears within Bolivia’s opposition, and even some sectors of Morales’s Movement For Socialism (Mas) party, over the extent to which the former president will seek to involve himself in Bolivian politics after his return. Morales’s defenders hail him for the economic and social progress made during his 14 years in power. But Bolivia’s former president is also a divisive and in some quarters despised figure who detractors accuse of leading the country towards authoritarianism, corruption and refusing to give up power. When he was forced into exile last year, Morales had been trying to secure an unprecedented fourth term as president, in defiance of a 2016 referendum where voters decided he should not have that right. Jim Shultz, the founder of the Bolivia-focused Democracy Centre, said it was not clear what, if any political ambitions Morales still harbours, or how Arce felt about his return. Speaking to the Guardian last week, Arce called Morales’s return “a very personal matter for him” but insisted: “This is my government.” Shultz said Arce’s challenge would be to find Morales a role “where he feels honoured and respected as opposed to really controlling anything”. “That’s probably the sweet landing spot – that you find a role for him that is constructive, that captures his strengths but that keeps him out of the power structure of the government and out of the power dynamic of the Mas,” he added.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1824,BioNTech's Covid vaccine: a shot in the arm for Germany's Turkish community,11/9/20,"When the German biotechnology company BioNTech picked a street called An der Goldgrube or At the Goldmine in the western city of Mainz for its headquarters, the couple behind it could not have predicted how prophetic the address would turn out to be. The company’s shares shot up 23.4% on Monday morning after the Covid-19 vaccine it is developing with the US pharma giant Pfizer became the first candidate worldwide to show positive results in phase 3 trials, the crucial final stage of testing. The total value of BioNTech’s stock is currently $21.9bn (£16.6bn), more than four times that of German national carrier Lufthansa and a triumph for a company that only made its debut on the US stock market a year ago.
Founded in 2008 by the married scientists Özlem Türeci and Ugur Sahin and the Austrian oncologist Christoph Huber, the company originally set out to develop new types of immunotherapy against cancer, modifying patients’ T cells to target cancer-specific antigens. When news of the coronavirus first surfaced at the start of the year, BioNTech, which employs 1,300 people, was quick to reallocate its resources. Sahin, its CEO, told Germany’s Manager Magazin that when he read about the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan in January, he told his wife that “in April they’ll have to shut the schools here”. Germany entered its first lockdown in March, earlier than Sahin had anticipated, but by then his company had already developed 20 candidates for a vaccine, of which it would go on to test five for immune reactions in a research programme accompanied by 500 scientists called Lightspeed.
Sahin said in an interview in late October that the company could have managed to develop a vaccine on its own, but it would have struggled with the challenge of distribution. Pfizer, which has collaborated with BioNTech on flu vaccines since 2018, paid $185m upfront toward the development of the coronavirus vaccine. It will release another $563m when the development is complete. Monday’s milestone of interim results showing 90% efficacy is a triumph for Pfizer’s and BioNTech’s scientific method. Their vaccine pioneers an entirely new technology that involves injecting part of the virus’s genetic code in order to train the immune system. In a country where a debate about the willingness of German citizens with Turkish roots to integrate into public life has never been far from the headlines for the last decade, the story of BioNTech’s founders is also salient. Türeci and Sahin are children of Turkish Gastarbeiter or “guest workers” who came to Germany in the late 1960s. Sahin was born in southern Turkey but moved to Cologne when he was four. Türeci, the company’s chief medical officer, was born in Lower Saxony.
The couple, who hold German citizenship and have a teenage daughter, met at Saarland University in Homburg and have been married since 2002. In an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung, Türeci said she and her husband started their wedding day in lab coats and resumed their research after a brief dash to the registry office. The Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel wrote that their success was “balm for the soul” of Germans with Turkish roots after decades of being stereotyped as lowly educated greengrocers. The year 2020 also marks the 10th anniversary of the publication of Germany Does Away With Itself, a book in which a former government official argued that Turkish migrants were dumbing down education standards in the country.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1825,Boris Johnson to press on with Brexit bill despite Lords defeat,11/9/20,"Boris Johnson has put himself on a collision course with the Joe Biden administration in the US after Downing Street said it would press ahead with legislation designed to override the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. Peers inflicted a huge defeat on the government after voting overwhelmingly to remove measures that seek to “disapply” parts of the Northern Ireland protocol – measures that Biden has said would put the Good Friday agreement at risk. Lords voted 433 to 165 on the amendment tabled by Lord Eames, the former primate of all Ireland, who spoke movingly of the fragile peace in Northern Ireland. Northern Irish peer Lord Empey blamed the “mess” on Boris Johnson’s decision to opt for the border down the Irish Sea last year, a decision Ken Clarke said was one of the most “inferior” options available to the government, which, he said, was now acting like a dictatorship to remedy its errors. No 10 reacted to the defeat by saying: “We will retable these clauses when the bill returns to the Commons.” Just before the vote result came in Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, warned that there would be no Brexit trade deal if the UK passed a bill “designed to break international law”.
He later told BBC’s Newsnight programme he thought a deal was still possible but said the bill had damaged trust with the EU and Britain’s reputation internationally. “Anybody who is suggesting that this has been a successful or a good tactic ... doesn’t understand the conversations that are happening across the EU right now. This is a tactic that has backfired I think in a significant way,” he said. Lord Judge, a former chief justice of England and Wales, opened the Lords debate on the amendment on Monday by describing the Brexit clauses as “pernicious, lamentable provisions” that had no other purpose than to give unilateral powers to Downing Street to “nullify” international law. The government has previously said the clauses would break international law in a “specific and limited way”. Judge said the clauses had not been inserted as “guardian angels, pure and unsullied” into legislation aimed at smoothing trade between Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England after Brexit. “The executive is seeking powers that parliament should never have been asked to give,” said Judge, predicting an “overwhelming” majority for the amendment to demonstrate the Lords’ discontent with the government.
Downing Street and senior cabinet members including the environment secretary, George Eustice, on Monday, and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, on Sunday, reiterated their insistence that the clauses were necessary to give domestic power over the EU if it threatened the Good Friday agreement. In a pre-recorded lecture to Middle Temple on Monday evening, the former prime minister Sir John Major urged parliament to resist aspects of the bill, which he said threatened fundamental liberties and allowed ministers to break the law – a “slippery slope down which no democratic government should ever travel”. He added that the bill had “damaged our reputation around the world” and warned of the “corrosive” impact of placing ministers above the law. Lord Clarke, the former home secretary and chancellor, told the House of Lords there was no evidence for the supposed EU threat to the Good Friday agreement – describing the Brexit clauses as a “Donald Trump like gesture” born of “panic” by a government acting like a dictatorship. Michael Howard, a former Tory leader and an ardent Brexit supporter, said he was “dismayed” that a party he had “supported for so long” had “chosen as one of the first assertions of its newly won sovereignty to break its word, to break international law, to renege on a treaty signed barely a year ago”. In a sombre speech, Robin Eames, a former primate of All Ireland, who authored the amendment, said peace in Northern Ireland and mutual understanding of previous warring communities was “still a tender plant” that was being put at risk by the bill. Margaret Ritchie, a former SDLP leader, said Raab had “totally misrepresented” the situation in comments on the BBC on Sunday when he claimed that the EU was trying to undermine the Good Friday agreement. It was “the EU that sought and is seeking to protect the Belfast agreement through the NI protocol”, she said. As recently as September, Biden said the Good Friday agreement, which ended decades of bloody conflict in the region, could not be allowed to become “a casualty of Brexit”. He said then: “Any trade deal between the US and UK must be contingent upon respect for the agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period.” The UK government has admitted the legislation breaches part of the Northern Ireland protocol as set out in the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU. The clauses would hand sweeping unilateral powers to ministers in two key areas yet to be agreed with the EU, breaching the terms of the treaty agreed in January. It would give ministers the power to change or disapply export rules for goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland, and also give them power over whether to notify Brussels of any state aid decisions. Eustice confirmed again on Monday that the government would reinstate the clauses that enable ministers to break international laws if they are rejected by the Lords. Downing Street said it was acting responsibly in order to allow a smooth transition should no deal be reached with the EU. “Any Lords amendments will be considered when they return to the Commons but we do consider these clauses to be a vital safety net,” Johnson’s spokesman said.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1826,Brexit: Lords inflict huge defeats on government in votes on internal market bill — as it happened,11/9/20,"Following the defeat of key parts of proposed Brexit legislation in the Lords, a government spokesperson said: We are disappointed that the House of Lords has voted to remove clauses from the UK internal market bill, which was backed in the House of Commons by 340 votes to 256 and delivers on a clear Conservative manifesto commitment. We will retable these clauses when the bill returns to the Commons. Weâ€™ve been consistently clear that the clauses represent a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UKâ€™s internal market and the huge gains of the peace process. We expect the House of Lords to recognise that we have an obligation to the people of Northern Ireland to make sure they continue to have unfettered access to the UK under all circumstances.

1827,"Brexit: UK risks being 'international pariah' under Biden, says Labour",11/9/20,"The UK risks becoming “an international pariah” and endangering relations with the US under Joe Biden, Labour has said, after ministers pledged to press ahead with a plan to break international law by potentially rewriting parts of the Brexit withdrawal deal. Lord Falconer, the shadow attorney general, said the government was “in a big hole” over its internal market bill, which the House of Lords is expected to amend this week to remove the contentious proposals. George Eustice, the environment secretary, reiterated on Monday that if this did happen ministers would ask MPs to reinstate the relevant clauses. The government was “committed to the spirit of the withdrawal agreement”, he said. Biden, who has Irish roots, has expressed concern about the UK’s proposal to unilaterally amend an international agreement, and the potential impact on the Good Friday agreement if there ends up being a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Falconer, told Sky the government should “stop and think”. He said: “What on earth is the point of making the United Kingdom an international pariah, just at the moment a new president of the United States emerges saying, not only do I want the British government to comply with the Northern Ireland protocol, but I want a law-abiding world?
“To make ourselves an international outsider, somebody who will become low down the list of the people who the United States will want to do business with, is a very big mistake for the United Kingdom. “The House of Lords is doing the government a favour by seeking to take out these lawbreaking provisions. It gets the government off the hook. I would suggest the government stop digging – they’re in a big hole.” Pushing ahead with the plans would mean Biden was “not going to entertain negotiations” over a rapid post-Brexit US-UK trade deal, Falconer said. Speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown said Biden would prefer the UK to have stayed in the EU. Brown said: “He is also worried about the Good Friday agreement – he is not going to allow a trade deal with Britain to happen if we in some way breach the Good Friday agreement.” Eustice told Today that any worries about the internal market bill in the US would be unfounded. He said: “If it was understood exactly what this bill was about, rather than how it is sometimes caricatured – this is about about providing legal clarity, legal certainty, and protecting the internal market in the UK, and crucially, standing behind the Belfast agreement.” Eustice denied the government was reneging on the agreement to carry out some checks on goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK so as to keep the Irish border open. “We’re not,” he said. “Northern Ireland officials are working on the facilities that will be needed to do those checks, particularly on agri-foods goods, as they enter Northern Ireland. A lot of work is being done as well on the customs procedures that will be needed for goods at risk of entering the EU market. “We are absolutely committed to the spirit of the withdrawal agreement, and we’re already implementing it.” But Eustice stressed the government would seek to reinstate any elements of the bill removed by peers. He told Sky News: “We will. The UK internal market bill is not about undermining the Belfast agreement. It’s about standing behind it, and making sure that it works, and looking after the interests of Northern Ireland, making sure that the peace and stability that’s been hard won there can carry on.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1828,"Bugles, shootouts, trains? Covid vaccine hopes prompt strained analogies",11/9/20,"If Monday’s Downing Street press conference had been a jug, and the tortured metaphors had been water, the cleaners at No 10 would have needed to get the mops out afterwards. Here’s a selection of the most strained analogies served up by Boris Johnson and the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jonathan Van-Tam: Johnson We have talked for a long time, or I have, about the distant bugle of the scientific cavalry coming over the brow of the hill. And tonight that toot of the bugle is louder. But it is still some way off. Van-Tam This is like … getting to the end of the play-off final, it’s gone to penalties, the first player goes up and scores goal. You haven’t won the cup yet, but what it does is it tells you that the goalkeeper can be beaten. Johnson Mass testing and the vaccine are vital arrows in our epidemiological quiver. Van-Tam We’ve seen the swallow but this is very much not the summer. It would be a colossal mistake for any of us to relax at this point. Johnson I remain buoyantly optimistic about the prospects of this country next year. I just don’t want to let people run away with the idea that this development is today is necessarily a home run, a slam dunk, a shot to the back of the net, yet. Van-Tam This, to me, is like a train journey where you’re standing on the station – it’s wet, windy, it’s horrible – and two miles down the tracks, two lights appear and it’s the train. And it’s a long way off. We’re at that point at the moment. That’s the efficacy result. Then we hope the train slows down safely to get in to the station. That the safety data. And then the train stops. And at that point the doors don’t open. The guard has to make sure it’s safe to open the doors. That’s the MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency], that’s the regulator. And, when the doors open, I hope there’s not an unholy scramble for the seats. The JCVI [joint committee on vaccination and immunisation] has very clearly said which people are going to need the seats most and they are the ones who should get on the train first.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1829,Church of England could rethink stance on LGBTQ+ issues by 2022,11/9/20,"The Church of England could make a historic change to traditional teaching on sexuality in less than two years after bishops promised that decisions on issues that have riven the church for decades would be taken in 2022. The self-imposed deadline could end with clergy being permitted to conduct same-sex marriages – or the church could opt to reinforce traditional teaching on marriage, sexuality and gender. At the moment, the church does not allow same-sex marriage, and does not officially bless same-sex civil marriages. Gay clergy are permitted to be in relationships so long as they are celibate. LGBTQ+ rights campaigners say that some parishes are unwelcoming or hostile, and in some cases there has been emotional or spiritual abuse. The bishops’ move came as a three-year mission to examine issues of sexuality and identity proposed further “engagement and learning” by parishes. The church has already experienced years of intense internal discussion and intractable divisions over the issues, and there have been repeated debates and discussions at the church’s ruling body, the General Synod. The Living in Love and Faith project produced a “suite of learning resources” – including a book, videos, podcasts and a course – aimed at helping church members understand questions about human identity and sexuality, social attitudes and Christian thinking. About 40 people drew up the material, which parishes will be encouraged to explore and discuss. The group included five openly LGBTQ+ people. Christopher Cocksworth, the bishop of Coventry, who led the project, said the material recognised that some people in the church thought traditional doctrine was “ripe for development”. Asked whether it could lead to a vote at synod on same-sex marriage, he said the resources would “help the church eventually to face that sort of question”. In a foreword to the book, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, and Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, apologised for the “huge damage and hurt” caused to LGBTQ+ people within the church. Jayne Ozanne, a prominent campaigner for LGBTQ+ rights within the C of E, warned that the outcome of the decision promised by bishops was uncertain, and that further delay for yet more discussion meant more people would face rejection and harm. “While it’s good to hear that decisions may finally be afoot in two years’ time, we must act now to safeguard LGBT people in our care. We cannot go on acknowledging and apologising for the harm church teaching is causing without recognising the safeguarding responsibilities we have. Too many lives are at risk,” she said. Julian Henderson, the bishop of Blackburn and president of the conservative Church of England Evangelical Council, said: “While discussions about these issues are always welcome … this is actually about obedience to scripture.” He added: “To all those in the C of E who are unsettled by suggestions that the church might decide, in the future, to depart from historic orthodoxy … we will uphold what Christians have always believed through history and what the overwhelming majority of Christians globally still believe.” Living in Love and Faith was set up after the synod threw out a report by bishops in 2017 upholding traditional teaching.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1830,Concern over French bill that cracks down on photos identifying police,11/9/20,"A proposed bill in France that would make it illegal to disseminate photographs or videos identifying police and gendarmes “with intent to harm” is a danger to press freedom, critics have warned. The measure comes amid growing concern about allegations of police violence in the country. It is outlined in draft global security legislation to be presented to the Assemblée Nationale next week. Article 24 of the bill would introduce up to a year in prison and a maximum €45,000 (£41,000) fine for “disseminating by any means or medium whatsoever, with the aim or harming their physical or psychological integrity, the image of the face or any other identifying element of an officer of the national police or member of the national gendarmerie when engaged in a police operation”. This clause states the officer must be identifiable and the intention of disseminating the video must deliberately and directly seek to harm them. Intent to cause harm would be difficult to prove in the case of journalists covering demonstrations or police operations, and there is concern it could lead to searches at journalists’ homes and offices and examination of emails and social media accounts in the search for evidence. Reporters Sans Frontières (RSF) said the article in the draft law was based on a “slippery concept” because intent was “open to interpretation and hard to determine”. “A scathing social media post about police violence or criticism of the police in emails could be exploited in an attempt to demonstrate an intent to harm. It is impossible to know the degree to which such evidence might influence individual judges and convince them that there was a clear intent to harm,” RSF wrote in a statement. RSF has requested clear guarantees that the proposed law would not enable police to arrest journalists while filming or prevent journalists and news media publishing or broadcasting images of police officers. France’s independent “defender of rights”, Claire Hédon, said the legislation could pose “considerable risks” on information freedom and privacy. Hédon said she was “particularly preoccupied by restrictions envisaged concerning the dissemination of images of security forces agents in the exercise of their duty”. There have been a number of high-profile cases involving the police recently, including the death of delivery driver Cédric Chouviat, who said “I’m suffocating” seven times as police pinned him to the ground earlier this year. French law and order forces were also criticised for their use of rubber bullets, water cannon and teargas against gilets jaunes (yellow vests) demonstrations. In September the journalist and film director David Dufresne released the documentary Un Pays qui se Tient Sage about police violence. Recently, France’s law and order forces have been filmed using batons and teargas against protesting students and journalists. The interior ministry says the law aims to protect police and gendarmes who have been increasingly targeted and threatened. Three police officers were killed in the January 2015 attacks in Paris, and in 2016 a police commander and his partner were killed in their home at Magnanville, outside the French capital, in front of their toddler son. The assailant, who claimed allegiance to Islamic State, streamed a video of the knife attack on Facebook Live. About 40 journalist organisations have signed a statement asking the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, to remove the clauses in the proposed law likely to “undermine the freedom to inform”. Emmanuel Vire, the secretary general of the French national union of journalists (SNJ-CGT), told Le Monde the law was “liberticide”. “We have the impression of being attacked from everywhere,” he said.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1831,Could a Covid vaccine bring back normality?,11/9/20,"England is back in lockdown. It happened not a moment too soon. As of 2 November almost three-quarters of a million new cases have been officially counted since 21 September, when the government’s scientific advisory committee Sage advised lockdown. On that day, Britain had only had about 360,000 cases since Covid arrived. Now the figure is three times that. So many more cases mean it will take longer, and possibly require tougher social restrictions, to get numbers down by imposing lockdown than it would have in September, says James Naismith, head of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford. Naismith calculates that we will have 500 deaths per day in two to three weeks because of the cases that occurred over the past week, compared with an average of 144 in the week ending 2 November. But it could be far worse. If we had done nothing for another two weeks, he says, we’d be looking at 1,000 deaths a day by Christmas – and more, if hospitals fill up and not everyone can get optimal treatment. “No one is saying lockdowns are not harmful, they will cause misery and death,” says Naismith. “Being poorer as a country means we will be unhealthier. We know despair and isolation take lives. We know delays in treating some (non-Covid) diseases will increase deaths.” It is clear, however, that Covid-19 is far deadlier, he says. But beating it back means people must follow the lockdown rules, and more closely than many did in spring. And that will be easier if there is a light at the end of this tunnel. The brutal truth is that Boris Johnson’s pledge in July that Covid would be “over by Christmas” is as illusory as that promise proved back in the first world war. But we know that places that acted fast and forcefully enough to get infection down to low levels early on, then kept it there, with some distancing but also effective testing, tracing and quarantine, have been able to return to a degree of normality. Life is largely normal in New Zealand; the South Korean test and trace response is widely regarded as the benchmark; Taiwan recently celebrated 200 days without a case; Vietnam hasn’t added to its death count of 35 since 5 September, and China, source of the virus, has so far avoided a second wave. But given that the UK’s test and trace system is so shambolic, we appear to be relying on a vaccine to bail us out. Sadly, it’s more complicated than that. Even once discovered, manufactured and distributed, it won’t banish the virus immediately, says Prof David Salisbury of Imperial College London, a former director of immunisation at the Department of Health. We will still need some distancing, and testing and quarantine to keep outbreaks under control. But we may not be condemned to the life we’re living now. Vaccines A vaccine may not be enough on its own, but it is necessary. It is the only proven way to reach “herd immunity” – when so many of the population (thought to be at least 60% for Covid-19) are immune to the virus that an infected person contacts very few non-immune people and, unable to find new hosts, the virus dies out.
Letting the virus rip through a population with less immunity – as advocated by the so-called Great Barrington Declaration and others – would kill thousands who would have been saved if we had slowed the spread of the virus before the vaccine arrived, overwhelm the NHS and leave many people dealing with the misery of “long Covid” for years to come. We will know before the year’s end whether some of the 11 vaccines now in large-scale trials actually work. The US-based firm Pfizer and its partners are among the farthest along the track, partly because their vaccine is made of mRNA that codes for a virus protein, which is quick to produce. Pfizer has nearly completed signing up 44,000 people for its vaccine, which requires two jabs three weeks apart. Half will receive a placebo. It hopes that by late November sufficient numbers of the participants will have caught Covid, and significantly fewer of them will have had the vaccine than a placebo. If there are so few that it shows the vaccine made people half as likely to get the disease, the vaccine will meet the minimum level of effectiveness set by the US regulatory agencies. If there are so few that it shows the vaccine protected 77% of recipients, the trial will stop, as it would not be ethical to keep giving people placebo – and approval can get under way. In documents shared last week the head of the UK vaccine task force Katie Bingham revealed that the plan is to offer a vaccine to all adults over 50 by Easter next year. Then what? Say the first vaccines protect 70% of the people who get them, and 70% of the population is vaccinated – and both of those are ambitious targets. That means 49% of the population will be protected, says David Salisbury. Herd immunity requires more than that. It may even be difficult to vaccinate that many, if side-effects such as fatigue, however mild or temporary, set in after the first jab and some refuse the second. But current UK vaccination plans don’t aim for herd immunity at first. The most recent advice calls for “targeted” vaccination of people most at risk: frontline workers such as medical staff, and people who are older or have medical conditions such as diabetes, who are most likely to contract severe disease. Vaccinating those people would cut severe cases, deaths and hospital demand, but they don’t number enough to reach herd immunity. “The virus will continue to circulate among younger healthy people, especially if they ignore social distancing and won’t wear masks,” says Salisbury – at least until more people are vaccinated. We will need what he calls “Vaccine Plus”, masks and some distancing, to keep this circulation in check – and stop it reaching the 30% of vaccinated, high-risk people who aren’t protected by the vaccine.
Moreover, warns Peter Hotez of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, the first vaccines might stop vaccinated people getting sick, but not prevent them catching and transmitting the virus. “In that case we’ll still require masks and social distancing, until better vaccines come along,” he says. Some immunologists think that is not all bad. If young children – who do not usually get so sick from Covid as adults – start catching the virus every winter we may develop enough immunity, if not to stop the virus circulating then at least to limit its impact. In a generation, everyone will have had it as children, and Covid will be mild. That may be what happened with the four coronaviruses that now cause common colds in winter. Genetic analysis shows one, OC43, left cattle and entered humans around 1890. It may be what really caused a pandemic that year of what we thought was severe flu, says Nicholas Christakis of Yale University, but which we now realise had Covid-like symptoms. Drugs In any case, the immediate effect of the vaccine should be fewer people dying but the virus still circulating at some level. This could be easier to face with some effective drugs to tame the sporadic cases. Monoclonal antibodies are artificially made proteins similar to the ones our own immune systems make, but usually too late in the disease to save us. Several are under development, and the monoclonal made by US firm Eli Lilly was used to treat President Trump. Results have been mixed. Trials of the drug in hospitalised Covid patients ended in late October, when no improvements were seen. It is still being tested in less severe cases. One severe-case trial of a cocktail of two monoclonals made by US firm Regeneron has also been halted, although that drug is still being tested in the UK Recovery trial. Recovery has so far mostly tested “re-purposed” drugs already approved to treat other conditions. As these have passed safety trials, they are a fast way to treat a new disease if they turn out to work for that too. So far, Recovery has found that two such hopefuls do not work on Covid: the hydroxychloroquine championed by the White House, and a mix called lopinavir/ritonavir, at least in severe disease. A long-used anti-inflammatory drug, dexamethasone, did turn out to help in late Covid, when most damage is done by runaway inflammation, a reaction of the immune system. Recovery also plans to test tocilizumab, a monoclonal that blocks inflammation. University College London is similarly testing existing antiviral drugs favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir early in the disease.
Recovery is also testing blood serum containing antibodies to Covid from people who have survived it. Paul Morgan of the University of Cardiff has high hopes for drugs that block the over-activation of an immune system called complement, a feature of severe Covid. Preliminary small-scale trials of existing anti-complement drugs in the Netherlands have been promising. There were several specific anti-coronavirus drugs in the works after the first Sars virus in 2003 that block bits of viral machinery. But Sars was eradicated with tracing and quarantine – it spread more clumsily than Covid. With no market for coronavirus drugs, research funding stopped despite warnings from scientists that the viruses remained a threat. Some researchers are trying to revive these efforts. “We need to develop countermeasures that can keep people from getting severely ill,” says Amesh Adalja of Johns Hopkins University. “I don’t think things will get completely back to normal, if that means to a pre-pandemic level,” he adds. “There will be some social distancing that will have to continue,” at least until a second-generation of vaccines arrives that prevents all transmission. Testing We also need better diagnostics. Some countries, notably South Korea, used widespread testing early in the pandemic to contain the virus and keep case numbers low. You need low case numbers to track and quarantine everyone infected, and UK numbers are currently too high. But vaccination should drive case numbers down to where containment becomes practicable. “We need to all become South Korea as quickly as possible,” says Joshua Gans of the University of Toronto, author of Economics in the Age of Covid-19. Lockdown does economic damage, but he insists there is no trade-off between that and deaths. “There is no point where we can keep the economy humming while people are getting sick in large numbers.” The faster we stop that, the less expensive it will be – and testing can both help contain the virus and allow us to do things like resume work.
“Rapid testing should have been brought in months ago,” agrees epidemiologist Tim Sly of Ryerson University in Toronto. “Anyone who deals with the public, from medical staff to taxi drivers, could be required to take a rapid test once a week,” and quarantined with financial support if the test is positive. The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests that we currently use are extremely accurate but slow. Rapid tests are less accurate but give almost instantaneous results. One kind (antigen) detects viral proteins, another (Lamp) detects viral RNA. The UK government plans to use all three kinds of tests to screen the half-million people of Liverpool, starting this weekend. The hope is to identify those infected, even without symptoms, and stop them spreading the virus. If it works, the plan is to deploy millions of the rapid tests before Christmas, in what was originally dubbed Operation Moonshot. Slovakia and Chinese cities including Wuhan have already demonstrated that it is possible to conduct such mass testing. It will have little impact on the spread of the virus, however, if those who test positive do not isolate themselves. The rate at which people who test positive isolate in England is as low as 20%.
For now, the plan is to use the tests to snuff out the spread of the virus and get numbers down to manageable levels. But eventually, disease experts envisage using them to enable a return of normal activities, despite the continued low-level circulation of the virus. There is a risk that with many tests, even a small false positive rate could disrupt too many lives needlessly. However, Sly says tests can be nested to improve accuracy. A test that is 90% sensitive will miss 10% of positives. “But two tests five to seven days apart are 99% sensitive at finding you positive – if you actually are.” This might enable us to begin carefree air travel again. Sly pictures taking a test when you buy the ticket a week before you fly. Then you get tested at the airport, a procedure not much more difficult than some now demanded in airport security. If both are negative, he says, “you board the plane and relax, because you know everyone else has been tested twice in the past week”. That means no catching Covid on the plane, and no quarantine at your destination. Airports in Italy, France and elsewhere are already using rapid tests to detect Covid in arriving passengers. Another sign of a return to normality would be to hug Gran without fear. Well, Gran will be vaccinated, but that might not mean she is 100% protected. And we might be unknowingly carrying the virus even if we are also vaccinated. Gran might even be carrying it. The chances are lower, but still there. Again, the key is testing.
The sensitivity of rapid tests might be less than the slow lab tests used now, but rapid tests detect people who are actually transmitting the virus, says Michael Mina of Harvard University. He would like them used widely. “Frequent rapid antigen tests can help stop Covid-19 while we await vaccines,” he tweeted last week. “These will help society regain normalcy.” Including a trip to the pub. Indoor gatherings might not be maskless for the foreseeable future, and some spacing might remain advisable. But even that may not be needed with widespread, self-administered rapid antigen tests, which will enable us to check if we pose a risk. Gans argues that trusting people to be truthful about these is no riskier than trusting people to monitor their symptoms, as we do now. Others may look at some individuals’ attitudes to masks and distancing and be less convinced. Anthony Fauci told the BBC last week: “With a successful vaccine, and the continuation of some form of public health measures, as we progress through the months of 2021, getting towards the third and fourth quarter, we will see a considerable approach towards some form of normality.”
Meanwhile, what we are learning while fighting Covid, adds Johns Hopkins’s Adalja, “could make us much more resilient to the next pandemic threat we face.”. Disease experts don’t think Covid-19 is a one-off, or that it will be long before we see another pandemic. A flu pandemic is an ever-present threat, and other viruses in wild animals worry researchers. If nothing else, there are other coronaviruses in bats that could jump species, that could be more lethal than Covid-19, and different enough to present us with a whole new fight. It is a fight we will be far more ready for if we don’t forget the lessons we are learning now. If wearing masks a bit longer helps drive those lessons home, that may not be a bad thing. But humans are highly adaptable, and normality is a movable feast. This time next year you may be having dreams about having somehow, inexplicably, left home without a mask – and everyone is pointing and staring. You make sure you grab one as you do your daily home test for Covid and a few other viruses, and head out to meet Gran down the pub, to give her the sherry you brought her from Spain. • Debora MacKenzie is the author of Covid-19: The Pandemic That Never Should Have Never Happened, and How to Stop the Next One (Little, Brown £18.99).

1832,EU draft declaration sets out stricter rules on migrant integration,11/9/20,"Migrants to Europe must learn the language of their new home countries and encourage their children to integrate in the light of the recent Islamist terror attacks, EU governments plan to say in a declaration drafted by France, Austria and Germany. The contentious draft statement, due to be made by EU home affairs ministers on Friday, is being championed by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who was accused by Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, of religious persecution after his recent warning of the dangers of Islamist separatism. It will also say Brussels should fund religious education within Muslim communities, and NGOs publishing “content hostile to integration will be excluded from receiving” state support under the terms of the resolution. There is some unease among fellow EU governments about the framing of the current draft, however. Sweden, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, among others, have traditionally pushed back against those who have viewed migration and religion through the prism of security. “Singling out a religion or group is never the answer to violent extremism by individuals,” said one senior EU diplomat. “We should do well to remember that embracing fundamental values isn’t just a responsibility of migrants or the Muslim community but for all us. We should be careful not to bring down our accomplishments by other people’s sins.” Should the statement be pulled before Friday, EU diplomats believe Macron will seek to push it again at a meeting of the bloc’s 27 heads of state and government in two weeks time. In a letter to the Financial Times in which Macron complained about an article criticising his approach – now withdrawn from the newspaper’s website – the president wrote that he would “not allow anybody to claim that France, or its government, is fostering racism against Muslims”. The current draft ministerial declaration says that the recent terrorist atrocities in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, Nice and Vienna have revealed the “extent of the threat we face from Islamist terrorism”. Alongside a series of technical counter-terrorism proposals, including the creation of backdoor access to encrypted communications used in chat apps, the statement proposes a tougher line on the need for migrants to integrate. “Successful integration of immigrants with a sense of belonging and equality is of central importance for the social cohesion of our modern pluralist, and open societies,” the draft says. “Integration is a two-way street: providing support but expecting more in return (fordern und fördern) is a core principle in this. This means that migrants are expected to make an active effort to become integrated while they are offered help with integration through government integration measures. “Along with recognition of European values, what successful integration means above all is learning the language of one’s new country, earning a living for oneself and for one’s family, and supporting the integration of one’s children … “It needs to be possible to sanction sustained refusal to integrate more strongly than has been the case to date. Organisations that support content hostile to integration will be excluded from receiving public funding.” The declaration further suggests that the European commission should fund religious education and training among imams. “We want to strengthen European Muslims as our partners in the fight against Islamist extremism for they too are its victims,” it says. “We want to support them in their efforts to organise their religion independently of foreign interference. In our view it is necessary to develop a shared language at European level which distinguishes between Islam and Islamism in the sense of religiously motivate extremism.” Charles Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium who is now president of the European Council, tweeted: “To fight the Ideology of Hatred, we need to setup as soon as possible a European Institute to train imams in Europe. “Online messages glorifying terrorism must be quickly removed. There must be no impunity for terrorists and those praising them on internet.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1833,Global report: new Covid lockdown in Hungary as Belgium passes second peak,11/9/20,"Hungary and Portugal have become the latest countries in Europe to impose tough new restrictions to stem the second wave of the coronavirus, as the first signs of light at the end of the tunnel emerged in France, Germany and Belgium. As the US pharmaceuticals company Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech, said their experimental Covid-19 vaccine appeared safe and more than 90% effective, Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, announced a partial lockdown. The restrictions, due to start on Wednesday and last 30 days, include an extension of an existing night-time curfew, a ban on gatherings, the closure of bars, restaurants and cultural venues and a move to online teaching for universities. Hungary recorded 5,000 new infections on Monday, the fourth-highest per capita rate in the EU, with more than 6,000 Covid-19 patients in hospital. Nearly 450 people were on ventilators. Portugal imposed a state of emergency and ordered about 70% of its population to stay home on weekday nights from 11pm to 5am for the next two weeks – and to only leave the house at the weekend in the mornings until 1pm, unless to buy essentials. As the number of cases worldwide passed 50 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, a leading expert in Italy – where more than 41,000 people have died – said the situation there was becoming unmanageable.
The government last week imposed a countrywide night curfew as well as tougher measures in four regions, closing most shops, bars and restaurants and restricting residents’ movements. “I am afraid there is no doubt that the situation is largely out of control,” Massimo Galli, the head of the infectious diseases department at Milan’s renowned Sacco hospital, said, backing call by the national federation of medical associations for a “total lockdown throughout the country”. Russia registered a record number of new infections on Monday, with cases in Moscow surpassing a previous high set in May, but the Kremlin has so far ruled out reimposing sweeping restrictions that were lifted earlier this year. An official tally showed new infections hit 21,798, nearly doubling the country’s first-wave record. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the steady growth in cases “remained alarming” but noted that “not all countries are in lockdown”. Elsewhere, there were glimmers of hope. Belgian authorities said they were confident the second wave of coronavirus hospital admissions had peaked, with about 400 people admitted to hospital on Sunday, compared with 879 on 3 November. “Subject to an unpleasant surprise,” the peak in hospital admissions had been reached, the virologist Yves Van Laethem said, while daily new infections were also down by about 40% against the average of the previous seven days. Belgium, which for part of last month had the highest number of daily cases per capita in Europe, returned to partial lockdown, closing non-essential shops, bars and restaurants and extending its schools’ half-term holidays. Infections in the Czech Republic, which has had one of Europe’s highest infection rates in recent weeks, have also started to decline after a two-month rise to record levels, with the country reporting 3,600 new cases from Sunday, the lowest daily tally in four weeks and 3,000 fewer than a week ago. There are initial signs that the rise of infections in Germany is also flattening, the health minister, Jens Spahn, said on Monday, although he added it would only become clear later this week whether restrictions that came into effect last week were working. “We are seeing that the dynamic is levelling off, that the increase is not as strong, but of course that is not the goal,” Spahn said. “We have to reduce the numbers.” In France, which last week reimposed a nationwide lockdown while keeping schools and essential businesses open, the health minister, Olivier Véran, said there were early indications the measures may be starting to slow the latest surge. Infection numbers would have flared up “faster and stronger” without them, Véran said, while Martin Hirsch, the director of the Paris regional health system’s 39 hospitals, said there had been “the beginnings of a dip” in admissions, which had slipped over the past few days to about 80 a day from 110 the previous week. The situation in French hospitals remained grim, with emergency wards approaching capacity and some sick patients being evacuated from struggling hospitals to others that still had space. The director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Ghebreyesus, said countries had to unite to fight the virus. “We might be tired of Covid-19, but it’s not tired of us,” he said. “It preys on inequality, division, denial, wishful thinking and wilful ignorance. We cannot close our eyes and hope it goes away. It pays no heed to political rhetoric or conspiracy theories. Our only hope is science, solutions and solidarity.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1834,Hunger fears in north-east Nigeria as roaming elephants trample crops,11/9/20,"A herd of hundreds of elephants that have returned to north-east Nigeria are under threat from jihadist groups and increasingly in conflict with thousands of refugees whose crops they have trampled weeks before harvest. More than 250 elephants ventured last month from Chad and Cameroon into Kala-Balge, a district in Nigeria’s Borno state. The presence of numerous village populations in Borno had for years deterred the elephants, who are usually wary of human settlements. But more than a decade of Boko Haram’s Islamist insurgency in north-east Nigeria has forced many villagers in Kala-Balge and across the region to flee to refugee camps or urban centres, leaving much of the rural expanse emptied and more appealing to the elephants. A population of about 8,000 internally displaced people remains in Kala-Balge, mostly residing in camps, and there are growing concerns over hunger. Babagana Shettima, a community leader in Kala-Balge, said the presence of the elephants has compounded misery in the district. “The situation of the elephants here is very terrible, they are really destroying our farmlands,” he said. “People here are already suffering, they are living in the camps or in the bush, they have to farm to eat and this is the only source for their food. If the elephants destroy it, they will not have any food to eat.” He said residents and refugees in Kala-Balge had resorted to walking 12 miles to the Cameroonian border to buy food. “Last month we received some food aid from the government but he had to come by helicopter because the roads are completely cut off.” The elephants in north-east Nigeria make up one of the last great herds in west Africa. Their first sighting in the region since the Boko Haram insurgency began was in December last year. “It is a very dangerous area for the elephants because of issues with the local populations and because there is still fighting,” said Peter Ayuba, the director of forests and wildlife in Borno state. “The elephants shouldn’t ordinarily be in Kala-Balge but the main issue is the conflict. The people need a place to live and farm their crops and the elephants also need peaceful areas to travel. The insecurity has affected their migratory routes because before there were many settlements of people but everywhere is now open.” Before the herd arrived in October, Nigeria was estimated to have an elephant population of only about 300, scattered in small groups across the country and highly vulnerable to poaching for their ivory. Dolmia Malachie, a conservationist with the Elephant Protection Initiative, said work to protect the animals had been hampered by insecurity across west Africa. “Last year we put a radio collar on one of these elephants in Chad, we tracked the movements and migratory patterns. Sadly, the animal was killed earlier this year in Nigeria,” he said. “We need the governments of the Lake Chad area to work together to secure the survival of these elephants.” Two national parks in Cameroon provided vital terrain for the animals, but the jihadist insurgency in the Lake Chad area and conflict spreading across the Sahel has left the elephants exposed to greater threats. Taskforces set up to tackle poaching face threats to their safety when operating in the region. The Boko Haram insurgency in the Lake Chad area has forced 2 million people to flee their homes and caused tens of thousands of deaths.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1835,ICC Uighur genocide complaint backed by parliamentarians around world,11/9/20,"The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court has been urged by an international alliance of parliamentarians to accept a complaint alleging genocide by China against its Uighur Muslim minority. The complaint, backed by more than 60 parliamentarians from 16 countries, says the Chinese government may be committing crimes amounting to genocide and other crimes against humanity against the Uighur and other Turkic peoples. The People’s Republic of China is not a signatory to the ICC, but the claim says the court has previously ruled that crimes started on the territory of an ICC state party fall within its jurisdiction. This precedent was established in a case involving crimes against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar in 2019. The letter claims mass deportation of Uighurs has occurred in Tajikistan and Cambodia, both signatories to the ICC, into China. The claim, sent to the chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, is seen as an early test case of the human rights climate since Joe Bidenbecame president-elect. It has wide cross-party support in a number of countries, including from the former UK Conservative party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the Australian Labor senator Kimberley Kitching and Margarete Bause of the German Green party. The claim has been organised the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC). The letter states: “The ICC has a unique ability to adjudicate on alleged genocide and crimes against humanity internationally. We call on the ICC to play its part in ensuring that the perpetrators of the most egregious human rights abuses are held accountable and prevented from acting with impunity.” The Labour peer Helena Kennedy QC, the IPAC co-chair and director of the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute, said: “Mounting evidence points to the most horrific abuses against Uighurs and other minorities in the Xinjiang region. The international criminal court must fully examine the allegations brought before it and, if warranted, make every effort to ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice.” Rodney Dixon, the barrister leading on the detailed legalities of the claim, said: “The support for our complaint shown by the IPAC parliamentarians is very significant. The prosecutor should feel encouraged that so many parliamentarians from other ICC member states believe she should open an investigation into officials of the Chinese government for the atrocities being committed against the Uighur and other Turkic people. “For too long, nothing of substance has been done to bring justice to those who are suffering on a daily basis at the hands of the Chinese government. This is a breakthrough and momentous opportunity which we urge the ICC prosecutor to pursue without delay. This chance should not be squandered.” The case is an early test for the ICC in the new international human rights climate established by Donald Trump’s defeat. Trump imposed sanctions on the ICC’s chief prosecutor and another senior official in response to the court’s investigation of US actions in Afghanistan as well consideration of Israeli actions in Palestine. The ICC found there was a preliminary case to hear concerning allegations that US troops had committed torture at secret detention sites in Afghanistan. Biden’s advisers opposed the US sanctions on ICC staff, however it is likely he would continue to oppose ICC investigations into US citizens. William Barr, the outgoing US attorney general, said the US government had reason to doubt the honesty of the ICC and described it as “little more than a political tool employed by unaccountable international elites”.
Created by a UN treaty in 2002, the ICC investigates and brings to justice those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, intervening when national authorities cannot or will not prosecute.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1836,"Italy faces 10,000 Covid deaths in a month with no lockdown â€“ medics",11/9/20,"Doctors in Italy have warned there will be an additional 10,000 Covid-19 deaths in a month in the country unless a national lockdown is imposed. The government is moving toward placing further restrictions in four more regions considered high risk: Campania, Liguria, Abruzzo and Umbria. The Italian Order of Doctors, however, has urged tougher action as hospitals struggle to find space for coronavirus patients. Ambulances have been queuing outside emergency units from Turin in the north to Naples in the south. People were treated for Covid-19 in their cars outside Cotugno hospital in Naples, the capital of Campania, over the weekend. One 78-year-old woman waited in an ambulance for 26 hours before being admitted to hospital. As Italy edges towards a million coronavirus infections since the start of the pandemic, 32,616 new cases were registered on Sunday, a more than sevenfold increase since 8 October. There were 331 Covid-related fatalities, bringing the total to 41,394, the highest in mainland Europe.
More than 26,000 people are being treated in hospital for Covid-19, of whom 2,749 are in intensive care, up from 1,939 on 1 November. “Considering last week’s data as a typical trend … the situation in a month will be dramatic and therefore we must immediately resort to a total closure,” said Filippo Anelli, the president of the Italian Order of Doctors.
Giuseppe Conte’s government introduced a controversial tier system last week, which placed Italy’s 20 regions in either a yellow, orange or red zone depending on their levels of risk. Alto Adige joined Lombardy, Piedmont, Aosta Valley and Calabria in the red zone on Monday, meaning people can only leave their homes for work, health or emergency purposes. Puglia and Sicily are in the orange zone and the rest of the country is in the yellow zone. “Either we stop the virus or it will stop us because the signs are such that the system will not hold up,” Anelli said. “Even regions currently in the yellow zone will soon find themselves in the same situation as the worst-affected areas. With the current average, in a month we could reach a further 10,000 deaths.” The government has so far resisted a new national lockdown as it strives to regain control of the pandemic while lessening the impact on the economy. The regional measures have created divisions between local governors and central government, however, with some regions accused of manipulating data to avoid being upgraded to a higher risk zone.
Lombardy continues to be the hardest-hit area, followed by Campania and Piedmont. Authorities in Piedmont have called on the help of medics working for NGOs as regional hospitals struggle with shortages. Staff at a hospital in the Lombardy province of Monza have asked for medical support from abroad. More than 16,000 health workers have been infected with Covid-19 in the last 30 days, according to figures from Italy’s higher health institute, and 186 medics have died since the start of the pandemic. Walter Ricciardi, the chief scientist advising the health minister, told La Stampa that the tiered system was the final attempt to bring down infections before the government was forced to impose a national lockdown. The average age of infection in Italy is currently 44, and the average age of death 80. As of 4 November, 434 of the 39,052 deaths recorded were among people under 50, according to the higher health institute. Of that number, 95 were under 40, of whom 64 had serious secondary illnesses. Fourteen did not have other conditions, and no clinical information was available for 17.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1837,Japan's 'Jo Baiden' becomes overnight internet sensation,11/9/20,"Joe Biden’s election victory has brought an improbable moment of celebrity to a local politician in Japan. Yutaka Umeda, 73, the mayor of Yamato, a small town in the south-west of the country, has become an overnight internet sensation after it was noticed that the kanji characters used to write his name can also be pronounced “Jo Baiden”. He reportedly had no idea that people had made the connection between his and Biden’s name until his family told him he was trending on social media. “I feel very close to him”, a “perplexed” Umeda said, according to the Kyodo news agency. “It feels as though I’ve also won the election.” Kanji characters, which originated in China, often have several phonetic readings. The mayor’s surname 梅田 – comprising two characters meaning “plum” and “field” – can be read as “ume” and “da”, but also as “bai” – pronounced “buy” – and “den”. The single character 穣 for his given name, Yutaka, is more commonly pronounced as “jo”. Umeda said he hoped his association with the US president-elect would bring his town, with a population of about 15,000, the same recognition the Japanese fishing town of Obama enjoyed when its namesake became a presidential candidate. Residents formed an “Obama for Obama” support group while he was still aiming to become the Democratic nominee in 2008, and watched the Super Tuesday results live at a hotel adorned with a large portrait of the candidate. The town later created themed chopsticks, sweet-bean buns and other souvenirs featuring his name and image. Barack Obama name-checked the town during a visit to Japan in 2009. “I could not come here without sending my greetings and gratitude to the citizens of Obama, Japan,” he said. Umeda said he had received tongue-in-cheek messages congratulating him on Biden’s election. “Although there is a huge difference between the job of the US president and mine, as the mayor of Yamato … our passion is the same,” he said. Japan’s prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, was among the first world leaders to congratulate the “other” Joe Biden. “Warm congratulations to @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris,” he tweeted on Sunday morning Japan time. “I look forward to working with you to further strengthen the Japan-U.S. Alliance and ensure peace, freedom and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1838,New restrictions announced in US states seeing Covid-19 surges,11/9/20,"As America grapples with record-breaking surges in Covid-19 infections and no meaningful federal response, some state and local governments are implementing new restrictions to combat the surging virus. Other hard-hit areas, however, are taking little to no action against a pandemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives and sent the US economy into a tailspin. Oregon, which saw a state record-breaking 805 new cases on Thursday and 769 on Friday, will implement new restrictions in at least five counties to stop Covid-19 from spreading. These regulations halt visits to care homes, and limit indoor dining at restaurants to 50 people, according to the Associated Press.
Authorities are also urging businesses to require work-from-home. Officials are also asking Oregon residents not to gather with people they don’t live with, but to limit any non-household gathering to six people, the AP reported. In New York, Andrew Cuomo, the governor, said on Friday that officials were weighing additional restrictions to combat the surge in western and central New York and would announce details on Monday. Cuomo also said that officials would ramp up enforcement of new quarantine requirements for out-of-state travelers. Those coming to New York from states other than New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts must take a Covid-19 test within three days of arriving, show proof that it is negative, and then have another negative test the fourth day after arrival. “We’re going to be increasing enforcement personnel at the New York airports. You should not land if you do not have proof of a negative test upon landing,” Cuomo said. “I’m increasing the national guard. I spoke to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio about increasing the New York police department at the airports, but I want people to know we’re serious.” New Jersey is poised to see new restrictions after Covid-19 hospitalizations tripled over the last seven weeks, governor Phil Murphy said on Thursday. The state’s daily case data is also nearing the levels seen in early May. Connecticut has also limited some reopening initiatives due to a recent spike in cases, NBC New York reported. Elsewhere, the response was not as aggressive despite the virus now raging through vast swaths of America, and especially the midwest and Great Plains states. On Friday, health authorities in Kansas reported 5,418 new coronavirus cases over two days. A top health authority said that people are ignoring masks and social distancing initiatives indoors and at public events – and claimed many local officials “haven’t done anything” to stop the spread, AP said. North Dakota and South Dakota, which do not have full or partial mask requirements, are seeing soaring rates. In Wisconsin, which is also seeing rising case numbers, Governor Tony Evers’s health emergency order was made “virtually irrelevant” because of legal challenges, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Although Iowa is seeing record Covid-19 infection and hospitalization rates, the Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, has not announced any new actions to stop the disease from spreading. She urged Iowa residents to “do their part” and said authorities would launch an awareness campaign promoting hygiene and social distancing, the Des Moines Register reported. This patchwork approach has boded poorly for countrywide disease rates. The US broke its record for the highest number of Covid-19 cases in a single day on Friday, with 128,000 additional new infections, according to the Washington Post. Deaths were over 1,000 for the fourth day in a row. About 53,000 people were hospitalized because of coronavirus on Thursday. In total, the US has marked more than 9.7m Covid-19 cases and 235,000 deaths since the pandemic started – more than any other country, according to Johns Hopkins University data.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1839,New Zealand to send team to investigate Cook Islands travel bubble,11/9/20,"New Zealand is inching closer towards establishing its first travel bubble, with the prime minister announcing a reconnaissance team will be heading to the Cook Islands on Saturday. If the trip goes smoothly a travel bubble could be established within a fortnight, the PM said. The news came as Jacinda Ardern held her first post-cabinet press conference since being re-elected in a landslide victory in the general election in October. The Cook Islands has been declared Covid-19 free, and has been pleading for a travel bubble for months, saying its economy is being decimated by the complete lack of tourism – the main driver of its small economy. “The hard truth is that if this drags on much longer, we’ll be coming to you for help one way or the other,” said Fletcher Melvin, the chair of the Cook Islands private sector taskforce in July, addressing the New Zealand government. “Our community wants a hand, not a handout – we’d much rather have New Zealand tourism dollars than its aid money.”
New Zealand has been pursuing a Covid-elimination strategy and has been reluctant to open its borders to anyone, including the Pacific Islands, after shutting them in mid-March. Governments across the Pacific also hold concerns that if the virus were to gain a significant foothold in the region it could devastate island communities, which have limited public health infrastructure, and populations with high rates of comorbidities such as diabetes.
Meanwhile, Ardern again seemed to splash cold water ona travel bubble with Australia in the near future, saying her government had concerns about how the threshold of community transmission in Australia. The prime minister said it was her understanding that a community spread alert was not raised in Australia until 10 or more cases had appeared for three consecutive days – a threshold that seemed “very high” to New Zealand. “We have an elimination strategy and something like 10 cases a day would be indicative of a much wider problem,” Ardern said. “So that’s what we have to be concerned with.” The prime minister said she last spoke to her Australian counterpart Scott Morrison ten days ago, following her election win, and was seeking clarity on a number of points before the trans-Tasman bubble progressed at all. Currently, Australia allows New Zealanders to enter a number of its states, but the arrangement is not reciprocal, and all New Zealanders who choose to visit Australia must enter managed isolation for two weeks on arrival back in New Zealand. New Zealand’s borders remain closed to all nationalities, including Australian citizens",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1840,Pacific nations herald Biden presidency amid hope for action on climate emergency,11/9/20,"Joe Biden’s presidential ascension had not even been settled when Fiji’s forthright prime minister was already urging greater US action on climate change from the incoming American leader. “Congratulations Joe Biden,” Frank Bainimarama tweeted on Saturday afternoon. “Together, we have a planet to save from a climate emergency and a global economy to build back better from Covid-19.”
Bainimarama said the whole world, but particularly the imperilled Paific, would look to the US for global leadership in addressing the climate crisis. “Now, more than ever we need the USA at the helm of these multilateral efforts - and back in the Paris Agreement as soon as possible!” Bainimarama has even invited the US president-elect to attend the annual Pacific Islands Forum leaders’ meeting in Suva – “to the frontlines of climate change” - in August next year. If Biden accepts, he will be the first US president ever to attend the Pacific’s major multilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton having attended as secretary of state in 2012.
Biden has already committed the US to re-joining the Paris Climate Accord on the first day of his presidency, and to convening a global climate summit within his first 100 days in office. He has a strong personal connection with the Pacific region, and with Papua New Guinea in particular. Born at the height of the second world war, Biden has said his young life was shaped by stories of his family’s service in the Pacific theatre. Four uncles on his mother’s side sought to enrol in the military the day after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour drew the US into the war. “Papua New Guinea, that’s where my two uncles ended up, in the Army Air Corps of the United States Army,” Biden said in a speech in 2017. “My mother’s number two brother, Ambrose Finnegan … was shot down, and his body was never found, in Papua New Guinea. “And the other came home with malaria and was sick, off and on, for the better part of his life.” After the election was called on Sunday morning, other Pacific leaders joined the global chorus of congratulations. Action on climate change, and the selection of Senator Kamala Harris – the first woman of colour elected vice-president – on the presidential ticket, were consistent themes. Papua New Guinea’s prime minister, James Marape, said the US election “captivated the whole world … with our people glued to their TV screens”. The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said her country would work alongside the US to secure the “prosperity, security, and sustainability in the Indo-Pacific and Pacific Island regions”. “The campaign by the president-elect has also shown the shared interests we have in addressing global challenges like Covid-19 and climate change.”
Niuean Dr Colin Tukuitonga, the former director-general of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, said Biden’s election, and commitment to the Paris Agreement was “great news for the planet and my beloved Pacific Islands”. The Cook Islands prime minister, Mark Brown, praised Biden’s choice of Harris as his running mate, describing it as “aspirational”. Leaders from US territories in the Pacific also welcomed a new commander-in-chief. Guam, whose residents are US citizens but not entitled to vote, supported Biden in an informal straw poll taken alongside local elections last Tuesday. “I look forward to working with your administration for the good of our people, our island, our culture, and our national security in this part of the Pacific world,” Guam Governor, Lou Leon Guerrero, said. “Let us choose unity over division, love over hate, and healing over bitterness.” Gregorio Sablan, the non-voting delegate to the US house of representatives from the US Pacific territory of the Northern Mariana Islands, said he would work “to advance the Biden-Harris agenda of controlling the pandemic, reviving the economy, continuing the fight against poverty, moving forward on racial justice …, and addressing the threat of climate change”. The editorial board of the Samoa Observer wrote: “Mr Biden is a world away from President Trump on the issue of climate change ... there are reasons for Samoa – and the Pacific – to be optimistic.”
Joe Biden has promised significant commitment to the Pacific, particularly in the face of growing Chinese influence across the region. Vice-president under Obama’s “pivot” to the Asia-Pacific, Biden has consistently argued the US “is a Pacific country” and will remain a power in the region “as long as we exist”. “In the Asia Pacific in the 21st century, the United States of America is ‘all in’,” he said in Sydney in 2016. “Anyone who questions America’s dedication and staying power in the Asia-Pacific simply is not paying attention.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1841,PM channels his inner John Wayne in vaccine metaphor meltdown | John Crace,11/9/20,"Shortly before 5pm in the UK, president-elect Joe Biden gave a press conference. The results of the trials were very promising, he said, but there was still a long way to go before a vaccination programme could be rolled out nationwide. So it was now more important than ever not to let your guard down and to carry on wearing masks. It was coherent, informative and in less than five minutes Biden had told Americans just about everything they needed to know. Boris Johnson likes to do things rather differently. Almost to the second after Biden had finished speaking, the prime minister stepped out into the Downing Street briefing room, flanked by the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, and Brigadier Joe Fossey, dressed in full camo gear that had the reverse effect of drawing attention to himself. A new form of anti-camo perhaps. After a few introductions, Boris went on one of his long rambles. He didn’t really have anything to say that couldn’t have been wrapped up in minutes but he considers a press conference not to have taken place unless he’s wasted the best part of an hour of everyone’s time. Perhaps it was the excitement of having a real life soldier standing next to him, but Johnson’s explanation of the new vaccination was relayed in a series of metaphors straight out of the movie Stagecoach. The arrows were in the quiver! The cavalry was on its way, the toot of the bugle – Michael Gove’s presumably – was getting louder but still some way off. Having a prime minister who manages to trivialise something really important is getting extremely draining and it’s hard not to zone out within moments of him starting a sentence. So much for the great communicator. Next up was the brigadier who is in charge of the mass testing in Liverpool and looked uncomfortable throughout. “Two thousand troops have answered the call,” he said, making it sound as if the soldiers had had some say in their deployment rather than been told they were off to Liverpool for the next four weeks. He then pulled out a piece of plastic from his pocket. “You know what a swab is,” he continued. “Well this is the lateral flow that gives you a result within an hour.” And that was all he had to say. He didn’t seem at all sure what the lateral flow actually was or how it worked but then he was only following orders. If he’d had his way, he’d have saved the taxpayer a return train ticket from Liverpool to London. There was no slideshow this time – obviously No 10 has started to wonder if they are more trouble than they are worth after recent events – so Van-Tam was left to ad lib on the vaccine trial. Even though he had no more information than Boris, so all he could do was repeat the fact that it was exciting but we shouldn’t get carried away just yet. Try to think of it as a penalty shootout, he said – Boris’s crap analogies are as contagious as the coronavirus. We’ve scored the first goal, so we know the keeper can be beaten, but there was a long way to go before the match was won. No one seemed to have told Van-Tam that the expectation in a shootout was that the penalty-taker would score. Things carried on in much the same vein when questions came in from the media. The brigadier tried to make himself as inconspicuous as possible – merging into the background was part of his SAS training – and so the only other thing he had to offer was that he was just on day four of his deployment so it was hard to tell whether things were going well or badly. Van-Tam desperately hunted around for new ways of saying the vaccination trials were still at an early stage, but things were looking more hopeful for next year. Try to think of yourself as being on a railway station on a wet and windy night, he said, doing his best to channel his inner Fat Controller. You could see the lights of the train two miles away. Then the train pulled into the station and you didn’t know if the door was going to open. Next you couldn’t even be sure of whether there would be enough seats for everyone. The UK had only ordered enough vaccine for about a third of the population, so unless more doses came online most people were going to miss out. It didn’t sound quite as hopeful as he had suggested. But maybe that’s just the way he tells them. Boris, meanwhile, just looked relieved to only get one question on the US presidential election. And that wasn’t even on if he had spoken to the president-elect – he hadn’t as Biden has been too busy taking calls from Micronesia – or if he had any reaction to being called a “shape-shifting creep” by a former adviser to Barack Obama. The Democrats still haven’t forgiven Boris for his remarks about Obama’s part-Kenyan ancestry giving him a dislike of the British empire. “I congratulate the president-elect,” said Johnson, sidestepping a suggestion he give Donald Trump a call to persuade him to throw in the towel. The US and the UK had had a close relationship in the past and no doubt would do so in the future. He had nothing to say on Brexit. Rather he chose to accentuate the shared climate change objectives of Cop27. Or Cop26 as the rest of the world knows it.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1842,Two dead as Russian military helicopter shot down in Armenia,11/9/20,"A Russian military helicopter has been shot down over Armenia, threatening to draw Moscow further into an escalating conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan that has left thousands dead. The Russian Mi-24 military helicopter was shot down on Monday by a surface-to-air missile while escorting a convoy from a Russian military base in the country. Two Russian servicemen were killed in the attack, Moscow said, and another was injured. The Russian defence ministry said it was investigating who was behind the attack. Later on Monday evening, Azerbaijan’s foreign ministry took responsibility for the attack on the Russian helicopter and apologised, saying that Baku was willing to pay compensation.
Armenia’s emergency ministry reported that the crash took place near the village of Yeraskh, which is in southern Armenia near the border with Azerbaijan. That is far from the fighting in the contested region of Nagorno-Karabakh, where Azerbaijan has launched a bloody offensive to retake the mountain enclave from de facto Armenian control. The attack appeared to come from across the border in the Azerbaijani-held Nakhchivan region. The attack will test Russia’s willingness to stay on the sidelines of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, both ex-Soviet nations with which Russia maintains good relations and arms contracts. Azerbaijan is backed by Turkey, a regional rival which Moscow has both courted and countered by backing rival sides in Syria. Moscow has said it will honour a commitment to defend Armenia under a military treaty if fighting spills beyond Nagorno-Karabakh, which is internationally recognised as Azerbaijani territory but has been controlled by an Armenian-backed administration since 1994. But Moscow has largely stood by as Azerbaijan’s forces have moved through the mountain enclave, claiming to capture the mountaintop town of Shusha and approaching the region’s largest city of Stepanakert. A Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman played down the likelihood of military intervention, urging both sides to end hostilities but said that Moscow “does not support a forcible settlement of this crisis.” Azerbaijan on Monday released its first evidence that it had taken the city of Shusha (called Shushi in Armenian), including a short video showing Azerbaijani troops raising a flag over the city administration. An official in the Nagorno-Karabakh administration confirmed it had lost control over Shusha on Monday and warned that an Azerbaijani offensive was close to Stepanakert. “Shushi is entirely outside of our control,” Vahram Poghosyan, the spokesman for the Nagorno-Karabakh administration, wrote on Facebook on Monday. Poghosyan did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but he did confirm his remarks to Reuters and local Armenian media. However, other local and Armenian officials denied that Shusha had been taken. In a statement on Monday evening, the prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, said that the “battle for the city of Shushi is continuing.” “The [Nagorno Karabakh] defense army and militia are firmly standing on their native soil, and we will continue fighting against the enemy till the end,” he said.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1843,UAE decriminalises alcohol and lifts ban on unmarried couples living together,11/9/20,"The United Arab Emirates has ended lenient punishments for so-called “honour” killings, lifted a ban on unmarried couples living together and decriminalised alcohol, in reforms to personal laws. Foreigners living in the Gulf state will also be able to follow their home country’s laws on divorce and inheritance, rather than using UAE legislation based on Islamic religious law, government-linked media reported. The country, where citizens are outnumbered nine-to-one by migrants, has long branded itself internationally as a modern business and tourist destination and has not always strictly implemented its own law.
When it has, however, reporting on those cases has shadowed its reputation abroad. Such cases have included that of a woman who was jailed after reporting her rape. The legal reforms aim to “consolidate the UAE’s principles of tolerance,” state-run WAM news agency reported, as it adapts to changing norms at home and prepares to host the World Expo next year. The gathering, delayed for a year by coronavirus, is expected to draw 25 million visitors. “I could not be happier for these new laws that are progressive and proactive,” Emirati filmmaker Abdallah Al Kaabi, whose art has tackled taboo topics such as homosexual love and gender identity, told the Associated Press. “2020 has been a tough and transformative year for the UAE,” he added. Emirati judges have until now been allowed to hand down lighter sentences when a woman was attacked or killed by a relative because she has acted in a way he considers to have affected the family reputation, or “honour”. That can include eloping or fraternising with men not related to them. Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, described the changes as “positive steps for women’s rights” but also raised concerns about the daughters of Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.
A UK family court this year found he had orchestrated the abductions of two of his children – one from the streets of Cambridge – and subjected his youngest wife to a campaign of “intimidation”. The new laws will also include tougher punishments for men who subject women to harassment of any kind, the National newspaper reported. The reports did not mention other behaviour outlawed by Emirati law, which has previously landed foreigners in trouble, including homosexual relationships, cross-dressing and public displays of affection. Although alcohol is available for sale in restaurants and bars in Emirati cities, individuals needed a licence to buy booze or keep it in their homes. The new laws would apparently allow Muslims, who have not been able to get licences, to drink alcoholic beverages freely.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1844,UK government fails to publish details of £4bn Covid contracts with private firms,11/9/20,"The government has failed to publish any information about £4bn of Covid-related contracts awarded to private companies, in what appears to be a continuing breach of UK law. The gap was uncovered by campaign group the Good Law Project, which along with a cross-party group of MPs, is suing the health secretary, Matt Hancock, in the high court. They are accusing his ministry of an “egregious and widespread failure to comply with legal duties and established policies”. The group is warning of a “transparency gap” and is pushing for an independent judge-led inquiry into the billions spent on personal protective equipment, medicines and virus testing and tracing since the pandemic began. In a legal filing in the case, dated 30 October, government lawyers revealed that £17bn had been spent by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on Covid-related goods and services since the start of the financial year in April. However, to date civil servants in Hancock’s ministry have only released details of £12.4bn in Covid-related contracts for that period – leaving £4.6bn unaccounted for. The gap narrowed last week after the department rushed out details of £1.6bn in contracts. Many of the new deals are for the purchase of rapid test kits of the kind being used in Liverpool’s city-wide testing effort. Government departments are required by law to publish details of contracts no later than 30 days after awarding them. The measures are designed to reduce the risk of fraud and improve value for money by allowing proper scrutiny of how taxpayer cash is spent. Notices alerting the public to awards over a certain value by publicly funded bodies appear on a European database, Tenders Electronic Daily, and on the UK’s own Contracts Finder website. Meanwhile, government guidance advises civil servants to publish the contracts themselves within 20 days. “There is overwhelming evidence that entities connected to key government figures have made staggering fortunes from these procurement contracts,” said Jolyon Maugham, founder of the Good Law Project. “There is a clear public interest in us knowing promptly, whilst those contracts can still be challenged, who benefited and to the tune of how much.” Among last week’s notices is the largest Covid-related purchase so far by DHSC. The ministry has signed a £496m deal with Innova Medical, which is supplying lateral flow kits. The devices look and work like pregnancy tests, and are made in China for Innova. An earlier contract with Innova cost the taxpayer £107m. The California-based company is owned by the private equity group Pasaca Capital, which was founded by a Chinese investment banker in 2017. Whether the deals are value for money remains in question. It is not yet known whether the tests can detect the virus in pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic people, and the government has not published its data on trials of the kits. Good Law’s claim singles out a number of cases, including the award of a £252m PPE contract to a company called Ayanda Capital on 29 April. Notice of the award was not published on the European database until 2 July. The contract itself was not published until 4 September. Ayanda, which describes itself as specialising in currency trading and offshore property, secured the deal with the help of an associate who was previously an adviser to the government. The legal challenge also names Pestfix, a pest control business, which has signed 11 PPE contracts with the government. So far, only six have been published. Government lawyers have defended the delays, admitting “technical breaches” of the law, but saying the information will be made public “in due course”. They say any legal action risks delaying publication. The DHSC said it could not comment on legal proceedings, adding: “As part of an unprecedented response to this global pandemic we have drawn on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners. This is completely in line with procurement regulations for exceptional circumstances. “We have been clear from the outset that public authorities must achieve value for taxpayers and use good commercial judgement. Publication of contract information is being carried out as quickly as possible in line with government transparency guidelines.” Spending watchdog the National Audit Office has prepared a report on government procurement during the pandemic. It is understood the report is with DHSC for factchecking and due to be released this month. “It’s astounding that there could be a gap this big between what the government spent and what it has told the public it paid,” said Labour’s shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves. “There has been a whole catalogue of contracts that are either opaque, wasteful, unaccountable, or linked to Tory friends and donors. It’s little wonder that trust in the government’s handling of public contracts is dropping like a stone.” The gap between the value of contracts awarded and the value of those published has been caused by delays in meeting the 30-day deadline. Research firm Tussell, which was commissioned by Good Law to monitor contract notices, said Covid-related awards are taking an average of 78 days to appear, compared with 41 days for non-Covid awards. “While the Department of Health has published £12.4bn of Covid-response contracts, we know this is still not the full picture of its spending to date,” said Tussell founder, Gus Tugendhat. “It may be that the lag in publishing is even greater than that reported here.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1845,UK rollout of Covid vaccine could start before Christmas,11/9/20,"Britain could start distributing a coronavirus vaccine by Christmas, the deputy chief medical officer has said as he and Boris Johnson hailed “a significant scientific breakthrough” – but cautioned the public of hurdles to come. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said news that large-scale trials showing the Pfizer/BioNTech candidate to be 90% effective was “very exciting” but warned that no vaccine would come soon enough to stop significant restrictions on public life during the second wave. “I’m hopeful … but not yet certain that we could begin to see some vaccine by Christmas,” he said. He said the progress was also significant for other vaccines in development. “Almost all of the vaccines coming also target the S protein,” he said.
“This is like getting to the end of a playoff final, it’s gone to penalties. The first player goes up, scores the goal. You haven’t won the cup yet, but what it does is it tells you that the goalkeeper can be beaten. And that’s where we are today that first sign.” Johnson said the vaccine was “very, very early days” but the UK would be ready to distribute it. “I have [talked] about the distant bugle of the scientific cavalry coming over the brow of the hill. I can tell you that tonight that the bugle is louder, but it’s still some way off. We absolutely cannot rely on this news as a solution.”
He said should the Pfizer vaccine pass all the vigorous safety checks, the UK had ordered 40 million doses for about a third of the population, since each person needs two doses, and “that puts us towards the front of the international pack on a per capita basis”. It remains unclear if the vaccine prevents people catching the virus and passing it on, or rather prevents someone developing symptoms. Van-Tam said older people would be first in line for the vaccination, with prioritisation decided by an independent committee. “Far and away age is the biggest priority for patients who most need the vaccines and need to get those vaccines first,” he said. “You can expect a theme of increasing age being the highest priority to be a theme that stays with us as we go on this journey.” However, Johnson warned that advice from Sage on Friday found the R number, showing reproduction, was still above one in England, though without taking into account the current national restrictions, and that deaths had doubled in 24 days. “We are heading towards the levels of the previous peak,” he said. “Neither mass testing nor progress on vaccine, though they’re both vital arrows in our epidemiological quiver … they are no substitute for the national restrictions.” Van-Tam said the result was “a swallow but very much not a summer” and people could expect restrictions on socialising to continue for some time.
He said he could not guarantee people would be able to hug their grandparents or kiss their dates by Easter but if vaccines were distributed they would make a “significant difference to the kind of disease levels we see in the UK at the moment”. “Once these vaccines begin to be deployed then over a period of time they will make a significant difference to the kind of disease level we see in the UK at moment,” he said. “Whether they reduce transmission is something we do not know yet and that is a crucial factor that will understand how far vaccines take us towards to the kind of future that you aspire to. We are working on that.” He added: “We don’t know what this means yet for when we can get life back to normal, when we can start to lift some of the restrictions that we live under. “Frankly, we’re in the middle of the second wave, and I don’t see the vaccine making any difference for the wave we are now in. I’m hopeful that it may prevent future waves, but this one we have to battle through to the end without vaccine.” Johnson said the next step was ramping up mass testing, hinting this could help students return home for Christmas.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1846,UK vaccine taskforce chief Kate Bingham expected to quit,11/9/20,"Kate Bingham, the beleaguered chair of the UK vaccine taskforce, is expected to leave her post at the end of the year, according to a government source. Bingham, a venture capitalist married to Treasury minister Jesse Norman, has come under fire for her use of expensive PR consultants and allegations over a presentation to a private investors’ conference. She is set to leave her post when her contract runs out in January 2021, with the source saying it “had always been clear” that was her intention. Labour had asked the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, to investigate claims that Bingham disclosed sensitive information about potential targets for the government’s vaccines push to a $200-a-head private conference. According to a video of the event obtained by the Sunday Times, Bingham showed financiers a detailed list of vaccines which the UK government was closely monitoring and could later invest in. Bingham reportedly told the event: “We haven’t necessarily signed contracts with all of them so far. But they’re all in our sights.” Several of the vaccines are owned or funded by publicly traded companies.
Appearing before a joint select committee hearing last week, Bingham denied any wrongdoing and described the report as “nonsense”, “inaccurate” and “irresponsible”. She insisted her presentation had relied “on publicly available information and said little that expert delegates at the conference could not deduce themselves”. Bingham, who reports directly to the prime minister, has spent more than £600,000 of taxpayers’ money on hiring PR consultants from a firm called Admiral Associates, rather than rely on civil service press officers, according to leaked documents also obtained by the Sunday Times. Speaking on Monday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told LBC Radio the £670,000 bill for spin doctors could not be justified. “You cannot justify that sort of money being spent,” he said. “If only it was the only example. There are lots of examples of lucrative contracts going without any due process and I think the public mood on this is very, very clear.” A Downing Street spokesman said the decision to hire the PR advisers was signed off by officials at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). “Specialist communications support was contracted by the vaccine taskforce for a time-limited period in line with existing public sector recruitment practices and frameworks,” the spokesman said. Asked whether the prime minister had full confidence in her, the spokesman said: “Yes. The work of the vaccine taskforce is obviously of great importance and we have secured agreements for 350m doses overall of six leading vaccine candidates.” The government has repeatedly been accused of cronyism in its management of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dido Harding, who was selected to run the £12bn NHS test-and-trace programme without an open appointments process, is married to Conservative MP John Penrose. Harding is not taking a salary for her role, and an advertisement for her permanent replacement is expected to be placed shortly. A BEIS spokesperson previously said: “As we have already made clear, Kate Bingham’s role as chair of the vaccine taskforce includes appearing at conferences, speaking to media and liaising closely with wider stakeholders.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1847,Wigan man fined for visiting friend for cup of tea in Covid breach,11/9/20,"A man has been fined by Greater Manchester police (GMP) for breaching coronavirus regulations by visiting a friend’s house for a cup of tea. The force said the man had been issued with a fixed penalty notice – which start at £200 for Covid breaches – after visiting the property in Lowton in the borough of Wigan on Friday night. Under the national lockdown in England, different households are not allowed to meet indoors unless they are part of an “exclusive” support bubble. Officers from the Golborne and Lowton neighbourhood team said the man, whose age was not given, had lied about why he was at his friend’s house. In a Facebook post, the team said: “As a follow on from yesterday’s post reminding you we are currently in Lockdown 2.0 as they say and under government restrictions, a fixed penalty was issued to a male last night who decided he was going to see his mate and have a brew with him.
“To make matters worse he tried to lie about why he was there. You cannot go to another person’s address unless for certain exemptions ie childcare, support bubble etc.” Five chief constables in the north-west of England , including from GMP, said in an open letter last week that people who ignored Covid-19 restrictions should be prepared to “face the consequences of greater levels of enforcement”. Under the lockdown, those who break Covid rules can be issued a fine starting at £200, reduced to £100 if it is paid within 14 days. The sum can rise to as much as £6,400 for repeat offenders. On Sunday, GMP arrested four people on suspicion of public order offences and issued 24 £200 FPNs at an anti-lockdown protest in Manchester city centre.",,Foreign,Guardian,5

1863,"Mass hoppers' giving us anxiety, say Irish priests",11/10/20,"Irish Catholic priests are being afflicted by performance anxiety during online masses because of bad reviews from “mass-hopping” worshippers. Parishioners are pressuring priests in Ireland to install webcams and to spice up their services to attract more viewers, according to the Association of Catholic Priests (ACP). Covid-19 restrictions have obliged churches to move services online, prompting some worshippers to rate priests as if they were television presenters, according to Fr Brendan Hoban, a co-founder of the group. “They’re hopping from mass to mass, just sampling them,” he said. “Priests are under huge pressure to perform. They are being marked out on their particular performances.” Parishioners were comparing viewing figures as if it were a competition, said Fr Hoban. “It’s an indication if their church is as good as the church down the road. ‘We have 47 hits, another has 2,000 hits – what’s wrong with you, father? Why do we have only 47 hits?’ “They would say the priest next door has A, B, C and D in terms of presentation skills.” The parishioner comments were made in person or over the phone, he said. Fr Tim Hazelwood, a spokesman for the ACP, drew attention to the issue in a Zoom address to the group’s annual general meeting on 28 October. Some priests had stopped doing online services because of a “sense of judgement, of assessment”, he said. “The reality is a lot of us are not performers who take to this easily. A lot of the lads are very self-conscious. We are bald, old-looking, don’t speak very well.” Some of the “mass hoppers” delivered harsh verdicts, said Hazelwood, who is based in Cork. “I know some of the lads have been very hurt by them. And then you have this thing about how many followers have you. All that judgment stuff you can intellectualise it away but it hits at your gut, at your heart. It has been hurtful. Some of the lads have stopped going [online] because they couldn’t take it.” Although online performance anxiety might sound like a Father Ted plotline updated for the Covid-19 era, Hoban said it was a serious problem for elderly, vulnerable men doing their best to cope with multiple pressures. The average age of priests in Ireland was 72, and most lived alone and many had health problems, he said. Many do not feel comfortable saying mass in an empty church under the lens of a webcam. “They don’t know where the congregation is, out there in the ether. You could watch a mass in Japan as easily as one in [county] Mayo. It could be two people or a thousand. They’re not trained with doing mass in this way.” Hoban said priests felt additional pressure from some parishioners and conservative commentators who wanted them to lobby the government to lift restrictions on churches. He said priests with underlying health conditions were nervous about large numbers attending services. The ACP has set up a confidential helpline for priests struggling with isolation but so far there have been few calls, according to Hoban. “This worries us. We know there is a need but unfortunately they’re not coming forward.” • The photograph accompanying this article was changed on 10 November 2020 to better reflect the content.

1864,Amazon charged with abusing EU competition rules,11/10/20,"Amazon has been charged by the European commission with using the sales data of independent retailers selling through its site to illegally gain an advantage in the European marketplace. The US tech firm and online retailer was accused by Brussels of using the information it collects on retailers to focus its own efforts on the bestselling products with the biggest profit margins. Margrethe Vestager, the commission’s vice-president, said the commission’s preliminary conclusion was that Amazon used “big data” to illegally distort competition in France and Germany, the biggest online retail markets in Europe. Brussels has also decided to open a second investigation into Amazon’s e-commerce business practices over concerns that the Seattle-based company set rules on its platform to benefit its own offers and those independent retailers using its logistics and delivery services. Last month, Amazon announced a third quarter income for 2020 of $6.3bn, triple that of the previous year, as an increasing number of shoppers turn to online sales amid the pandemic. Vestager told a press conference in Brussels that the commission did not have an issue with the size of the company but only with its business practices which appeared to illegally stymy the growth of its competitors. “We all know how important e-commerce is today and the current crisis has demonstrated even further that buying online is now commonplace for many, many people, people shop online more frequently and for an increasing variety of products,” Vestager said. “The value of online sales in Europe has been growing steadily. And it has almost doubled in the last five years, reaching almost €720bn this year, up from more than €370bn in 2015. “And Amazon is at the centre of this market development. More than 70% of consumers in France, and more than 80% of consumers in Germany, that made online purchases bought something from Amazon in the last 12 months. We do not take issue with the success of Amazon or its size. Our concern is very specific business contacts which appears to distort genuine competition.” Amazon has been under investigation since July during which officials analysed a data sample covering more than 18m transactions and more than 100m products.
The commission found that real time business data relating to independent retailers on the site was being fed into an algorithm used by Amazon’s own retail business. “It is based on these algorithms that Amazon decides what new products to launch, the price of each individual offer, the management of inventories and the choice of the best supplier for a product,” Vestager said. “We therefore come to the preliminary conclusion that the use of this data allows Amazon to focus on the sale of the best selling products, and this marginalises third party sellers and caps their ability to grow.” The company has been sent a formal statement of objection to which it has the opportunity to respond. In a statement Amazon said it disagreed with the findings. “There are more than 150,000 European businesses selling through our stores that generate tens of billions of euros in revenues annually,” the company said.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1865,Barcelona terror attack: three in court in Madrid,11/10/20,"Three men have appeared in court in Madrid to face trial over their alleged roles in the 2017 terror attacks in Catalonia that left 16 people dead and 140 wounded. The perpetrators of the atrocities – Spain’s worst terror attack since the Madrid train bombings in March 2004 – used a van to knock down pedestrians on Barcelona’s La Rambla boulevard on 17 August 2017 and then staged another assault the following day in the Catalan coastal town of Cambrils. Local police shot the five Cambrils attackers dead at the scene while officers killed the Barcelona attacker a few days later. Isis claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying their authors were “soldiers of the Islamic State”. One of those on trial, Mohamed Houli Chemlal, said the cell had been planning larger scale bomb attacks against targets including Barcelona’s Sagrada Familia church, but had changed their plans after an explosion tore through the house where the plotters were staying in the coastal town of Alcanar. The Catalan police, the Mossos d’Esquadra, also said the blast had deprived the group of the capacity to stage an even deadlier attack. “The explosion in Alcanar meant they no longer had the necessary material to plan larger scale attacks in Barcelona,” said Josep Lluís Trapero, head of the force at the time. “They were probably trying to carry out a different kind of attack.” Chemlal was injured in the blast, which killed two of the plotters, including Abdelbaki Es Satty, an imam suspected of radicalising and organising the cell. Prosecutors are seeking a 41-year jail term for Chemlal on charges of belonging to a terrorist organisation, possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit terrorist acts. But, like his co-accused, Chemlal is not facing murder charges. Driss Oukabir, whose brother was one of the attackers shot dead in Cambrils, faces the same charges as Chemlal, for which prosecutors are seeking a 36-year sentence. The 31-year-old has admitted hiring the van used in the Barcelona attack, but claims he believed the vehicle had been hired for a house move. The third defendant, Said Ben Iazza, 27, faces an eight-year sentence on charges of collaborating with a terror group for allegedly lending the conspirators his identity documents and a van “that he knew would be used to buy and transport chemical products”. The head of one of the victims’ associations that is acting as a civil party in the proceedings said he would push for the accused to answer for the deaths of those murdered in the attacks. “[We’re] going to fight for a murder charge and sentence for the accused ... regardless of how close or far they were from the van [used in Barcelona],” said Eulogio Paz. The trial is expected to run until 16 December.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1866,Boris Johnson phones to congratulate Joe Biden and discuss 'close' relationship,11/10/20,"Boris Johnson has spoken to Joe Biden to congratulate him on his victory over Donald Trump and allay fears Brexit could damage the Northern Ireland peace process, as world leaders lined up to speak to the US president-elect. Johnson was the second world leader to reveal he had spoken to Biden, after the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, did so on Monday. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said they had also received a call on Tuesday. “I just spoke Joe Biden to congratulate him on his election. I look forward to strengthening the partnership between our countries and to working with him on our shared priorities – from tackling climate change, to promoting democracy and building back better from the pandemic,” Johnson tweeted. Johnson and Biden are understood to have spoken for around 25 minutes from 4pm on Tuesday in a wide-ranging conversation on trade, Nato and democracy. Biden’s transition team said he thanked the prime minister for his congratulations and expressed his desire to “strengthen the special relationship” and “reaffirmed his support for the Good Friday agreement”. Downing Street said Johnson “warmly congratulated” Biden on his victory and “conveyed his congratulations to vice-president-elect Kamala Harris on her historic achievement”, but the official account did not specifically mention Brexit. However, a No 10 source said: “They talked about the importance of implementing Brexit in such a way that upholds the Good Friday agreement, and the PM assured the president-elect that would be the case.” Biden, who has Irish ancestry, has criticised Johnson’s intention to renege on parts of the EU withdrawal agreement in new Brexit legislation, and said that a US-UK trade deal was contingent on upholding the Good Friday agreement. Theresa May was 10th in line when Trump was elected in November 2016, after Ireland, Turkey, India, Japan, Mexico, Egypt, Israel, Australia and South Korea. Trump told May casually that “if you travel to the US you should let me know” – far short of an official invitation. Downing Street said the president-elect had been invited to attend the Cop26 climate crisis summit the UK was hosting in Glasgow next year, and the G7 Summit, also being hosted by the UK next year.
Johnson and Biden have never met, although Biden allies have been disparaging about the prime minister. They include a former aide to Barack Obama, who said Democrats had not forgotten about Johnson’s suggestion the “part-Kenyan” former president held an “ancestral dislike of the British empire”. However, Downing Street has emphasised that the two leaders have much in common, in particular a commitment to tackling the climate emergency, which was not shared with the Trump administration. Over the weekend, Johnson said there was “far more that unites the government of this country and government in Washington any time, any stage, than divides us”. He added: “I think now, with president Biden in the White House in Washington, we have the real prospect of American global leadership in tackling climate change. And the UK, as you know, was the first major country to set out that objective of net zero by 2050. “We led the way a few years ago. And we’re really hopeful now that president Biden will follow and will help us to deliver a really good outcome of the Cop26 summit next year in Glasgow.” Senator Chris Coons, a close friend and ally of the president-elect, said he hoped Biden would look beyond the caricature of the UK prime minister. “In my meetings with the prime minister, he’s struck me as someone who is more agile, engaging, educated and forward-looking than perhaps the caricature of him in the American press would have suggested,” he said. “I found an engaging person to meet with and speak to and it’s my hope that president-elect Biden will have a similar experience.” The UK foreign office permanent secretary, Sir Philip Barton, rejected claims that Britain was trying to have it both ways by congratulating Biden but saying that some processes were “still playing out” in the US, a reference to Trump’s refusal to accept the election result. The Labour MP Chris Bryant, a member of the committee, accused Barton of relying on inertia and presiding over a half-hearted and incompetent congratulation. He said he did not see any of the necessary flair coming from the Foreign Office to build the personal relationships on which successful diplomacy rested.

1867,"Canary Islands appeal for help as 2,200 migrants arrive over weekend",11/10/20,"The president of the Canary Islands has appealed for urgent help from the Spanish government and the EU after around 2,200 migrants arrived on the archipelago over the weekend, putting further strain on its already massively overstretched reception resources. Ángel Víctor Torres said the Canaries’ existing infrastructure could not cope with the number of people arriving, as the dangerous Atlantic route from Africa to Europe attracted more refugees and migrants. “It’s not hard to sum up,” Torres said this week. “The flow of arrivals still greatly exceeds the reception capacity. They’re absorbed, they’re distributed and they’re relocated, but the flow of arrivals is still much higher than the reception response.” The regional president pointed out that 2,188 people had reached the islands over the weekend and that they were being housed in makeshift camps on the docks at Arguineguín on Gran Canaria. Torres said the Canaries could not be used as “prison islands” where people were held indefinitely, when there was far more reception space available in mainland Spain. According to the International Organisation for Migration, more than 11,000 people have arrived in the Canaries by sea so far this year, half of them in October alone, while 414 are feared to have died in the attempt. Last year, 2,557 migrants arrived in the archipelago, up from 1,307 in 2018. This year’s figures, however, are well down on 2006, when 32,000 people arrived in the Canaries by sea. Spain’s interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, and the EU’s commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, visited the islands last week. At a press conference on Friday, Johansson paid tribute to the “tremendous efforts” of the central and regional governments in managing the situation in such difficult times. But Torres asked for help that went beyond words, saying: “We’re not in a planning phase, we’re in a reaction phase.” He said the Covid-19 pandemic was making things ever harder, called for urgent action to dismantle the Arguineguín camp and appealed for the EU to make good on the “shared European commitment” to managing migration. Spain’s interior ministry, meanwhile, has been criticised for refusing to allow journalists to document the plight of those stuck on the Arguineguín docks. Judith Sunderland, Human Rights Watch’s acting deputy director for Europe and central Asia, visited the Canaries over the weekend and described the conditions on the docks as “pretty awful”. She said the Spanish authorities had been slow to act, even after it became clear that the Atlantic route was opening up again. “The numbers surged and all of a sudden, it’s emergency mode and that’s when things get really bad,” she said. “There are two systemic problems, which are the lack of sufficient reception spaces on the islands and then the failure of the central government to systematically, routinely, and in significant numbers, transfer people to the mainland. Those are two very clear solutions.” Sunderland said she had spoken to some women on the docks who had been in the hot, crowded camp for more than two weeks. The longer the migrants and refugees stayed in the area, she said, the worse things would get. “They need to transfer people to the mainland,” she said. “That would alleviate the extreme pressure on the islands right now, which is a recipe for disaster.” Sunderland recognised that Spain, like Italy, had been badly affected by the pandemic, but said it needed to overhaul its “shortsighted and poor” policymaking. “This is a challenge – but it’s not something that Spain can’t handle in a humane way,” she said. “Of course it can; it’s just a lack of will and coordination and a bit of money.” In February, Spain’s migration ministry set up its own management centre in Tenerife with the capacity to accommodate 300-400 people and is about to open another centre. But the secretary of state for migration, Hana Jalloul, said the numbers of people arriving were overwhelming the islands’ reception resources. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, says the Atlantic route is having a resurgence in popularity because of enduring conflicts, land border closures due to coronavirus and increased controls in some north African countries. At least 140 people died last month after a boat carrying 200 people caught fire and capsized off the coast of Senegal in the deadliest shipwreck recorded this year.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1868,"Child sexual abuse in Catholic church was ‘swept under the carpet’, inquiry finds",11/10/20,"Pope Francis asked Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales, to stay in his post, despite a damning report that criticised his leadership and concluded that the church repeatedly prioritised its reputation over the welfare of child sex abuse victims. In its final review of the church, the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) said the Vatican’s failure to cooperate with the investigation “passes understanding”. The 162-page report said “the church’s neglect of the physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing of children and young people in favour of protecting its reputation was in conflict with its mission of love and care for the innocent and vulnerable.” Of Nichols, it stated: “There was no acknowledgment of any personal responsibility to lead or influence change. Nor did he demonstrate compassion towards victims in the recent cases which we examined.” Calls for Nichols’s resignation grew in the wake of the publication of the report on Tuesday. An anonymous survivor who gave evidence told the Guardian: “Cardinal Nichols is the moral leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales, he has lost all moral authority and must go … This report once again demonstrates that the Catholic church is not a safe place for children.” Members of the survivors group White Flowers Alba called upon Cardinal Nichols and the present papal nuncio, Archbishop Adams, to “resign immediately”. Another victim, identified by the inquiry only as A711, said: “The church needs a seismic shift in culture, especially at the top. If there is any hope at all of real change it will require a relinquishing of power, and a will to treat survivors as human beings.” Between 1970 and 2015, the church in England and Wales received more than 900 complaints involving more than 3,000 instances of child sexual abuse, made against more than 900 individuals, including priests, monks and volunteers. The sexual abuse of children involved instances of “masturbation, oral sex, vaginal rape and anal rape”. On occasions, the inquiry says, it was accompanied by “sadistic beatings driven by sexual gratification” as well as “deeply manipulative behaviour by those in positions of trust”. One child estimated that between the ages of 11 and 15 he had been abused hundreds of times by a priest. “After each incident he was required to make confession, and the priest concerned made it plain that his sister’s place at a local convent school depended on his compliance,” the report says. When complaints were made, the church invariably failed to support victims and survivors but took action to protect alleged perpetrators by moving them to a different parish. “Child sexual abuse,” the report says, “was swept under the carpet.” The inquiry asked the Vatican’s ambassador to the UK, the papal nuncio, to participate. “Very limited information was forthcoming,” the report says. “After several months of correspondence, the Holy See belatedly confirmed it would not provide a witness statement. “Their lack of cooperation passes understanding.” Prof Alexis Jay, the chair of the inquiry, said: “For decades, the Catholic church’s failure to tackle child sexual abuse consigned many more children to the same fate. It is clear that the church’s reputation was valued above the welfare of victims, with allegations ignored and perpetrators protected. Even today, the responses of the Holy See appear at odds with the pope’s promise to take action on this hugely important problem.” Richard Scorer, a solicitor at the law firm Slater and Gordon, which represented 32 survivors, said: “Cardinal Nichols needs to resign right away – in any other walk of life he would be gone immediately. This is a church that cannot be trusted to protect children. The only way forward now is a mandatory reporting law, so that abuse cannot be covered up, and independent external oversight of church safeguarding. ” One survivor represented by Slater and Gordon who gave evidence before the inquiry said: “Vincent Nichols will retire with a full pension – meanwhile, the victims that he denied justice to have to live on, still suffering. “The fact is Nichols is a serial protector of paedophiles and he is the person that you should least expect it from. The head of a church should have the greatest morals of all but instead they were sending paedophiles to other areas of the country – and America – in an attempt to cover the abuse up.” David Enright, a solicitor at Howe & Co, which represented 20 of the victims, said: “The church has had many, many chances to reform and root out child abuse. It has failed. It is with heavy hearts that my clients, many of them devout Catholics, conclude that the only safe course of action is to take safeguarding of children out of the hands of the Catholic church and into the hands of accountable lay professionals.” Responding to calls for Nichols’ departure, a church spokesperson said the cardinal would not be resigning following the inquiry’s criticisms because he was “determined to put it right”. In accordance with Vatican rules, Nichols wrote to the Holy See about four weeks ago in the run-up to his 75th birthday, which was on Sunday, to offer his resignation. Pope Francis had asked him to continue as a cardinal, the spokesperson said. A statement issued by Nichols and the archbishop of Liverpool, Malcolm McMahon, said the Catholic church welcomed the report, which would “inform” improvements in “safeguarding in all aspects of the church’s life”. It added: “We apologise to all victims and survivors who have not been properly listened to, or properly supported by us.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1869,Coronavirus: anti-vaxxers seek to discredit Pfizer's vaccine,11/10/20,"Anti-vaxxers have seized on the promising results of a new coronavirus vaccine, attempting to discredit the Pfizer/BioNTech development on social media within hours of it being announced. After the news broke that interim analysis suggested the vaccine had 90% effectiveness, “Bill Gates” began trending on Twitter The Microsoft founder has been one of the most popular targets for conspiracy theorists because of his work on vaccines.
While some were poking fun at the conspiracy theories, others subscribed to views expressed by the disgraced US researcher Dr Judy Mikovits in the viral Plandemic video, in which she blames the coronavirus outbreak on a conspiracy led by big pharma, Gates and the World Health Organization. The conspiracy was repeated by a caller to BBC Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine show on Tuesday, who claimed “Bill Gates is behind this” and accused him of seeking material gain. Just over an hour after Boris Johnson finished a press conference in which he sought to manage expectations following the interim results for the vaccine – which must gain regulatory approval before it is rolled out – Louise Creffield from Save Our Rights UK, which has campaigned against lockdown, made a Facebook live response. In the video, she said: “There’s been no safety data yet, it hasn’t been peer-reviewed, there is a lot of indemnity to it and the MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency], who are going to be the ones that approve it or not, we have found out, well, one, they’re a government body so they are paid for by the government, and two they’ve received nearly £1m in funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. So the likelihood that they are a robustly independent body like Boris Johnson said is slim to none.” Johnson was explicit in saying there was no safety data for the vaccine and it has not been peer-reviewed. Creffield also voiced scepticism about the speed at which the vaccine has been developed. She suggested the “presence of the army is coercive” – a reference to Johnson being flanked at the press conference by Brigadier Joe Fossey, who was there to talk about military support for mass testing in Liverpool. Heidi Larson, director of the London-based Vaccine Confidence Project, said: “There’s a lot of language out there about speed but we haven’t really talked about why things are faster and it’s not because we’re shortcutting old processes. “These new Covid vaccines are on brand new platforms. There’s never been an mRNA vaccine [which uses the genetic code rather than any part of the virus itself] before for humans. So, this Pfizer vaccine, for instance, would be absolutely brand new, made in a new way.” While social media companies have removed some of the most extreme content – in relation to the Plandemic video for instance – Larson said it was difficult for them to police content that was more ambiguous or posted by organisations with innocuous-sounding names, or to prevent it being moved to another platform. “I think the biggest problem with all these misinformation efforts is that we’re not there with alternatives and we’re not listening,” she said. “Anti/sceptical vaccine individuals and groups are actively seeking out people who are questioning and hesitant, and they are right there, waiting to say: ‘You’re right, you have a good reason to be concerned, there is a problem.’ We’re just saying ‘Don’t worry’ and not really saying: ‘Tell me about your concern.’” Prof Melinda Mills, from the University of Oxford and lead author of Covid-19 vaccine deployment, a report published on Tuesday by the British Academy and the Royal Society for the Set-C (Science in Emergencies Tasking: Covid-19) group, echoed Larson’s views. “Vaccines are one of the most amazing discoveries … they’ve saved millions of lives and we often forget that because we’re not surrounded by measles and polio and smallpox. But I do think so much focus on the medical science and so much focus on the vaccines has left us with a real blind spot into how people see them.” Creffield said the Pfizer vaccine being based on new technology increased the need for scrutiny. “I’m not about feeding conspiracy theories – I’m just about making sure that we have the full facts of the matter, including about where these things are coming from,” she told the Guardian. “If there’s questions on any of those answers … that doesn’t mean necessarily it’s untrustworthy and that you shouldn’t take part in whatever it is. It just means you need to satisfy that … nothing untoward is going on.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1870,"Covid vaccine could be ready for rollout next month, says Hancock",11/10/20,"Matt Hancock has sounded a note of caution over the prospect of a Covid-19 vaccine, stressing that “we’re not there yet” – but revealed he has asked the NHS to be ready for rollout as soon as next month. The UK health secretary indicated he anticipated a “mass rollout” would happen in the first part of next year if the vaccine was given the green light, although he said he had requested the NHS, supported by the armed forces, to be ready from the start of December. Priority for the vaccine will go to people in care homes, elderly people and social care staff. It will be delivered through care homes, GPs and pharmacists, as well as “go-to” centres set up in venues such as sports halls. “We will be working across the NHS with the support of the armed forces seven days a week, over weekends, over bank holidays, to get this rolled out into people’s arms as quickly as possible,” Hancock told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday. The vaccine would not be required for children and uptake would be voluntary, Hancock said.
There was widespread optimism after it emerged that an interim analysis indicated that Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine was 90% effective in protecting people from transmission of the virus in global trials. But Hancock said it would not be administered to the population unless it was proven to be clinically safe. “I think that this is a promising step forward but there’s many steps that still need to be taken. Perhaps the most important to stress is that we’ve seen the effectiveness data but we will not license a vaccine unless it is clinically safe and we haven’t seen the final safety data,” Hancock said later on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “So that is the biggest hurdle still to come and if that fails then … it doesn’t matter how effective this vaccine is, we won’t deploy it. And then, of course, there’s the enormous challenge of the rollout.” The UK government had bought 40m doses of the vaccine, he said, adding: “It takes two doses 21 days apart, it has to be stored until the last few hours before deployment at -70C, and this is going to be a colossal effort to roll this out, which the NHS is leading. “We’ve been working on it for months in anticipation of this going right. We haven’t got a vaccine yet, we’re not there yet. But we are one important step closer and we’re ready, we’ll be ready to deploy it.” Pressed on how long the process to establish the safety of the vaccine would be, Hancock said: “We’re talking most likely weeks, however it happens at the speed of the science.”
If cleared, Hancock confirmed it was a possibility that some of the vaccine could be ready for use by Christmas. “My central expectation is that the mass rollout of this vaccine will, if it comes good, be in the first part of next year,” he said. Separately, Hancock told Sky News on Tuesday: “I’ve asked the NHS, who are supported by the armed services in this – but the NHS very much leading this effort for deploying the vaccine – I’ve asked them to be ready from the start of December.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1871,Covid vaccine tracker: when will a coronavirus vaccine be ready?,11/10/20,"Researchers around the world are racing to develop a vaccine against Covid-19, with more than 170 candidate vaccines now tracked by the World Health Organization (WHO). Vaccines normally require years of testing and additional time to produce at scale, but scientists are hoping to develop a coronavirus vaccine within 12 to 18 months. Vaccines mimic the virus – or part of the virus – they protect against, stimulating the immune system to develop antibodies. They must follow higher safety standards than other drugs because they are given to millions of healthy people.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1872,Devastating 2020 Atlantic hurricane season breaks all records,11/10/20,"The annual record for the number of major storms forming in the Atlantic has been shattered, with Subtropical Storm Theta becoming the 29th named event in a hyperactive hurricane season. The US National Hurricane Center said the development of Theta, currently churning through the heart of the Atlantic, had broken a record that stood since 2005, when there were 28 named storms. Yet another named storm could be in the works, with meteorologists tracking one through the Caribbean. There have been so many big storms in 2020 that meteorologists exhausted their English-language list of names and had to turn to the Greek alphabet, rapidly burning through Alpha to Eta. In September, there were five storms lined up in the Atlantic at once. “I think everyone feels surprised by the number of storms we’ve seen,” said Jill Trepanier, an extreme weather expert at Louisiana State University. “The sheer number has surpassed my expectations.” Storms are named once they hit a wind speed of 39mph, with 12 of 2020’s named storms accelerating further to become hurricanes. A record 12 named storms and six hurricanes have crunched into the US so far this year, with some communities repeatedly besieged by strong winds and flooding. Parts of southern Louisiana were devastated by Hurricane Laura in late August, which brought 150mph winds and severe flooding that claimed 42 lives, only to then be pummelled again by Hurricane Delta and Hurricane Zeta last month. The frequency of major storms making damaging landfall is the “big story for 2020” in terms of the hurricane season, said Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. The hurricane season of 2020, which officially starts in June, has killed dozens of people and caused tens of billions of dollars in damage to homes, power lines and workplaces during a time of overlapping economic and social crises. Robert Bullard, an environmental policy expert at Texas Southern University, said: “It is the most vulnerable communities who will likely get hit the hardest, the same communities that are trying to recover from previous storms and ravages of Covid-19.” The flurry of storms is well beyond the bounds of normal expectations, with an average of 11 named storms occurring each year from the 1980s to 2010. It is unclear whether the climate crisis is causing more frequent storms, although scientists are increasingly confident that the rising temperatures of the atmosphere and ocean are causing stronger hurricanes. Hotter water provides more energy to hurricanes, while extra warmth in the air causes a build-up of moisture that can come down as flood-causing rainfall. The extra heat is helping spur the rapid intensification of storms, as witnessed during Laura, when wind speeds leapt from 65mph to 110mph within a single day. Incredibly, a few weeks later Hurricane Sally surged from 60mph to 100mph in just 12 hours before barrelling into Alabama’s coast. “Rapid intensification seems to be the name of the game right now,” Trepanier said. “We should expect to see events intensify quickly when conditions are as warm as they are presently.” Much like the high temperatures experienced by the Arctic or the enormous wildfires that have chewed through California this year, climate scientists warn there will be more and stronger hurricanes as the world heats up further. The science is “quite clear that we should expect more high intensity hurricanes and much more rain from them”, warned Kerry Emanuel, a professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1873,Far-right Essex councillor censured for posting anti-asylum seeker video,11/10/20,"An Essex councillor from the far-right organisation For Britain has been sanctioned for breaching his council’s code of conduct after being accused of inciting racial hatred in an anti-asylum seeker video he posted on YouTube. A series of sanctions against For Britain councillor Julian Leppert were agreed at a meeting of Epping Forest district council on Tuesday. Leppert posted a video, which can still be seen on YouTube, in July called The Epping Migrant Hotel Scandal. He appears on the video with Eddy Butler, the BNP’s former election chief. The video claimed that the 79-room Bell Hotel in Epping, which the Home Office was using to accommodate asylum seekers, was being used by asylum seekers and illegal immigrants who had come to the UK to exploit the benefits system, that the asylum seekers posed a security risk to local people, had caused an increase in shoplifting and pickpocketing and had diverted food intended for local people at the food bank 3food4U to their hotel. When questioned about these claims at a meeting of the council’s standards committee on Tuesday evening Leppert was unable to substantiate any of the allegations. When asked what would be an acceptable number of asylum seekers to be housed in the area he replied: “None.” Leppert was attacking the asylum seekers housed by the Home Office in the Bell Hotel at a time when other far-right groups were entering hotels accommodating asylum seekers and harassing them. When asked previously by the Observer if he was advocating a whites-only enclave in the area, he replied: “Ideally, yeah.” The council received seven complaints about the video, four from members of the public, one from a doctor who had a patient at the Bell hotel, one from a councillor and one from the Helen Bamber Foundation, a charity that provides support to asylum seekers. The doctor said that her patient who was housed in the Bell hotel and other asylum seekers there had experienced racist abuse from local groups, which she believed was as a result of the YouTube video. According to a report to the council’s committee “she said that the video had included the spreading of lies to incite hatred.” A report to tonight’s committee said: “Councillors are representatives of the council and the public will see their actions as being an illustration of the views of the council.” But the report added that these views were not shared by the council. Leppert invoked his right to freedom of opinion under the UN Declaration of Human Rights. “Many of my political colleagues are all for human rights with regard to asylum seekers and illegal immigrants but when it comes to British people not so much,” he said. He described the meeting where the sanctions against him were agreed as “a politically motivated kangaroo court”. He admitted to not having read the council’s code of conduct although he had signed it. The sanctions agreed against him by his fellow councillors include a formal censure and a requirement to undergo equality and diversity training. Zoe Dexter, welfare and housing manager at the Helen Bamber Foundation, said after the meeting: “People seeking asylum, many of whom are exceptionally vulnerable, have the right to pursue their asylum claim in the UK, and to do this free from abuse. The far-right protests and actions around asylum accommodation this summer were racist and stoked hate against asylum seekers. The councillor’s actions were unacceptable, particularly from someone in public office, and we welcome the council’s decision to find that he has broken their code of conduct. “",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1874,Fiji death in custody reignites debate over police brutality,11/10/20,"Witnesses have rejected police claims a Fijian man who died in police custody jumped from a two-storey building to his death, instead alleging he was beaten by officers, reigniting debate across Fiji over the use of force by police officers and allegations of systematic brutality. The death in violent circumstances of Mesake Sinu, a 46-year-old indigenous Fijian man from Nadi, prompted Rusiate Tudravu, the acting commissioner of Fiji’s police force, to condemn indiscipline among his own officers and order an investigation into Sinu’s death. Tudravu told local media “a thorough investigation will … ascertain the circumstances surrounding the victim’s death and those found responsible will be charged and produced before a court of law”.
But the commissioner did not respond to multiple phone calls and detailed emails from the Guardian regarding the police’s internal investigation into Sinu’s death and wider allegations of police brutality. Figures from Fiji’s director of public prosecution obtained exclusively by the Guardian show that 400 charges of serious violence were laid against police officers between May 2015 and April 2020. Sixteen charges of rape were laid against police in that five-year period, two charges of murder, and nine of manslaughter. More than 110 charges of assault were brought against officers. Other charges include perjury, abduction, conspiracy, and aiding prisoners to escape. Fiji police did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for statistics on convictions.
A spokesman for the Fiji police force earlier alleged Sinu, a suspect in a 2015 bank robbery, died from injuries sustained after he jumped from a double-storey building following a robbery. However, a post-mortem ruled out the fall as a possible cause of death, police later admitted. Sinu died from a “traumatic head injury” caused by “blunt force trauma”. And witness accounts flatly oppose claims made by the police. In a video posted to facebook, Lewa Kuriako, who said she was present with Sinu on the morning of the incident, claimed there was “no truth to the allegation of robbery” and alleged that the version of events provided publicly by Fiji police was false. “If you want to know the truth, we are many witnesses who are all available and ready to answer questions and give evidence as witnesses to the killing of Mesake Sinu. “We saw with our very own eyes and we actually witnessed what happened.” Kuriako alleged that at about 3.30am on the morning of 12 October at least nine police officers in civilian clothes forced their way into a house in Nasau, Nadi, where Sinu was staying. “When the police got here the first thing they did to us was break down our door … and punched up all the males in the house, including Mesake Sinu,” she alleged. “The officers chased Mr Sinu and he tried to escape and jumped out of the house. The fall was about two metres and not a double-storey building as police said.” Kuriako alleged police officers then “rounded him up and assaulted him”. “They also smashed a glass bottle on him and dragged him inside the twin cab [police vehicle]. “There was a deep cut on his forehead and blood kept oozing out.” Kuriako’s online testimony has been viewed more than 120,000 times and widely shared across Fiji. Allegations of human rights abuses have been previously made against Fiji’s military and police forces. In June five police officers allegedly threw a man off a bridge and are currently on bail facing charges for causing grievous bodily harm, common assault, and interfering with a witness. They have each entered not guilty pleas. In the same month another officer allegedly assaulted a man at his home on the outskirts of the capital. And in August police officers allegedly assaulted a man at Nausori police station. Two days before Sinu’s death, on 10 October, a 21-year-old man was severely beaten at his home, allegedly by four non-uniformed police officers in Suva. He was arrested for breaking curfew and drinking in public. Police have defended their actions, saying the man obstructed police and resisted arrest. The string of recent cases has prompted the country’s human rights watchdog to launch its own investigation.
“Fiji has an effective and transparent criminal justice system,” said Ashwin Raj, director of Fiji’s human rights and anti-discrimination commission. Raj said the commission had seen a copy of Sinu’s death certificate which stated the cause of death was “extensive intracranial haemorrhage due to severe traumatic head injury”. The external cause of injury was “blunt force trauma”. “I have every confidence in the criminal justice system that it will operate transparently and hold those responsible for this heinous act of violence to account,” Raj said. “We have nearly concluded our investigations … and we will be giving our report to the Fiji police force.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1875,Gunmen shoot dead female Libyan dissident in busy Benghazi street,11/10/20,"Gunmen have shot dead a prominent female dissident on a busy street in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, in the latest killing of a critic of military strongman Khalifa Haftar. Hanan al-Barassi, an outspoken critic of abuses in the eastern areas controlled by Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), was shot dead in her car in broad daylight on 20th Street, a busy artery in Benghazi’s city centre, rights groups and security officials said. A prominent figure in Libya, 46-year-old Barassi was known for giving voice to female victims of violence in videos that she broadcast on social media. She also ran a local association for the defence of women’s rights. In the footage posted to her Facebook page just before she was shot, Barassi speaks to the camera while seated in her car and criticises armed groups close to Haftar, saying she had been “threatened”. Barassi’s killing comes nearly a year and a half after the disappearance of another prominent women’s rights activist, Siham Sergiwa, who was abducted from her home in Benghazi by armed men on 17 July and has not been heard from since. Before her abduction, Sergiwa had criticised an offensive launched by Haftar in April last year to take the capital Tripoli from the United Nations-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA). Relatives believe the former doctor was silenced by forces loyal to the 77-year-old strongman. The latest murder has prompted an outcry across Libya, with many on social media demanding justice. News of Barassi’s killing “is appalling and a painful reminder of the reality on the ground especially for women”, said Elham Saudi, a Libyan lawyer who is also known for her defence of human rights. “With no accountability, violators will continue to get away with literal murder in broad daylight.” Amnesty International said Barassi and her daughter had received death threats. The organisation noted that her social media page had said on Monday she planned to release a video accusing Haftar’s son of corruption. “The assassination of Hanan highlights the risk posed to the lives of women who speak up on political issues in Libya,” the organisation said in a statement. Neither the LNA nor other authorities in eastern Libya immediately released any statement about the killing. Libya has been wracked by conflict since the overthrow and killing of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in a Nato-backed uprising in 2011. It has since been dominated by armed groups and divided since 2014 between the GNA and Haftar’s administration in the east. Both represent coalitions of armed groups as well as regional and political factions. Turkey supports the GNA, while the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt back the LNA. All powers have fuelled the conflict, some sending weapons, ammunition or mercenaries. Hanan Salah of Human Rights Watch called the killing of Barassi “frightening and chilling”. It is “reminiscent of other crimes of this kind for which nobody has ever been punished. Authorities in the east must investigate quickly and hold the criminals accountable,” she wrote on Twitter. In June the LNA offensive on Tripoli ended in failure and a permanent ceasefire was agreed in October. Frontlines have since solidified near Sirte on Libya’s central Mediterranean coast. Libyan representatives from all sides began direct talks in Tunisia on Monday, under the aegis of the UN, aimed at finding a political solution to the conflict and a path to elections and the formation of a unified transitional government. On Tuesday, Fatou Bensouda, the international criminal court lead prosecutor, told the United Nations security council that her office has been following reports of the targeting of civilians that voiced opposition to militias in the east and west of Libya. “We have received information indicating that the … offensive on Tripoli that was carried out by the [LNA] and its supporting forces, forms part of a pattern of violence that involves indiscriminate airstrikes and shelling of civilian areas; arbitrary abduction; detention and torture of civilians; extrajudicial killings; enforced disappearances; and pillaging of civilian property,” Bensouda said.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1876,Hopes rise for end of pandemic as Pfizer says vaccine has 90% efficacy,11/10/20,"Hopes are soaring that a Covid vaccine is within reach, following news that an interim analysis has shown Pfizer/BioNTech’s candidate to have 90% efficacy in protecting people from transmission of the virus in global trials. The vaccine performed much better than most experts had hoped for, according to the companies’ analysis, and brings into view a potential end to a pandemic that has killed more than a million people, battered economies and upended daily life worldwide. The data is from an interim analysis and the trial continues into December but the headline results were emphatic. Regulators will be looking to process an emergency licence application at record speed. Global stocks surged to record highs on the news, while companies that have become synonymous with lockdowns in the west, including Zoom’s video conferencing and food delivery firms, saw falls in their value. John Bell, Regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, who is involved with the Oxford vaccine, said that the Pfizer team had shown “an amazing level of efficacy” and it could mean a return to normality by spring (efficacy connotes performance of the vaccine under the orderly conditions of a trial, as distinct from use in everyday life). “I’m the first guy to say that but I will say it with some confidence,” he told the BBC. Manufacturing is already under way. Pfizer said they expect to supply globally up to 50m vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3bn doses in 2021. Countries will decide who they prioritise for vaccination. In the UK, the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation has recommended that – presuming the vaccines work well enough in elderly people – the first vaccines go to care home workers and residents, followed by anybody over 80 and other health and social care workers. After that, people are expected to get them in decreasing age order. The news comes too late to help Donald Trump’s re-election campaign in the US, but the vice-president, Mike Pence, tried to claim their administration’s Operation Warp Speed programme had helped the vaccine’s development. Pfizer denied the suggestion.
“We were never part of the Warp Speed,” Kathrin Jansen, a senior vice-president and the head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, said in an interview. “We have never taken any money from the US government, or from anyone.” BioNTech, the small biotechnology company that is the originator of the vaccine, was founded by two married German scientists, Uğur Şahin and Özlem Türeci, both born to Turkish immigrant parents, and the Austrian oncologist Christopher Huber. It originally set out to develop new types of immunotherapy for cancer, but has concentrated its capacities on the race for a Covid-19 vaccine. There are so far no safety concerns around the vaccine, with the two companies reporting no serious side-effects. The high percentage of those protected makes it especially compelling. Regulators have previously said they would approve a vaccine that has just a 50% efficacy rate – protecting half of those who get vaccinated. “Today is a great day for science and humanity. The first set of results from our phase 3 Covid-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent Covid-19,” said Dr Albert Bourla, the Pfizer chairman and chief executive. “We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development programme at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen.”
Other scientists tried to marry caution with their obvious excitement at the early results, warning that the full data was not yet available and that the trial was continuing. “In the absence of any data from Pfizer and BioNTech, we have to take these very exciting claims at face value,” said Dr Simon Clarke, an associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading. “It seems highly unlikely that a major pharmaceutical company would get such eagerly awaited news wrong.” Prof Peter Horby of Oxford University, who runs the Recovery Covid drug trial, said it seemed like an important moment. “This news made me smile from ear to ear,” he said. “It is a relief to see such positive results on this vaccine and bodes well for Covid-19 vaccines in general. Of course we need to see more detail and await the final results, and there is a long, long way to go before vaccines will start to make a real difference, but this feels to me like a watershed moment.” As news of the breakthrough buoyed the scientific community, Brazil’s health regulator said it had suspended a clinical trial for China’s Sinovac coronavirus vaccine citing a severe adverse event. Trial organisers said there had been a death but it was unrelated to the vaccine. The health regulator, Anvisa, said on Monday the “adverse event” took place on 29 October but did not specify if the incident took place in Brazil or in another country. It also did not give an indication of how long the suspension of the large late-stage trial might last. Pfizer/BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine, which uses the genetic code rather than any part of the virus itself, has been one of the leaders in the global vaccine race. Interim results are also expected this month or in early December from trials for the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, which is based on a different technology.
The phase 3 trials have involved more than 43,000 people and are intended to establish whether the vaccine works. Volunteers are given either the Covid vaccine, which was administered in two shots about three weeks apart, or a placebo alternative such as the meningitis vaccine, and neither they nor their doctors know which they have had. There have been concerns that black and minority ethnic populations are particularly vulnerable to Covid. Approximately 42% of global participants and 30% of US participants in the trials have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds and appear to have been as well-protected as everyone else, the company says. But one important unanswered question is how long the vaccine will last. The US and UK both welcomed the development but urged patience. “I congratulate the brilliant women and men who helped produce this breakthrough and to give us so much cause for hope,” the US president-elect, Joe Biden, said. “It is also important to understand that the end of the battle against Covid-19 is still months away … a mask remains a more potent weapon against the virus than a vaccine. Today’s news does not change this urgent reality.” The UK’s prime minister and deputy medical adviser warned that nobody should assume the pandemic was over and let down their guard. “We can’t let our enthusiasm run away with us,” said Boris Johnson, adding that the public must continue to observe the lockdown restrictions. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said the results showed the vaccine prevented disease, but “we don’t know what this means yet for when we can get life back to normal … please don’t relax.”
Many countries already have orders for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The UK has bought 40m doses – enough for 20 million people because two doses are required. The EU has secured 200m doses, which it will distribute. The companies have a $1.95bn (£1.5bn) contract with the US government to deliver 100m vaccine doses beginning this year.
Low-income countries could face problems, however, because the vaccine needs ultra-cold chain; it must be stored at -70C. The BioNTech chief executive, Uğur Şahin, has said his company is researching whether the vaccine might be able to survive for up to five days at a normal fridge temperature of 4C. In Germany, the government is planning to set up vaccination centres equipped with ultra-low-temperature freezers for the first phase of vaccinations. • This article was amended on 18 November 2020 to clarify that results of vaccine trials at this stage refer to “efficacy” – the performance of an intervention under ideal and controlled circumstances – not “effectiveness”, which describes performance under real-world conditions.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1877,‘I began to lose hope’: the people living with post-Covid psychiatric disorders,11/10/20,"A study from researchers at the University of Oxford and NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre found that nearly one in five people who have had Covid-19 were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder – such as anxiety, depression or insomnia – within three months of testing positive for the virus. We speak to survivors about their experiences. Eleanor, 35, therapist, Hertfordshire Before catching Covid, Eleanor had no diagnosed mental health conditions, although she suspects she had low-level anxiety. Post-Covid, the situation is very different: Eleanor is seeing a private therapist to help with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. Eleanor said the deterioration of her mental health was, at least in part, down to her workplace and GP not taking her symptoms seriously when she fell ill at the end of March. “I was told by my line manager that it couldn’t be Covid-19 as I didn’t have a persistent cough for over an hour. As my symptoms worsened over two weeks, I was told by GP that it was likely anxiety and that my lethargy could be explained as many found it hard to motivate themselves at this time,” she said. She eventually got so sick that she coughed up the mucous lining from her lungs. There was no initial access to testing, and by the time a test was available through her workplace, Eleanor was so unwell she could not attend. Barely able to stand, Eleanor spent some nights wondering if she would still be able to breathe the next day. By week eight she was still experiencing a fever. Her GP said it now seemed likely that she had had Covid. Eleanor said that while there were other stressors, including having to postpone her wedding by several months, she believes the reaction of others to her illness took a toll on her mental health. “I think I was just so distressed and upset at not being believed or taken seriously,” she said.
Sophie, 26, support worker, Hampshire Having fallen ill with suspected Covid in March, Sophie went on to develop panic attacks that lasted for entire days. “Every day I was like: ‘I am going to be dead, I am going to be dead,’ even though I didn’t have it as bad as some people in the hospitals who were on ventilators and stuff,” said Sophie. Sophie said she was still anxious and continued to take medication for her mental health, months after the virus passed. “Everything seems to be just so built up in my head. Even just going to the shop is just stressful,” she said, adding that she had not had mental health problems before catching Covid. While Sophie does not know why she has been left with anxiety, she said a number of factors could have contributed, from the lack of access to testing making it unclear whether she had Covid, to the constant stream of news about coronavirus and deaths. “It could have been the feeling of just being breathless – you feel like you can’t breathe,” she said. Jane, 66, bookkeeper, Welsh borders Jane had experienced depression before she caught the coronavirus, but after falling ill with Covid she experienced the worst episode for 15 years. Jane’s main symptom, at least at first, was a nasty cough that lasted for three weeks. But after that passed, she was left with extreme fatigue, replacing hour-long walks with just 15 minutes’ exercise before needing to rest. The fatigue was accompanied by severe depression. “I have had depression in the past, and quite seriously, but have been able to manage it with generally looking after myself and fresh air, good food [and so on],” she said. But this time it was different. “I was beginning to make plans to kill myself, drawing up lists of who needed to be informed, what I needed to do,” said Jane. Jane consulted a psychologist, who also recommended she talk to a doctor about her fatigue and physical illness. The GP said “all the symptoms absolutely point to it having been Covid”, said Jane. As for why Covid triggered the depression, Jane said she believes it was down to the virus itself, whether directly or indirectly. “I was just so tired all the time,” she said, adding that it made it difficult to do daily tasks such as washing up. “Also I began to lose hope that I would resurface because I just felt so lousy. I felt that I had aged 10-15 years, and it was quite scary thinking: ‘Is this it, really? Will I ever bounce back from that?’” The fatigue and depression lasted about four months and Jane said she felt more forgetful than in the past. “Now I am about 90% right, physically and mentally,” she said. • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

1878,Italian man serenades wife of 47 years at hospital window,11/10/20,"An 81-year-old Italian man who serenaded his wife from beneath her hospital window said he was simply following his heart. Stefano Bozzini, who was unable to visit his wife, Carla, in hospital due to Covid-19 restrictions, instead played songs on his accordion that have defined their love. The romantic gesture took place on Sunday morning in the courtyard of the hospital in Castel San Giovanni, a town in the northern Emilia-Romagna region, and was captured in a widely-shared video. “I did it for Carla – to show her how much I love her and to thank her for all she has given me,” Bozzini said. “I wasn’t able to see her in hospital and so went to the courtyard with the accordion – my heart told me to go. After she heard the music she looked out of the window, so at least I got to see her.” The first song he played was Spanish Eyes by Engelbert Humperdinck. “She was so in love with that song, I play it all the time at home,” he said. “I played others that everyone knows, one song after the other, I didn’t stop. A lot of the sick people in the hospital were looking out of their windows.” Carla, 74, was discharged on Monday after spending 10 days in hospital as medics carried out tests for suspected cancer. The hospital in Castel San Giovanni doesn’t treat Covid-19 patients but visitors are banned in case they bring the virus in. “They offered to bring her home in an ambulance. I said no, I’m coming to get her straightaway. We’re by each other’s side all the time. The illness she has is very serious and will now need treatment in a specialist hospital.” Bozzini, a retired member of the Italian army’s Alpini mountain infantry, wore a Cappello Alpino, a distinctive green hat with a raven feather on the side that forms part of the uniform, while serenading Carla. He was nicknamed “Gianni Morandi”, after the Italian singer, by fellow troops because he never stopped playing the accordion. “I love music, and when I play the accordion it brings fun and happiness everywhere,” he said. “What is happening in the world right now is so horrible we need music to help lift the spirits.” The couple met when they were in their 20s and have been married for 47 years. They have three children, but lost their youngest to cancer at the age of 25. Castel San Giovanni, where the couple have lived all their lives, is close to the border of Lombardy, the region worst hit by the coronavirus. “We try and stay home as much as possible to not risk getting Covid,” said Bozzini. “But it is important to look with the eyes and heart, and to try and help others as much as possible.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1879,Jair Bolsonaro claims 'victory' after suspension of Chinese vaccine trial,11/10/20,"The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has sparked outrage by gloating over the suspension of clinical trials of the Chinese coronavirus vaccine after a volunteer’s death. “Another victory for Jair Bolsonaro,” read a comment posted by the official Facebook account of Brazil’s far-right leader on Monday night after the country’s health regulator, Anvisa, announced it had halted testing of the CoronaVac jab. Anvisa said the trial of the vaccine – which is being developed by the Chinese biopharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech – had been suspended as a result of a “adverse, serious event” involving a participant in Brazil. But many Bolsonaro critics see a possible political motivation behind the move, and the head of the Brazilian research centre coordinating the trial claimed the volunteer’s death was not related to the vaccine. The broadcaster TV Cultura reported on Tuesday that the “event” was suicide, saying it had seen the coroner’s report showing the trial volunteer had taken their own life.
The CoronaVac is being developed in partnership with the São Paulo-based research centre Butantan and has been championed by São Paulo’s state governor, João Doria, who is one of Bolsonaro’s biggest political foes. That rivalry has placed the CoronaVac at the centre of a growing political brawl with Doria, who many believe will challenge Bolsonaro for the presidency in 2022, who promised to implement a compulsory vaccination scheme in his state while the president opposed such a move. On Monday night Bolsonaro wrote on Facebook: “This is the vaccine Doria wanted to force everyone in São Paulo to take. Another victory for Jair Bolsonaro.”
Those comments caused immediate anger. “163,000 dead in Brazil. And Bolsonaro says he’s won,” tweeted Flávio Dino, the leftwing governor of Maranhão state and one of the key figures in Brazil’s opposition. Speaking on Tuesday morning Dino said Bolsonaro’s “bizarre, irresponsible and ridiculous” remarks reflected the president’s ideological opposition to China and its Communist party leaders as well as his “personal hatred” of Doria. “Once more Bolsonaro has shown that he’s not worried about the lives and wellbeing of the population but simply his own ideological interests … Bolsonaro treats everything as an ideological war,” Dino, who is also seen as a potential leftwing challenger for the presidency, told the Guardian. Ciro Gomes, another prominent leftist leader, tweeted: “Prison’s not enough for scumbags who play politics with a vaccine, the only way of bringing an end to the greatest public health and socioeconomic crisis in history.” While vaccine trials are often halted to investigate suspected side-effects, including the phase 3 trial of the British Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, the language used by the Brazilian authorities was unusually strong although they provided no additional details except that the adverse event took place in late October. Clouding the issue were comments from Dimas Covas, Butantan’s director, who told Brazilian TV that the volunteer’s death was not due to the vaccine. “We found this … decision strange, because it is unrelated to the vaccine. There are more than 10,000 volunteers at this moment,” he added.
The decision to halt the programme comes just days before the first large batch of 120,000 CoronaVac shots are due to arrive in Brazil on 20 November. The rollout is now likely to be delayed. CoronaVac shot has been embroiled in political controversy in Brazil, where Bolsonaro, who has a history of minimising the threat of coronavirus, has cast doubt on its prospective effectiveness. He sparked confusion last month when he publicly rejected it, saying Brazilians would not be used as guinea pigs. Bolsonaro has often expressed mistrust of China, particularly on the campaign trail in 2018, although he has softened his rhetoric somewhat in office. Coming hard on the heels of the disclosure yesterday that the German BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine had demonstrated 90% effectiveness in its interim results, the Brazilian announcement marked the latest stumble in a global stop-start progress being watched anxiously around the world. Critics have expressed concern about what has sometimes appeared an unseemly and occasionally unethical race to get vaccines approved for use. With 170 teams working on different vaccines around the world, huge capital – including political – has been invested in getting the first successful vaccines to the market. The Chinese government’s approach to vaccines has become controversial after it had been revealed that hundreds of thousands of Chinese had already taken experimental Covid-19 vaccines as part of a state initiative to protect frontline health workers and officials travelling to high-risk nations. Critics have long warned that failure to follow proper international testing and safety protocols for potential Covid-19 vaccines risk undermining public trust and could increase public resistance to inoculation. Another Chinese vaccine candidate, produced by Sinopharm’s China National Biotec Group (CNBG) is currently in phase 3 trials in more than 10 countries, including the UAE, where it has been granted emergency use authorisation after the country’s own testing. The UAE has also been used to recruit volunteers for Russian vaccine candidates, where similar anxieties have been expressed about two Russian vaccines that were given hasty regulatory approval despite not having completed full phase 3 testing. The Russian vaccine Sputnik V – developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute in Moscow – was given the green light by Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation in August, while a second vaccine in Russia, EpiVacCorona, was also approved without entering phase 3 clinical trials. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Tuesday that all Russian vaccines against Covid-19 were effective, adding that the country would soon register a third shot against the virus.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1880,Johnson's Biden win tweet contains hidden Trump congratulations,11/10/20,"Downing Street’s congratulatory message to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on winning the US presidential election contains a hidden message congratulating Donald Trump for winning a second term in office. The message, posted on Twitter as an image a few hours after the US TV networks called the election for Biden, congratulates the president-elect on his election, and Harris “on her historic achievement”. But the image, a simple white-on-black block of text, is more than it seems. A simple colour adjustment reveals a second message hidden in the background. Above and behind the words “Joe Biden on his election”, the shadow of the words “Trump on” become faintly visible. Where the main message reads “the US is our most important ally and I look forward to working closely together”, the words “second term” appear. And below the words “shared priorities” is the phrase “on the future of this”. The message, first reported by the Guido Fawkes blog, suggests that No 10 was preparing for the possibility of congratulating Donald Trump on a re-election long after it had become clear that Joe Biden was winning the count in key battleground states. But the baffling decision to alter a pre-existing image rather than create an entirely new one, let alone to not then fully delete the original message, looks likely to create more friction between the UK government and the incoming administration. A UK government spokesperson said: “As you’d expect, two statements were prepared in advance for the outcome of this closely contested election. A technical error meant that parts of the alternative message were embedded in the background of the graphic.” The revelation comes amid a relationship already troubled by Biden’s memorable description of Johnson as the “physical and emotional clone of Donald Trump”. Even before the hidden message was revealed, Tommy Vietor, a former Obama speechwriter and podcaster viewed as a campaign surrogate for Biden, reacted to No 10’s message of congratulation with disdain. “This shapeshifting creep weighs in,” Vietor tweeted. “We will never forget your racist comments about Obama and slavish devotion to Trump but neat Instagram graphic.” The hidden message suggests No 10 was uncertain until the very end about who the winning candidate was, even as Biden’s lead in key states grew and the Trump campaign began its increasingly frantic legal efforts to frustrate the conclusion of the count. Even after the election was called on Saturday afternoon, UK government ministers continued to hedge their message. On Sunday morning, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, declined to agree with the statement “every vote should be counted in a democratic election”. “What you’re really trying to do is to drag me into the legal claims about whether or not all the votes have properly been counted,” Raab told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge. Ridge noted that it was not only Raab who had sidestepped the question: the prime minster’s own spokesperson had given a similarly evasive answer last week.

1881,Kate Bingham: well-connected but under-fire UK vaccines chief,11/10/20,"Given her background in the no-nonsense world of venture capitalism, few in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy [Beis] were surprised at Kate Bingham’s ability to make enemies as well as friends. In May, Boris Johnson appointed her as chair of the UK vaccine taskforce, the crucial body overseeing investment in coronavirus inoculations. Since then, she has infuriated colleagues by appearing to circumvent standard rules of propriety governing public appointees. This has culminated with nine days of damaging headlines after it was reported in the Sunday Times that she had successfully argued for £670,000 of public relations support and has been forced to deny claims she shared commercially sensitive information with investors. A Whitehall source said: “She is obviously very talented, she speaks her mind and gets straight to the point, but has frustrated a lot of people at the department. “She is used to doing things quickly and without bureaucratic bullshit. But she also doesn’t tell people at all times what she is up to. It means that others are having to pick up the pieces behind her.” It is unclear how Johnson came to appoint Bingham, because there was no formal process, but she is responsible for investing billions in taxpayers’ funds in Covid-19 vaccines that could offer a route out of repeated lockdowns. Her supporters point out that she has 30 years’ experience in the pharmaceutical industry, knows her brief and was brought in to do a specific job. They say she will rightly be able to claim credit for signing a deal in the summer for 30m doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine that reports say can prevent more than 90% of people from developing Covid-19. “If you think about the size of the task she took on, and her success so far, criticisms over PR contracts are a distraction,” said one senior MP. For some within the department, Bingham appears to have been given free rein without the usual demands surrounding potential conflicts of interest because she was a Johnson appointee, and because her husband is Jesse Norman MP, the financial secretary to the Treasury. Officials from the PCS union, which represents Beis staff, are planning to ask the department if the new permanent secretary, the former McKinsey consultant Sarah Munby, was involved in signing off the £670,000 PR contract with the Admiral Associates marketing agency. The consultants have already cost £490,000, with the bill expected to reach £670,000 by the end of the year. The funding came from the Treasury’s allocation for the vaccine programme’s administration budget. Bingham has brought some of the newly hired PR staff into Beis’ offices, at a time when Johnson’s key aide Dominic Cummings is cutting the number of press officers across Whitehall. “It is insensitive – her PRs are being paid very well while civil servants are facing upheaval and may be forced to move on,” a source said. The prime minister’s official spokesman said the decision to hire the PR advisers was signed off by Beis officials. Bingham, 55, was also criticised following claims that she showed a detailed list of vaccines that the UK government is closely monitoring to a “premier webinar and networking event” for women in private equity hosted by a Massachusetts company. She denied any wrongdoing, telling a joint select committee last week that reports were “inaccurate” and “irresponsible”. Asked if she had disclosed information not in the public domain to the financiers, she told MPs: “No.” The daughter of the late Lord Tom Bingham, the former lord chief justice once described as the greatest lawyer of his generation, she was educated at the independent St Paul’s girls’ school in west London with the prime minister’s sister, Rachel Johnson. Bingham later read biochemistry at Oxford, before moving on to Harvard business school. She has worked at private equity firm SV Health Investors for nearly 30 years, where she is the managing partner. Her work has led to the launch of six drugs for the treatment of patients with inflammatory and autoimmune disease and cancer. According to the government’s website, she temporarily stepped back from SV to work on the government’s vaccine plans. Prior to joining SV, Bingham worked in business development for Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a US biotechnology company, and at Monitor, a strategy consulting firm. She married Norman, who went to Eton, in 1992. They have three children.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1882,"Major's Scottish independence remarks should be 'wake-up call', says SNP",11/10/20,"A Scottish National party MP has said comments by the former prime minister John Major, who said Scots should be allowed another vote on independence provided it is followed by a confirmatory ballot, should act as a “wake-up call” for Boris Johnson. Giving a blistering summation of the “unforgivable” consequences of the Brexit vote at a Middle Temple lecture on Monday, Major warned the UK government that refusing a referendum – with polls showing a consistent majority in favour of independence for the first time – could boost the nationalist cause. The former Conservative leader suggested that Westminster could agree on the basis of two linked votes, the first to vote on the principle of negotiations, and the second on the outcome of them, adding that such a system might have delivered a different result on Brexit.
“The purpose of the second referendum would be that Scottish electors would know what they were voting for, and be able to compare it to what they now have. This did not happen with Brexit; had it done so, there may have been no Brexit,” he said. Responding to Major’s proposals, the SNP’s deputy Westminster leader, Kirsten Oswald, said: “The remarks from the former Tory prime minister must serve as a wake-up call for the current prime minister over his undemocratic stance – straight out of the Trump playbook – to attempt to deny the results of a democratic election by trying to block the people of Scotland from having the right to choose their own future in a referendum”. Last week Johnson’s Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, made clear the UK government would refuse any request for a section 30 order, which would devolve under the Scotland Act 1998 the power to hold a referendum, “for a generation”, even if a pro-independence majority was returned at next spring’s Scottish parliament elections. Asked to define a generation, Jack replied: “Is it 25 years or is it 40 years? You tell me. But it’s certainly not six years, nor 10.” SNP activists will bring an amendment to their party conference at the end of November intended to debate in public the action the party could take if a new section 30 order request is denied. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister and SNP leader, has always insisted that any future referendum must be “legal and legitimate”. The SNP MP Joanna Cherry, who brought last year’s prorogation action against the UK government, argued that it was still not clear in law whether Holyrood required the approval of Westminster before a new independence referendum could be legally held, and warned: “Scotland had her fill of Westminster gerrymandering in the 1979 devolution referendum and we are way beyond being fooled again.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1883,Man who killed 10 in Toronto van attack pleads not guilty,11/10/20,"A Canadian man who killed 10 people when he drove a van on to a crowded Toronto sidewalk has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer said he will argue he is not criminally responsible because of his state of mind at the time. Alek Minassian, 28, faces 10 counts of first-degree murder and 16 counts of attempted murder over the April 2018 attack, the worst mass murder in the city’s history. Because he has admitted to the killings, the judge-only trial will instead focus on Minassian’s state of mind at the time of the attack. “I am entering a plea of not criminally responsible for all of the counts,” Minassian said via a Zoom call on Tuesday. Minassian’s lawyer, Boris Bytensky, said he will argue his client was not criminally responsible due to a mental illness. Both the Crown and defence teams are expected to rely heavily on the testimony of medical and mental health experts. “On a warm spring afternoon on 23 April 2018, numerous pedestrians were out along Yonge enjoying the sunshine when their worlds were shattered by the actions of Mr Minassian,” the prosecution lawyer Joe Callaghan said. Reading a statement of facts that both sides agreed on, Callaghan said Minassian drove “straight at people”. “The only issue at this trial is the criminal responsibility,” Callaghan said. The prosecution showed family photographs of each of the victims’ faces as Callaghan detailed how they were struck. One of those killed was dragged for more 150 meters. Many were struck from behind. The court heard of many serious injuries, including brain damage and amputated legs. Minassian booked the rental on 4 April, weeks before the attack. “Minassian began planning the murders in advance,” Callaghan said. The Toronto-based lawyer Angela Chaisson, who has participated in a number of trials centred on criminal responsibility, said it was extremely rare for Canadian judges to determine that a defendant was not criminally responsible for their actions. “Most lay people buy into the Hollywood version, where unscrupulous people claim insanity and they get off. And it’s just not accurate,” said Chaisson. “In fact, the consequences of being found not criminally responsible can be, and often are, more severe than life in prison.”
Alongside the question of his mental state, a key element of Minassian’s trial is likely to be his association with the so-called “incel” ideology of men united by sexual frustration and a hatred of women. After his arrest in April, Minassian told police officers that he was a virgin who had never had a girlfriend, admitted to using the van as a weapon and said he wanted to inspire more attacks. Asked how he felt about the deaths, he replied: “I feel like I accomplished my mission.” Eight of the 10 killed were women. The trial, long delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic, will be streamed over Zoom. A space at the Toronto Convention Centre has been set aside for the public to follow the proceedings, which are expected to last four weeks.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1884,Nagorno-Karabakh peace deal reshapes regional geopolitics,11/10/20,"The Russian-brokered ceasefire deal in Nagorno-Karabakh will empower both Moscow and Ankara as the new kingmakers in the South Caucasus, analysts said, redrawing security guarantees between Armenia and Azerbaijan with the conspicuous absence of the west. As in the conflicts in Libya and Syria, Russia and Turkey have once again found themselves backing opposing sides, and used their sway on local players to negotiate for peace deals that guarantee their own influence. “There’s an absolutely new geopolitical configuration,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, an influential political expert close to the Kremlin.
That configuration eschews France and the United States, which along with Russia had formed the OSCE Minsk Group and hosted talks since a key 1994 ceasefire that ended a bloody war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But the OSCE Minsk Group played little role in negotiating an end to the 2020 war, as the United States had appeared distracted under President Trump, was left off of initial communiques calling for an end to the violence. Meanwhile, Turkish support for Azerbaijan helped launch a six-week offensive that had captured Shusha, a strategically-placed city in Nagorno-Karabakh, and was threatening the region’s largest city of Stepanakert until Russia stepped in with peacekeepers.
“The Minsk group basically doesn’t exist anymore,” said Lukyanov, calling Turkey an “important part of the equation”. “The military defeat of Armenia means that the previous status quo is impossible to restore. That means that the Russian role as a guarantor of stability is highly demanded by both sides.” Early on Tuesday morning, the first of nearly 2,000 Russian peacekeepers deployed toward the Lachin corridor, a lifeline between mainland Armenia and Stepanakert, the largest city in Nagorno-Karabakh. Under the accord announced signed by Armenia and Azerbaijan, Russian troops will guard the corridor for five years. The future for Stepanakert looks dim, said Laurence Broers, the Caucasus programme director at Conciliation Resources, a peace-building group, adding that “maybe the calculation is that it’s going to be such an awful place to live that most of the Armenian population – most of whom have already left – won’t come back”. The mission is arguably Russia’s greatest intervention into the region since the 2008 Georgia war. Russia had resisted a peacekeeping role for weeks until it became clear that Azerbaijan was threatening to capture the whole of Nagorno-Karabakh. “The idea was to let the Azeris win but not completely,” said Lukyanov. Under the agreement, Azerbaijan will retain control of the land it has captured during the war and retake territories outside of Nagorno-Karabakh under Armenian control. Already on Tuesday there were signs of both sides jockeying to spin the peace deal. The Azerbaijan president, Ilham Aliyev, said that both Russian and Turkish peacekeepers would be deployed to Nagorno-Karabakh, shocking many Armenians. Russia quickly intervened, highlighting that Turkey was not an official partner to the peace agreement. “Not a single word is said about this in the published statement,” Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The sides did not agree on that. The presence of Turkish soldiers in Karabakh was not coordinated.” Turkey’s influence on the conflict has been well documented, as Ankara sold crucial drone technology to Azerbaijan, and Turkish security firms contracted with rebel fighters from Idlib to travel to Azerbaijan and fight on the front lines of the conflict.
And the opening of a direct link between Azerbaijan and its exclave of Nakhchivan, which borders Turkey, would create a land route from Turkey to mainland Azerbaijan. All eyes will now be on the Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh, who are the key to maintaining a fragile ceasefire. Broers said that the Russian peacekeepers could “look like a colonising force”. “To go into a peacekeeping operation without a political process that could deliver a peace agreement basically means you’re there for good,” he said. “What’s been created now is an inherently unstable situation. That peacekeeping contingent will be vulnerable to provocations.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1885,Nearly one in five Covid patients later diagnosed with mental illness – study,11/10/20,"Nearly one in five people who have had Covid-19 are diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder such as anxiety, depression or insomnia within three months of testing positive for the virus, according to a study that suggests action is needed to mitigate the mental health toll of the pandemic. The analysis – conducted by researchers from the University of Oxford and NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre – also found that people with a pre-existing mental health diagnosis were 65% more likely to be diagnosed with Covid-19 than those without, even accounting for known risk factors such as age, sex, race, and underlying physical conditions. “This finding was unexpected and needs investigation. In the meantime, having a psychiatric disorder should be added to the list of risk factors for Covid-19,” said Dr Max Taquet, an NIHR academic clinical fellow and one of the authors of the analysis.
The calculations were made on the basis of roughly 70m US health records, including more than 62,000 cases of Covid-19 that did not require a hospital stay or an emergency department visit. The incidence of any diagnosis of mental ill-health in the 14 to 90 days after a Covid-19 diagnosis was 18.1%, including 5.8% that were a first diagnosis. In order to examine whether the excess risk was directly associated with Covid-19, the researchers compared data with six other conditions over the same period: influenza; other respiratory tract infections; a skin infection; gallstones; urinary tract stones; and the fracture of a large bone. In the three months after Covid-19 diagnosis, 5.8% of patients had their first recorded diagnosis of psychiatric illness, compared with 2.5% to 3.4% of patients in the comparison cohorts – almost a doubling in risk, according to the paper published in the journal Lancet Psychiatry. Paul Harrison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford, said more research was needed to establish whether a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder could be directly linked to getting coronavirus. General factors that influence physical health were not captured in the records analysed, such as socio-economic background, smoking, or use of drugs. There was also potential that the general stressful environment of the pandemic is playing a role, he noted. Research suggests that people from poorer socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to suffer mental ill-health. Poverty also increases exposure to coronavirus, owing to factors like crowded housing and unsafe working conditions. “Equally, it’s not at all implausible that Covid-19 might have some direct effect on your brain and your mental health. But I think that, again, remains to be positively demonstrated,” said Harrison. A particularly concerning finding was the doubling of the diagnosis of dementia – which is typically irreversible – three months after testing positive for Covid-19, versus the other health conditions. It may be that coming to a hospital or to see your doctor to get diagnosed with Covid-19 allows for other pre-existing conditions – such as dementia – to be diagnosed, noted Harrison. “Having said that … it’s not at all unlikely that there may also be a brain effect of the virus in certain people that is going to cause certain more neurological symptoms and difficulties,” he said. “So, we’re particularly careful in not over-interpreting that association.” Studies researching the impact of the virus on the brain and the central nervous system are under way, including one by scientists in the UK who have formed a partnership to explore the neurological and neuropsychiatric complications of Covid-19. In July, neurologists published details of more than 40 UK Covid-19 patients whose complications ranged from brain inflammation and delirium to nerve damage and stroke. Only time will tell whether the incidence of psychiatric illness post-Covid-19 continue to rise or persist beyond the three-month period, the researchers added. “It’s difficult to judge the importance of these findings … it may be unsurprising that this happens a bit more often in people with Covid-19, who may understandably have been worried that they might become seriously unwell and who will also have had to endure a period of isolation,” said David Curtis, an honorary professor at University College London and Queen Mary University of London, who was not involved in the study. “Overall, the results reported seem broadly plausible, but I’m not sure that they have specific implications for patients or health services.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1886,New Zealand bird of the year: adult toy store endorses 'polyamorous' hihi,11/10/20,"The competition to elect New Zealand’s bird of the year has intensified with a vote-rigging scandal and an adult toy store endorsing a small, polyamorous bird with unusually large testes. The annual competition, which began 15 years ago to draw attention to native birds, many of which are endangered, has grown into a national obsession. Different types of birds have their own campaign managers and the competition is so fierce that this year has seen record early voting – with 40,000 ballots cast so far and five days still remaining The poll’s success has attracted commercial interests, such as the endorsement this week by Adult Toy Megastore of the hihi, a “polyamorous, sexually fluid bird with big testicles”.
The hihi, or stitchbird, is the only bird in the world to mate face to face, according to a statement released by Adult Toy Megastore as part of its campaign endorsement. “We are proud to endorse the hihi for bird of the year 2020. Hihi lead the sex positivity movement among songbirds and for that we salute them and say to you: VOTE HIHI. “Male and female hihi practice consensual polyamory [the practice of intimate relationships with more than one partner, with the informed consent of all partners] which is rare. “Male hihi have testicles four times larger than they should be making them, by size, the largest testicles on a bird in the world!… How could you not vote for them?” Claims of consensual polyamory, however, were contradicted by a 2004 university thesis which found “male stitchbirds seem to be able to bypass female choice through adopting a face to face forced copulation position”.
Massey University zoologist, Isabel Castro, who studied hihi mating systems, found they had a reproductive flexibility with few peers among perching birds. They can be found in conventional pairings or in breeding groups, Castro told NZ Geographic magazine. The group might consist of one male and several females, or in some cases one female may have several males in attendance. Hihi are the third member, after the tui and bellbird, of the local branch of the honeyeater family. It has come perilously close to extinction in the past and is currently classified by bird of the year organisers as “in some trouble”. The bird of the year competition is no stranger to skullduggery, with organisers announcing on Tuesday they had discovered more than 1,500 fraudulent votes for the Kiwi pukupuku, or little-spotted kiwi, cast in the dead of Monday night.
“It’s lucky we spotted this little kiwi trying to sneak in an extra 1,500 votes under the cover of darkness!” said Laura Keown, spokesperson for bird of the year. “All of our birds deserve a fighting chance, especially this little manu, our smallest kiwi, which is so threatened by predators that it is extinct on mainland New Zealand outside of predator-free sanctuaries.” The kiwi pukupuku campaign manager, Emma Rawson, said voter fraud was not the Kiwi way. “As Aotearoa’s national emblem, the little-spotted kiwi represents New Zealanders’ values of democracy, fairness, equality, and honesty.” The competition has made household names of many of the country’s feathered characters: the kea, or alpine thief, the kereru, or large drunkard, and now it seems it could be the “horny” hihi, one of New Zealand’s rarest birds.
Prominent voters in the competition include former premier, Helen Clark (a fan of the hoiho/ yellow-eyed penguin), and current prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, who is said to again be backing the black petrel or “the bogan bird” as she refers to it because it dresses in black. Early voting has the toroa (Antipodean albatross) and the kakapo, a heavy flightless parrot, leading the field with the final result unlikely to be known until the competition’s complex preferential voting system is worked through. • This story was amended on 11 November 2020 to make clear that birds have internal testes.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1887,NHS test and trace: Dido Harding says scheme failed to predict demand,11/10/20,"The head of the NHS’s test and trace programme has acknowledged it failed to predict the scale of demand for coronavirus testing as schools and universities returned this autumn. Appearing at a joint meeting of the health and social care committee and science and technology committee, Dido Harding said that the demand for testing in September took the service by surprise. “As schools came back we saw demand significantly outstrip [the] planned capacity delivery,” she said, adding a similar surge in demand was seen in Scotland. “None of us were able to predict that in advance,” she said. Challenged by Carol Monaghan, the MP for Glasgow, as to how it was possible that such a surge had not been predicted, Lady Harding said: “The reality is that we are all learning about Covid, we are learning about how the disease behaves and we are learning about how all of us as human beings and a society behave, and we are seeing that learning happening in real time across the whole world.” Harding later said the system had expected some increase in demand, and had been building capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. “With the benefit of hindsight the balance between the supply and the demand forecast wasn’t right. Clearly that is true,” she said. Asked when the next major surge in demand for testing was anticipated, Harding replied it was not her place to answer and that it was not an operational issue. “I defer to the clinical experts in that, rather than think that it is my job to know the answer to that question,” she said. Graham Stringer, the MP for Blackley and Broughton, responded: “You are the executive chair of the National Institute of Health Protection, I would have expected you to have asked that question [about future demand] of professionals before and have an answer for this committee.” Stringer said he was “surprised and shocked” at Harding’s failure to answer not only that question, but queries about the proportion of funding that was spent on local versus national test-and-trace efforts. “That is the crux of the debate about test and trace, whether doing things locally is more effective than centrally,” he said.
Harding was also unable to say how long it was taking for the contacts of someone who had requested a test, and subsequently tested positive, to be told to self-isolate. The government scientific advisory body Sage has previously said this period was crucial for test and trace to reduce the R number – the number of people each person with the virus infects. “I can’t give you a complete end to end average at this stage,” Harding said. “Clearly we have lots of work to do to get to the majority of people being tested and contacted within 72 hours, but we are reaching a meaningful proportion of that.” Anyone wishing to get a test was now able to do so, although she was later forced to clarify that testing was only available for those with symptoms of Covid-19. “As we stand now, testing is completely unconstrained across all four nations, anyone who wants to get a test anywhere across the country can get one today,” she said, adding that the average distance people now had to travel in England was, on average, less than three miles. “This is a retail network that didn’t exist six months ago, that is now larger that the whole of Asda’s food business.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1888,"No need for border checks on Northern Ireland supermarket food, Foster tells EU",11/10/20,"Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland’s first minister has written to the EU urging it to think twice about risking daily food supplies to local supermarkets with mandatory Brexit health checks from 1 January. J Sainsbury and Marks & Spencer have warned that certain lines of meat, fish and dairy products may be restricted because of the checks that will be imposed on food and animals entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain from 1 January. The DUP leader and Michelle O’Neill, the deputy first minster, said they have “urgently asked the EU to consider the serious implications and impact on our essential food and produce supply chains”. They argue it is “simply not credible” to impose health checks at ports on “goods [that] are sterling packaged by well established companies”, which pose “zero risk that they would use a backdoor” into Ireland and thereby the single market.
In a recent memo on the state of the Brexit talks, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned that he does not want a “food scandal there in a few years”, suggesting the EU has yet to agree to waive checks on supermarket suppliers. The EU is concerned over the possibility of infections or outbreaks of diseases such as salmonella crossing the invisible border with the Republic of Ireland if it does not have rigorous checks at the ports and airports in Northern Ireland. The exact nature of these checks is still being discussed at the EU-UK joint committee tasked with implementing Brexit and chaired by Michael Gove and Maroš Šefčovič, the vice-president of the European commission. The confidential update on talks suggests Gove and Šefčovič have yet to agree on the frequency of the checks and the requirement that every product coming in from Great Britain has a health certificate. Last week Sainsbury’s chief executive, Simon Roberts, said the trade needed something akin to a “trusted trader status” to help the free flow of goods. “Customers expect to have access to a full range but [it] won’t be possible to make that available unless something changes.” In a statement Foster said: “It is simply not credible nor in good faith with what the EU committed to on NI to maintain a position that well established supermarket chains such as Iceland, M&S, Tesco or Sainsbury’s cannot be trusted to send goods to NI for circulation in NI.
“It is simply not reasonable for the EU to insist these goods are treated as ‘at risk’ putting food and produce supplies to NI on 1st Jan at risk.” EU representatives said they had received the letter from Foster and O’Neill and were aware of the issues facing supermarkets. The health check rules “are there to protect the health and safety of consumers in the single market, including consumers in Northern Ireland. We are aware, of course, of the concerns raised regarding supermarkets and the import of food products into Northern Ireland”.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1889,Peru's new president accused of coup after ousting of predecessor,11/10/20,"The head of Peru’s Congress has been sworn as president after his predecessor was controversially ousted in a congressional vote late on Monday, prompting accusations of a coup. The removal of the popular president Martín Vizcarra comes as Peru is reeling from one of the world’s worst coronavirus outbreaks, which has left its economy in recession and caused mass unemployment. After a night of furious protests and clashes with police, hundreds of demonstrators gathered again on Tuesday morning in downtown Lima to protest against the swearing-in of Manuel Merino, widely viewed as a key figure in orchestrating Vizcarra’s impeachment. A previous attempt in September failed to get enough votes. Riot police with shields and wielding batons beat back demonstrators marching on the Congress building who waved Peruvian flags and placards reading “Merino is not my president”. In total 105 out of Peru’s 130 lawmakers voted to remove Vizcarra on Monday. Vizcarra has previously said that no fewer than 68 of the members of congress seeking his impeachment were themselves subject to ongoing legal processes. Many public figures and legal experts have said described Vizcarra’s ousting – on the grounds of “permanent moral incapacity” – as illegitimate. George Forsyth, the leading presidential candidate, tweeted it was a “coup in disguise”. Leftwing presidential candidate Veronika Mendoza called for Peruvians to take to the streets to defend democracy. Analysts concurred that the removal was orchestrated by opposition leaders who bitterly opposed the president’s anti-graft reforms and his overhaul of higher education which affected their business interests. “The removal of President Martín Vizcarra is a coup d’etat,” said Pedro Cateriano, a former prime minister and constitutional lawyer. “Without any doubt, the Congress has violated the constitutional order,” he said, adding: “The constitution does not allow a sitting president to be accused or politically penalized.” “A Peruvian president can be investigated and accused when he finishes his mandate, just as it happened with [former presidents] [Alejandro] Toledo, [Alan] García, [Ollanta] Humala and PPK [Pedro Pablo Kuczynski].” Vizcarra, who left the presidential palace on Monday night, was applauded by neighbours as he arrived at his home in a middle-class district of Lima. The leader, who had long campaigned against corruption at the highest levels of government, said he was leaving office with a “clear conscience”. Flanked by his ministers, Vizcarra said he hoped to find out what were the “real motives” behind his impeachment. “Were they decisions made in favour of … Peru and Peruvians or were they decisions made only for personal and group interests?” he asked. Merino takes office under a cloud of illegitimacy and a dearth of public support while most polls show Vizcarra still has more than 50% approval.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1890,Pfizer Covid vaccine: what has the trial found and is this a breakthrough?,11/10/20,"What’s happened – is this a breakthrough? Pfizer and the German biotech company BioNTech said on Monday that they had had encouraging early results from a phase 3 clinical trial of their coronavirus vaccine. The trial is assessing how well the vaccine works in preventing humans from becoming infected. Although details are scant, the news is positive. What are the new results? Pfizer and BioNTech say they looked at 94 cases of coronavirus that occurred among participants after they had received two shots of either the vaccine or the placebo, and found that the vaccine was more than 90% effective at seven days after the second dose. As the two doses are spaced by three weeks, the team behind the vaccine say their results suggest protection is achieved 28 days after the initiation of the vaccination.
They also found no signs of safety concerns, and stressed that the participants were from diverse backgrounds – an important consideration given that black and ethnic minority groups appear to be at greater risk from the virus. Regulators have previously said they would give the green light to a vaccine that has at least a 50% effectiveness rate, a bar this vaccine looks on course to exceed. How does this vaccine work? The vaccine in question is based on genetic material called mRNA that enables the production of the “spike proteins” that sit on the outside of the coronavirus. The vaccine introduces this mRNA to the human body, triggering human cells to produce the spike protein. In response to these proteins, the body produces antibodies, and other immune pathways are activated, guarding against infection. How excited should we be? Most experts agree that the results are exciting and excellent news, but the optimism should come with a note of caution: the results are preliminary, have been shared only by press release, and the trials are not yet complete.
So far, 38,955 people have received two doses of the vaccine, and the team plan a further analysis of the results once a total of 164 confirmed Covid-19 cases have occurred among the participants. They will also follow participants for two years post-vaccination to explore long-term safety and whether it continues to provide protection. There are certainly still many questions that need to be answered, including how long protection via the vaccine might last, whether it protects those who have previously had coronavirus, and whether it prevents people from catching the virus and passing it on or simply reduces the severity of symptoms. There are also logistical challenges, not least as the vaccine needs to be stored at -80C, meaning that even in developed countries there could be difficulties in distributing the jab. However, the results so far are very encouraging. What’s more, if successful, the vaccine would be the first licensed jab to be based on mRNA, a development that could fuel the emergence of new vaccines for other diseases. It would also set a record for the shortest time taken to develop an effective vaccine from scratch. How soon could it be available in the UK and globally? There is some way to go before the vaccine will be available, as it must be approved by licensing authorities. Pfizer has said it plans to apply to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency approval as soon as safety data allows, possibly as soon as the third week of November. In the UK, Boris Johnson’s spokesman has said the UK has secured 40m doses of the vaccine, 10m of which are due to be available before the end of the year assuming no snags. But the logistical requirements mentioned above, such as cold storage, mean there could be problems rolling out the vaccine in countries with poorer health infrastructure or where electricity supply is unreliable, or in some rural areas. In addition, while demand has been anticipated, a huge level of production will be required, and then there is the matter of who gets the vaccine first and how mass vaccination would be rolled out. And what about the other vaccines – is Oxford far behind? There are more than 170 vaccines in development, 11 of which are in phase 3 efficacy trials – including an mRNA vaccine from the US company Moderna, and the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine. The latter uses a different strategy to the Pfizer/BioNTech approach, delivering the gene for the spike protein to human cells via a chimpanzee cold virus that has been changed so it cannot grow and cause an infection. The results from this vaccine trial are expected in a matter of weeks.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1891,PR firm hired by UK vaccine tsar linked to Dominic Cummings’ father-in-law,11/10/20,"The UK’s vaccine tsar is to pay almost £700,000 in taxpayers’ money on a team of boutique PR consultants whose secretary is a long-time business associate of Dominic Cummings’ father-in-law. Over the weekend, it was reported that Kate Bingham, the head of the vaccine taskforce, who reports directly to the prime minister, was to spend more than £670,000 hiring PR consultants from a firm called Admiral Associates. The owner and founding managing director of Admiral Associates is listed in companies house as Georgie Cameron, whose husband Angus Collingwood-Cameron is also listed as secretary. He is also a park manager for Chillingham Castle Wild Cattle Association, and a director since 2004 along with Humphry Wakefield, father-in-law of Cummings.
Eight of Cameron’s freelance consultants are overseeing Bingham’s media strategy. There has been growing disquiet after it was claimed Bingham disclosed confidential data about government investment priorities to US financiers before it emerged that she could personally profit from the launch of an investment fund bankrolled by UK taxpayers. Appearing before a joint select committee hearing last week, Bingham denied any wrongdoing and described the report as “nonsense”, “inaccurate” and “irresponsible”. On its LinkedIn page, in the only post during the last five months, Admiral Associates appeared to announce it was hiring for the roles to support the UK pandemic response and that they required people skilled in crisis communications. It said experience of working with or within a healthcare or research setting and/or a government department was an advantage and that remuneration would be “excellent for the right candidates”. The overarching company last year reported tangible assets of £2,884 and total equity of £194,065. The company filing said: “The director of the company has elected not to include a copy of the profit and loss account within the financial statements.” The association between Wakefield and the PR company is likely to reignite accusations of a so-called “chumocracy” at the centre of British politics after a number of contracts amid the coronavirus crisis were awarded to allies of the prime minister’s chief of staff without tender. Rachel Reeves, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “These revelations raise yet more serious questions about how taxpayer money is being spent during the pandemic and how government is being run. “The public deserve urgent answers as to how a small PR agency with close links to the PM’s closest adviser was simply gifted such a large contract – and what exactly was delivered for such a price tag. “We know Dominic Cummings doesn’t think the rules apply to him, but this is no way to treat taxpayer money. The prime minister must be transparent about the processes he has put in place to allow such potential breaches of public trust.” According to the Sunday Times, £500,000 has already been spent on the team, which is contracted until the end of the year, suggesting each consultant is on the equivalent of £167,000 a year. There was not been an open procurement process but this is not unusual practice in some circumstances. Bingham, who is married to the Conservative minister Jesse Norman, is herself in a temporary role and had always been expected to step down later this year. The role was not advertised and it has been reported she may have been headhunted by Johnson, from whom she won praise for her work on procuring coronavirus vaccines. It was reported those assisting Bingham, who reports directly to the PM, are helping her prepare for media appearances, drafting statements and overseeing a vaccines podcast on Spotify, which has broadcast eight episodes since August. The preamble for one episode reads: “Developing a vaccine is one thing, but manufacturing it in very large amounts is a significant challenge in itself.” Another episode discusses how to reassure people who may be reluctant to take a vaccine. The apparent PR push comes as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on Tuesday he had asked the NHS to get ready for a rollout of the vaccine as soon as next month. The Collingwood-Camerons and Admiral Associates did not return requests for comment. A No 10 spokesperson said: “It is ridiculous to make such an imaginary and tenuous link. Dominic Cummings has never heard of Georgina or Angus Cameron. “Specialist communications support was procured by the Vaccine Taskforce in line with proper practice.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1892,"Saeb Erekat, veteran Palestinian peace negotiator, dies after Covid diagnosis",11/10/20,"Saeb Erekat, the veteran Palestinian peace negotiator and one of the most high-profile figures in its leadership since the early 1990s, has died after contracting coronavirus. Erekat, a lawmaker from Jericho in the occupied West Bank, was a senior adviser to the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and also worked for Abbas’s predecessor, Yasser Arafat. He served as the secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Unrelenting in his indignation against Israeli control over Palestinian life, the US-educated former journalist and academic was well-known to three decades of diplomatic and media circles for his condemnation of what he eventually described as apartheid, delivering his criticism in his trademark staccato voice. The 65-year-old underwent a lung transplant in the US in 2017 and had been in poor health since. On 8 October, he announced he had been diagnosed with Covid-19 and later said he was experiencing “difficult symptoms”. After being transferred to Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem, doctors said his condition deteriorated to become critical, and he was placed on a ventilator. On Tuesday one of his senior aides announced that he had died. Having studied politics in the US and peace studies in the UK, Erekat was a key player pushing for the two-state solution doctrine, under which the country of Palestine would be created alongside Israel. In early peace negotiations, he wore a black-and-white checked keffiyeh scarf as a symbol of the Palestinian nation he envisioned. Several officials from across the spectrum, including Israeli politicians, commemorated his life. Tzipi Livni, the former Israeli foreign minister who had sat on the opposite side of the table to Erekat, said she was saddened by his death. “Saeb dedicated his life to his people,” she wrote on Twitter. “Being sick, he texted me: ‘I’m not finished with what I was born to do’. My deepest condolences to the Palestinians and his family. He will be missed.” “I’m not finished with what I was born to do,” he recently messaged Tzipi Livni, the former Israeli foreign minister and one of his main negotiating partners. “I overcame a lung transplant, and I’ll defeat this Covid.” Erekat witnessed the teasing beginnings of that aspiration materialise. In 1994, his home town of Jericho was handed over from Israeli troops to Palestinian forces in what was expected to be the first stages of an eventual deal. “It is a partly joyous feeling, but I also believe we have only begun,” he told the Guardian in May 1994. “It is a time to plan, to work hard and to tighten our belts. We cannot afford to fail.” Three years later, Erekat was more pessimistic, telling the Los Angeles Times that Israel’s new hardline prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, considered the peace accords signed by his predecessor as a “poison dagger in his heart. He must pull it out”. “I think Netanyahu’s ultimate goal is to get his tanks rolling into the Palestinian areas,” Erekat told the paper. “To be honest with you, I think the worst is coming.” What followed was the bloody Second Intifada, several failed attempts to resuscitate the peace agreement and Israel’s increasingly permanent grip over the occupied West Bank, something Erekat referred to as the “colonial-settler occupation”. Palestinians living there now reside in semi-enclaves – urban areas with some form of autonomy but ultimately with their lives dominated by Israeli forces. Despite being in his mid-60s, Erekat was a younger member of Abbas’s senior leadership team, which has been criticised by Palestinians for being undemocratic and failing to drive real change. During Erekat’s final years, Netanyahu, encouraged by Donald Trump, declared his intention to annex huge swaths of the West Bank, a move seen as the death blow to the two-state ideal. After Trump recognised the contested city of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017, Erekat said the message was clear: “The two-state solution is over. Now is the time to transform the struggle for one state with equal rights for everyone living in historic Palestine.” Despite his continued pessimism, Erekat remained a prolific voice, including for the two-state solution, holding regular conferences with reporters in Jericho. During one of his last meetings, in May, the politician warned that Israeli aspirations to annex land would lead future generations of Palestinians to abandon the idea of a negotiated solution. “I’m one of the ones who promised Palestinians, that once we recognise Israel, once we renounce violence, once we accept the two-state solution, once we negotiate, then we can have our independence,” he said. “Who will be the Palestinian in the next 1,000 years looking at my experience and what we’ve done, who will be willing to sit with the Israelis at the table?”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1893,Saudi Arabia considers clemency for female activists ahead of G20,11/10/20,"Saudi Arabia is considering clemency for jailed female activists ahead of its hosting of the G20 summit this month, the Saudi ambassador to the UK has said. The kingdom has been under growing pressure on its human rights record ahead of the summit, which is to be held virtually on 21 and 22 November. This includes the fate of a group of women who were prominent in the campaign for the right to drive. One of the themes of the G20 is women’s empowerment. Speaking to the Guardian, Khalid bin Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud said the women had been detained for reasons other than seeking the right to drive, but that a debate was under way in the foreign ministry about whether their continued detention was causing Saudi Arabia so much political damage that it was not worthwhile. It is rare for senior diplomats to give an insight into internal debates within the often secretive court. “The G20, does it offer an opportunity for clemency? Possibly. That is a judgment for someone other than me,” he said. “People ask: is it worth the damage it is causing you, whatever they did? That is a fair argument to make and it is a discussion we have back at home within our political system and within our ministry.
“There is a variety of views. Some people say it doesn’t matter what other people think of us, what is important is to do what is right for our country, and if people knowingly break our laws they should be punished according to those laws. Other people say it isn’t worth it, let them out, let them live their lives and ignore them.” One of the jailed women, Loujain al-Hathloul has been on hunger strike in Al-Hayer high security prison since 26 October in protest at her conditions there. A UN women’s rights committee expressed alarm last week at her deteriorating health. Hathloul was arrested with nine other women’s rights advocates in May 2018, months before women were finally granted the right to drive. Her family, including her sister, claim she has been tortured. At least five of those arrested remain in jail. The ambassador said there was merit in the arguments both for and against clemency.“We are definitely moving in a different direction, but we are not a western nation and people need to understand that some of our beliefs are different,” he said. Hathloul’s sister Lina dismissed the ambassador’s remarks, saying: “This is simply a PR stunt, again. Loujain and most of the jailed Saudi activists have not been convicted. ⁦It’s been nearly three years and they are still arbitrarily and illegally detained.” The ambassador also said he hoped the G20 meeting would adopt a long-term programme of post-Covid debt relief for the world’s poorest countries.
Saudi Arabia has also been hit by Covid’s impact on economic activity and the fall in the oil price and private sector investment. The government’s budget deficit is predicted to widen to 12.8% of GDP this year from 4.5% in 2019, and Saudi officials acknowledge privately that the government’s image has been a factor in the drop in investment. The death of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018, led to international outrage over what the CIA and other western intelligence agencies concluded was an assassination ordered by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Riyadh said Saudi agents had killed him in a botched extradition operation. The G20 meeting had been intended as a showcase for a modernising and open Saudi Arabia as world leaders arrived in Riyadh, but will now be a virtual summit and may not last the two days allocated. It will also be one of the last international set-pieces for Donald Trump, a close ally of Prince Mohammed. The Saudi government sent a message of congratulations to Joe Biden on Sunday. The US president-elect has promised to review US-Saudi relations, including Washington’s support for the Saudi intervention in Yemen. US dependence on Saudi oil has fallen markedly as a result of domestic shale gas production, but the kingdom’s political stability is still a key US concern. “Our GDP is linked to the price of oil,” the ambassador said. “If oil prices were high we would be less inclined to embrace reform of our economy, [but] oil is on its way out either because it is finite, or due to climate change “We are trying to develop economies that are not so reliant on oil. We have got to try because if Saudi Arabia collapses economically it collapses politically, and that is a bigger disaster than most people are aware of.” Saudi ambitions for a debt package for low-income countries may be dashed by the virtual format and disagreements between G20 members, primarily China and the EU, over the length of the commitment. The ambassador said: “We will sadly miss that opportunity for two leaders to pull each other aside and have a quick chat. It may make the communique a bit less specific than we would like. It may have to be more pre-agreed than normal.” • This article was amended on 10 November 2020 because jailed female activists were incorrectly described as having been found guilty by the courts.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1894,Save our fries: frozen chips from EU threaten to wedge New Zealand farmers,11/10/20,"European nations hammered by multiple lockdowns are dumping tonnes of frozen fries into the southern hemisphere, prompting the New Zealand government to open a formal investigation. New Zealand had a seven-week lockdown in March and April but since then has largely returned to normal, with the hospitality sector back up and running. The producers’ body Potato New Zealand said countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium had “deliberately targeted” the New Zealand market with their discounted frozen fries as the market for them had largely dried up in Europe due to coronavirus lockdowns.
Exports of frozen fries from the EU to New Zealand increased by 50% in June and the boss of Potato NZ, Chris Claridge, said the cheap fries were putting the livelihoods of his members in jeopardy. A campaign to buy local fries has kicked off under the hashtag #saveourfries, and Claridge said consumers needed to start questioning the origins of their food if they wanted New Zealand growers to survive. “We believe there has been a huge surge in volume coming to New Zealand and at discounted prices – which qualifies as dumping and will cause significant harm to our domestic industry.” New Zealand is the first country to undertake a formal investigation, though the US and Australia have also called for duties or actions to limit what they see as under-priced EU fries. The South African Vegetable Processors Forum is lobbying its government to take anti-dumping measures against EU exports.
Adam Dubas, of the ministry of business, innovation and employment, said the investigation into dumping could take up to six months. Dubas said provisional anti-dumping duties might be imposed to prevent injury occurring to local growers during the period of investigation. New Zealand wine and speciality cheese producers have also started to raise concerns at dumping of cheap European product as consumers tighten their purse strings. The New Zealand potato industry is worth more than $NZ1bn per annum and until now 85% of the fries consumed in New Zealand have been produced by local growers. “Our hospitality sector is still alive, it’s still functioning, we’re not in lockdown, so we believe we’re being targeted because our economy is still viable and operating,” Claridge said. “So what we would like people in New Zealand to ask is: where are my fries from? The New Zealand agriculture sector needs to be supported.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1895,South Africa issues arrest warrant for ANC's Ace Magashule,11/10/20,"South African prosecutors issued an arrest warrant on Monday for Ace Magashule, one of the most powerful politicians in the troubled country and a key figure in the ruling African National Congress. The move appeared to signal a new will by authorities to move against alleged corruption, and is likely to be welcomed by Cyril Ramaphosa, the president, who is under pressure for failing to tackle the problem since taking power almost three years ago. The warrant has been issued in relation to Magashule’s alleged role in a $15m contract to find and remove asbestos from homes in disadvantaged neighbourhoods in the Free State province. Magashule is the secretary general of the ANC and so in charge of the day-to-day running of the party that has governed South Africa since the end of the repressive, racist apartheid regime in 1994. He was premier of Free State province from 2009 to 2018, and so at the time of the alleged corruption. On Tuesday the 61-year-old politician said he was “ready for anything” and claimed that the “enemy” had infiltrated the governing party. “I have not done anything wrong … I am a law abiding citizen,” Magashule told journalists while campaigning in the Soweto township for upcoming by-elections. Analysts described the arrest warrant as significant. “He is a very powerful individual and there have been allegations of corruption swirling about him for years. It is an important moment for the rule of law, and … sends a powerful message,” said Judith February, an expert in governance and commentator. A statement from the ANC said only that the party would be “monitoring developments”. Though Ramaphosa is not thought to have intervened in the move to prosecute Magashule, the arrest of a major political rival will be a welcome boost for the president’s continuing efforts to impose his will on the bitterly divided ruling party. “There are no heroes here. This should have happened a long time ago. But Ramaphosa will be happy. It plays into his anti-corruption agenda,” said Ralph Mathekga, an author and analyst. Ramaphosa, a labour activist turned wealthy tycoon, is seen as the leader of the ANC’s moderate and reformist wing, while Magashule is the political heir of former president Jacob Zuma, who represents a more radical wing committed to a sharp redistribution of wealth in South Africa. Zuma was forced to resign in 2017 amid allegations of systematic corruption and mismanagement. “Within the ANC the tensions remain and Ramaphosa remains leader of the party, so any celebration will be very quiet. He is well aware that the consequences of any arrest of Magashule for the party are very unpredictable,” said Mathekga. Derek Hanekom, a former ANC minister and leading Ramaphosa loyalist, said prosecutors were “doing exactly what the constitution demands [and] applying the law without fear or favour.” “No one is above the law. Innocence can be established in court. Or guilt. But a fair hearing is guaranteed,” Hanekom said. Public outrage has been building for years but was fuelled in recent months by a series of scandals involving massive sums corruptly earned on government contracts for emergency supplies to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and grants to support the most needy. There have also been a series of revelations about systematic corruption in major government utilities and ministries at the televised hearings of a judicial inquiry. In June, Ramaphosa ordered that evidence presented at the inquiry could be used by prosecutors, potentially opening up hundreds of cases for further action. “There is a lot of evidence in the public domain, and that makes the arrest feel perfectly legitimate. The ANC is rotten but hopefully this is the start of a clean up. But it will take a very long time,” said February. In August, Ramaphosa said ANC officials must take leave from their positions if charged with corruption, and resign if convicted. However the policy has not so far been applied by the party. Magashule is scheduled to appear before magistrates in Bloemfontein, the capital of Free State province, on Friday. Although the country has been widely praised for its response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the crisis has dealt a heavy blow to South Africa’s flagging economy, exacerbating soaring unemployment, undermining public finances and derailing infrastructure projects.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1896,Spanish statue bodge-up is a new rival to Borja's Monkey Christ,11/10/20,"In the footsteps of the unintentionally iconic Monkey Christ, the Tintin St George, the near-fluorescent Virgin and Child– not to mention the less than sinlessly executed Immaculate Conception – comes … well, it’s hard to say. The latest Spanish restoration effort to provoke anguished headlines and much social media snarking is, or rather, was, a carved figure adorning an ornate, early 20th-century building in the north-western city of Palencia. What was once the smiling face of a woman next to some livestock has been replaced with a crude countenance that bears a passing resemblance to the incumbent US president, Donald Trump. Or one of the Sand People from Star Wars. Or something from a cheese-induced nightmare. Or, to be honest, pretty much anything you wish to project on to it. The bodged restoration came to light after an artist placed pictures of the offending visage on Facebook on Saturday. “The pictures are a bit blurry, but you can see the prank perfectly well,” said Antonio Guzmán Capel. “It looks like the head of a cartoon character.”
Palencia, he added ruefully, now had an attraction to rival the Monkey Christ that propelled the town of Borja to global fame eight years ago after a devout parishioner took it upon herself to restore Elías García Martínez’s Ecce Homo before it flaked and faded into oblivion. “I’m sure whoever did it got paid for it,” said Guzmán. “But the bigger crime was committed by the person who commissioned it and then tried to carry on as though nothing was wrong.” Palencia’s reaction may be one of shock and anger for now, but the authorities in Borja managed to find a way to turn the great Monkey Christ fiasco of 2012 to their advantage. That year, almost 50,000 people visited the small church where the Ecce Homo is displayed behind a protective screen. Thousands still visit the church every year and a small museum has sprung up where people can buy Ecce Homo key rings, T-shirts, teddy bears and mugs. As well as employing two caretakers, the church-museum also yields revenue that is used to help fund places at Borja’s care home for the elderly. But for restoration experts in Spain, the latest bodged job is another example of the need for proper training, protection and investment. “THIS #IsNotARestoration,” Spain’s Professional Association of Restorers and Conservators said in a tweet, adding, perhaps a little unnecessarily: “It’s NOT a professional intervention.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1897,"Tehran curfew unlikely to halt Iran's Covid spread, experts warn",11/10/20,"A new nightly curfew for business in Tehran to slow the spread of Covid-19 is unlikely to be sufficient as daily new infections in Iran topped 10,000 for the second day in a row, experts warned. On Tuesday, the Iranian ministry of health revealed 10,339 new infections in the previous 24 hours, with the number of new deaths reaching 453, just six fewer than the record set on Sunday. Iran has now suffered 39,202 deaths since the virus struck, making it one of the most afflicted countries not just in the Middle East but the world. The Iranian authorities have imposed a nightly shutdown of businesses in Tehran from 6pm in an attempt to halt a disease that risks spiralling out of control in a country suffering severe pressure on its health services. But many health experts and politicians regard the measures as inadequate, with the number of daily new infections rising from just over 5,000 a day on 20 October to Tuesday’s high of 10,339. The total number of recorded cases increased to 703,283.
At a press conference, the government spokesman Ali Rabiei said the most important issue facing the country was the fight against the virus, and claimed a new mutation was at large. He declared that the virus now spreading in the country did not follow the behaviour of previous iterations, adding “it has undergone many dramatic changes from the beginning until today”. He continued: “So far, 88% of the deaths were from the elderly and people with underlying diseases, but now the virus is affecting younger people even more severely.” He said: “600 daily deaths in France show these changes.” While it is well established that the coronavirus has gone through a number of mutations, various claims over the course of the pandemic that it could be becoming either more contagious, lethal or even less severe have generally seen pushback from the World Health Organization and other health bodies that have been monitoring the changes to the virus. The most recent mutation to draw attention was a variant found in mink in Danish fur farms, which prompted so far unsupported claims last week that it might be resistant to a future vaccine. Rabiei urged Iranians not to be tired with the struggle against the disease, but instead to adhere to the protocols even more closely, adding many of the transmissions seemed to be occurring mainly in family settings or in buildings with little ventilation. Hossein Ali Shahriari, the head of the parliamentary health commission, wrote a letter to the president asking him to shut down Tehran and its metropolitan areas for 15 to 30 days due to the severity of the outbreak. He said the damage of a two-week shutdown would be less than leaving the crisis as it stood with hospital beds running out. The financial cost to the government of supporting workers and small businesses hit by the shutdown would be less than the cost to the health service, he said. The nightly 6pm business curfew and fines for not wearing masks were not sufficient steps, he said. With the Iranian political classes hotly debating the implications of Joe Biden’s election as president for the terms of a possible US return to the Iranian nuclear deal, the future of the Iranian economy and the potential lifting of sanctions, many Iranian officials want to keep the focus on fighting the virus by creating what is described as a huge social movement to save one another’s lives through acting responsibly to one another. Iranian front pages have run photos showing the faces of 99 health workers killed by the virus, and urging their readers to recognise their responsibilities.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1898,Tuesday briefing: Vaccine news moves the needle in Covid fight,11/10/20,"Top story: Mental health aftermath of virus Good morning, Warren Murray here to help you engage with Tuesday. Britain could start distributing a coronavirus vaccine by Christmas, the deputy chief medical officer has said, after large-scale trials showed the Pfizer/BioNTech trial vaccine to be 90% effective. But Prof Jonathan Van-Tam warned no vaccine would come soon enough to stop significant restrictions on public life during the second wave. Boris Johnson said that should the Pfizer vaccine pass all its safety checks, the UK had ordered 40 million doses, which would cover about a third of the population since each person needs two doses. It remains unclear if the vaccine prevents people catching the virus and passing it on, or rather prevents someone developing symptoms. Van-Tam said older people would be first in line with prioritisation decided by an independent committee. Some of the youngest children have been going backwards in learning and life skills during the pandemic – forgetting their potty training, losing their grasp of basic numbers and no longer able to use a knife and fork, Ofsted has warned. Nearly one in five people who have had Covid-19 are diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder such as anxiety, depression or insomnia within three months of testing positive, according to a study of US patients that was run from the University of Oxford. Three survivors have told the Guardian’s science correspondent Nicola Davis how coming down with coronavirus affected their mental wellbeing. * * * Trump signals cabinet purge – Donald Trump has sacked his defence secretary, Mark Esper, for refusing to fall into line with the president and there is talk of a purge in the outgoing administration against officials who refuse to help undermine the legitimacy of the election result. The legality of Esper’s replacement is being questioned: Trump has drafted Christopher C Miller, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, into the job when Esper’s deputy should have taken over. William Barr, Trump’s attorney general, has authorised federal prosecutors to begin investigating “substantial allegations” of voter irregularities – a break with longstanding practice that comes amid a lack of evidence of any major fraud. * * * Lords rebuffs illegal bill – Boris Johnson has put himself on a collision course with the Joe Biden administration in the US after Downing Street said it would press ahead with legislation to override the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. The House of Lords on Monday rejected measures that seek to “disapply” parts of the Northern Ireland protocol – which Biden has said would put the Good Friday agreement at risk. The government has said it intends to put the measures back in. The former prime minister Sir John Major has weighed in, saying Britain’s global reputation has been damaged and lawyers have been left “incredulous” by the government’s determination to override key elements of the Brexit deal. * * * Accord in Nagorno-Karabakh – Armenia’s prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, has signed a “painful” deal with the leaders of Azerbaijan and Russia to end the military conflict over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region after more than a month of bloodshed. The declaration on Tuesday morning follows six weeks of heavy fighting in which Azerbaijan’s forces have retaken land lost in a conflict between the two countries in the 1990s, leaving hundreds dead and forcing thousands of ethnic Armenians to flee into Armenia. The region has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since 1994. Russia is to send in 1,960 peacekeepers under a five-year mandate as part of the peace deal. * * * Hope for Saudi political prisoners – Saudi Arabia is considering clemency for jailed female activists ahead of its virtual hosting of the G20 summit on 21-22 November, the Saudi ambassador to the UK has said. The summit has brought the kingdom under renewed pressure on, for instance, the fate of a group of women who were prominent in the campaign for the right to drive. One of the jailed women, Loujain al-Hathloul, has been on hunger strike since 26 October. Hathloul was arrested with nine other women’s rights advocates in May 2018, months before women were finally granted the right to drive. At least five of those arrested remain in jail.

Augusta would usually be banking on a bonanza as the Masters rolls into town but the situation is anything but before the season’s now third and final major. In a further sign of changed days at Augusta National, Lee Elder, the first black man to play in the tournament, will take a role of honorary starter in 2021. England’s Nations League match against Iceland next Wednesday could be played in Albania or Germany after the Football Association held emergency talks with the government to decide whether the game can go ahead at Wembley.

Wayne Pivac has admitted his Wales setup could be perceived as “a mess” after the sacking of the defence coach, Byron Hayward, less than a year into the job. And Premier League clubs are yet to schedule a third vote on whether to allow five substitutions during matches despite growing pressure to reconsider.

1899,Typhoid Dido proves fluent in management bollocks and contradiction | John Crace,11/10/20,"Towards the end of his interview on the Today programme, Matt Hancock was asked if Kate Bingham, the head of the UK vaccines taskforce, was right to hand out £670,000 in PR contracts to some of her old muckers. Of course, the health secretary insisted, because she had done a great job in procuring possible vaccines. Then Matt doubled down. “I would go out of my way to thank Kate Bingham,” he said. The £670,000 in unnecessary media advisers was just a sideshow. A political distraction. “She has given up six months of her life to help the government,” he concluded with a flourish. It would be nice if everyone received such gratitude from a government minister just for doing their job. But I guess you win some and you lose some. And to be fair, not many people have gone out of their way to praise Hancock for the job he has done. There again he hasn’t always done it that well.
Which brings us nicely on to Dido Harding, the chief exec of the misnamed NHS test and trace, given that most contracts have been outsourced to private companies. Fair to say that test and trace has failed on even the mediocre metrics it has set itself under Harding’s leadership. And yet she is somehow untouchable. If anyone else had presided over this mess they would have been on a last warning at the very least, but Typhoid Dido continues on serenely. It probably helps that, like Bingham, she is married to a Tory MP – there must be a lot of Conservative partners upset to have missed out on this avenue for preferment – but what most counts in her favour is that she at least is doing it for nothing. Call it charity work. And it’s hard to moan too much if someone is useless when they are paid nothing to be useless. Nevertheless, Typhoid Dido still finds herself accountable for what is one of the most important strategies for controlling the spread of coronavirus and she today found herself giving evidence to the health and science select committees on progress so far. Or rather the lack of it. To her credit, Harding is at least a trier. She has the appearance of someone prepared to put the hours in, even if they aren’t always put to much obvious use. The session started with some quibbles over numbers. How much of the test and trace was done nationally and how much locally, asked Greg Clark. “We have a team of teams,” replied Harding, “and are locally led but nationally supported”. If nothing else Typhoid Dido is fluent in management bollocks. Clark tried to press her on the exact figures. “I’m afraid I don’t have the exact numbers to hand,” she shrugged. This was to become a constant refrain throughout the two hours she was before the committee. Jeremy Hunt was next to press Harding on the details. By his estimates, test and trace ought to be making contact with 177,000 people per day but was scrabbling around near the 5,000 mark. This was success rate of just 3%. Typhoid Dido thought this was a little unfair – people would be more inclined to isolate if they were paid to do so – and that her organisation was achieving a hit rate of between 10-20%. Hunt pointed out that even this was nothing much to boast about and could explain why Sage had described test and trace as having a marginal effect back in September. For most of the rest of the time Typhoid Dido seemed to do her best to contradict herself. Yes, they had known a second wave was coming but it had been impossible to predict how severe it would be even though every person and their dog had foreseen mayhem when the schools and universities went back. She also tried to lower the expectations of test and trace – “we’re only a small part in the national effort” – before claiming she had built an organisation bigger than Asda. The difference being that Asda does deliver. If the supermarket had been run like test and trace it would have gone out of business years ago. Labour’s Graham Stringer was one of the few to attempt to point out the obvious flaws in Harding’s answers. If it was taking three days to get test results back then the system was dead in the water. Even Harding’s claim that more than 60% of results came back in two days was hardly anything to crow about. Typhoid Dido went silent. “If you want to be effective then you have to provide some answers,” Stringer observed. Though that rather assumed that Harding had ever remembered to ask the questions in the first place. Predictably, the meeting ended with no one much the wiser about anything. Was test and trace an inherently flawed, badly designed system or was Harding just a hopeless chief exec? Or both? Over in the Commons, Hancock was in an unusually good mood. But then he often is when he’s come to the chamber with nothing much to say, as there’s not much that can go wrong. He swore on his life that not one Danish mink would infect a single Brit, before repeating the news about the vaccine that the prime minister and others had released the day before and ending by re-announcing that the quick result lateral flow test being piloted in Liverpool was going to be extended to 67 other regions. Not even the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, could quibble with that and basically just gave Door Matt the thumbs up. As did everyone else. After months of nothing but bad news, MPs from all sides could do with something vaguely positive. No one knew if the vaccine would work or if the lateral flow tests would be of much value, but just for today they were going to take time off from the shit hitting the fan and allow themselves a moment of hope.

1900,Uğur Şahin and Özlem Türeci: German 'dream team' behind vaccine,11/10/20,"They are the “dream team” scientist couple who came up with a big idea that could protect humanity from a virus that has killed more than a million people and put an end to a pandemic that has upended economies across the globe. But as the world breathed a sigh of relief at Monday’s news that the experimental vaccine developed by German biotech company BioNTech and US pharmaceutical company Pfizer has shown positive results in the all-important phase 3 trials, Uğur Şahin and Özlem Türeci displayed characteristic modesty. BioNTech chief executive, Şahin, known for still cycling on bike to the headquarters of a company currently valued at $21.9bn (£16.6bn), said the trial results were above all a “victory for innovation, science and of a global collaborative effort”, which might hopefully help the world “regain a sense of normalcy”. The comments hinted at the scientific rigour, unrelenting work ethic and appetite for entrepreneurship that has seen Sahin and Türeci’s company outpace more well-established competitors in the race for a Covid-19 vaccine – and made the couple the first Germans with Turkish roots to enter their country’s rich list this autumn, at number 93.
Both scientists are the children of Turkish migrants who moved to Germany in the late 1960s. Şahin, 55, was born in İskenderun on the Mediterranean coast but moved to Germany as a four-year-old, where his father worked at the Ford factory in Cologne. Fifty-three-year-old Türeci, BioNTech’s chief medical officer, grew up in Lastrup, Lower Saxony, where her Istanbul-born father worked as a surgeon at a small Catholic hospital. For both, cross-pollinating cultures proved dynamic childhood environments: Türeci has described herself as a “Prussian Turk” and spoken in interviews of her admiration for the nuns who looked after patients at her father’s hospital, while football-fan Şahin found inspiration in popular science books he took out from the library at his local church. After gaining his doctor with a thesis on immunotherapy treatment for cancer cells, Şahin followed his PhD supervisor to Saarland University in the town of Homburg, where Türeci was studying medicine. The couple married in 2002, interrupting their research only briefly to slip out of their lab coats and dash to the registry office on their wedding day. Their daughter was born four years later. Since 2001, Şahin and Türeci have been based in Mainz, a city on the river Rhine famous for its carnival culture and as the home of Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the movable-type printing press. The two scientists showed a similar enterprising zeal. At Mainz university hospital, the couple planned to set up a research lab to investigate how immune systems could be trained to attack cancerous cells. When research funds were hard to come by “we simply started our own company”, Şahin told news portal Heise.
“Their first company, founded in 2001, was called Ganymed – not after the handsome hero of Greek myth but a Turkish expression roughly meaning “earned through hard work”, as Türeci told Süddeutsche Zeitung. The company, which pioneered precision antibody therapies against cancer, was sold to Japanese pharma company Astellas for €1.4bn in 2016. They founded their second company BioNTech in 2008 with the Austrian oncologist Christoph Huber, who still sits on the supervisory board. With BioNTech, which has currently some 1,300 employees, the couple first set to develop immunotherapy cancer treatments, using genetic material called mRNA to train the human body to produce its own antigene. Years of experience with the mRNA method came in handy when news of the novel coronavirus reached the scientist couple at the start of the year. Şahin says he first read about Covid-19 in the Lancet on Friday 24 January 2020: the following Monday he summoned his employees that the company would pivot to finding a coronavirus vaccine. Some of his colleagues were displeased, already focused on their skiing holidays, he told the Wall Street Journal. But Şahin persisted. US pharmaceutical company Pfizer, which has previously collaborated with BioNTech on a flu vaccine, was quickly convinced to help with development and distribution costs. By March, when Germany entered its first lockdown, BioNTech had already developed 20 candidates for a vaccine, of which it would go on to test five for immune reactions in a research programme accompanied by 500 scientists called Lightspeed. The breakthrough came in early November, after an interim analysis showed their vaccine candidate to be 90% effective in protecting people from transmission of the virus in global trials, better than most experts had hoped for. Asked whether when he would take the vaccine himself, Şahin told German news website Business Insider: “As soon as the vaccine has been permitted, I will be one of the first to do it. But first we have to make sure that the vaccine arrives with those people who need it urgently: especially the elderly, people with pre-existing conditions and medical staff.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1901,UK expels Belarus diplomats in tit-for-tat move,11/10/20,"Britain has expelled two Belarusian diplomats in response to the removal of two UK envoys from the former Soviet bloc country, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has said. The move came after the British diplomats, including a defence attache, were ordered home from the capital, Minsk. The British diplomats were expelled on Monday after Belarus objected to their observation of street protests in Minsk on Sunday. Raab said the expulsions ran counter to diplomatic norms since the two diplomats had been carrying out legitimate duties. The Belarusian ambassador, Maxim Yermalovich, was summoned to the Foreign Office on Tuesday afternoon to be informed of the decision. The UK said its decision was appropriate and proportionate. Britain has already imposed sanctions on the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, following his disputed re-election in August. Opponents called for a re-run of the poll amid widespread claims of vote-rigging and a brutal crackdown on demonstrators by the authorities. In its statement, the UK Foreign Office said: “During the summons, the UK government reiterated that the only way forward is for fresh elections to be held and for those responsible for violence against demonstrators to be held to account”. “We have sent a clear message today to Lukashenko’s regime that their unjustified expulsion of British diplomats has consequences. The UK will continue to hold the Belarusian authorities to account for the rigged election in August and their ongoing use of violence to suppress the Belarusian people.” The UK has already responded robustly to the torture and mistreatment of hundreds of peaceful protesters in custody by imposing landmark sanctions on Lukashenko and senior figures in the Belarusian government under the UK’s new human rights sanctions regime.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1902,UK set to cut Covid self-isolation to 10 days after Cummings and Whitty row,11/10/20,"The Covid self-isolation period is expected to be cut from two weeks to 10 days after a row involving Prof Chris Whitty and Dominic Cummings, who had been pushing for a more drastic change, the Guardian understands. The reduced quarantine time is to be made possible by increasing the use of rapid tests – for which the UK government has paid more than £500m, despite the fact that some are not designed to test people without symptoms. It comes amid growing concerns about compliance, with only 11% of people abiding fully by the current two-week self-isolation rule, according to research by King’s College London in September. Under the new proposals, people are expected to be allowed to stop self-isolating on the 10th day after coming into contact with an infected person, following a negative test, in the hope this will improve compliance. But if they test positive on that date, they will be asked to continue self-isolating for a further eight days. The planned change is a compromise hammered out at No 10 after Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, rejected proposals instigated by Cummings, the prime minister’s most senior aide, for a more dramatic cut in the quarantine period, according to a source with knowledge of the discussions. Downing Street did not deny the claims.
According to the source, Whitty discovered on Tuesday last week that a press release had been drafted to use the rapid tests to halve self-isolation to seven days, with the eventual goal of scrapping the self-isolation period entirely by offering tests to people as soon as they are notified of a contact with an infected person. Whitty is said to have been implacably opposed on public health grounds, arguing that the incubation period for the virus was too long to allow immediate testing and the rapid tests would fail to detect every infected person. The proposal to test after eight days, with permission to leave the house on the 10th day, was “cooked up” as a compromise, to placate Cummings, the source said. Separately, experts have expressed surprise at the size of the contract of £500m awarded to Innova, a California-based company owned by an equity house that has bought rights to a lateral flow test made in China by Xiamen Biotime Biotechnology. The tests are being supplied in the UK by a little-known micro-company, Disruptive Nanotechnology, which is based in a house in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. It is understood that Disruptive Nanotechnology helped Innova navigate the bureaucratic formalities to get an assessment from Public Health England’s labs at Porton Down. The UK’s three devolved governments in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Stormont are being consulted on the new proposal and their agreement will be needed before the policy can be implemented. They are understood to be seriously considering it to increase compliance but have concerns about the test’s accuracy.
Lateral flow tests can give results within half an hour but detailed data on accuracy for the Innova test from the Porton Down evaluation has not been disclosed. They identify a protein on the surface of the virus, called an antigen, but they work better when there is a lot of virus in the nose swab sample and can miss low viral loads. As the Guardian reported last week, Innova’s product has not been designed for mass testing, and its leaflet is open in saying it is for people who have symptoms rather than those who are asymptomatic. The devices, which look like a pregnancy test, are intended to be read by a healthcare professional. The tests could lead to an end to quarantine for travellers, according to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps. He told the Airport Operators Association conference that the developments should encourage more people to fly. Shapps said: “I want you to know that we’ve been making very good progress on a test-to-release programme to launch once we’re out of lockdown. This will consist of a single test for arrivals into the UK, provided by the private sector and at the cost of the passenger, allowing a much reduced period of self isolation.” The lateral flow tests, which have been trialled in Liverpool, gave “hope for optimism”, he added: “Ultimately, it could open the way for non-quarantined air travel.” There are also concerns that a self-isolation policy based on several different dates – involving testing after eight days, leaving self-isolation on the 10th day or accepting another eight days’ quarantine after a positive test - could be confusing for the public. “Discussions are ongoing between the administrations about the self-isolation period. This is all based on evidence and data from Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] whether or not reducing the self-isolation time from 14 days to, say, 10 days, whether that would allow greater compliance,” said one official. Innova has been awarded two large contracts without tender, as is permitted in an emergency. The first was for £138m – said to be for 20m tests, nearly £7 each – and the second for £496m. The second contract lists extra justifications for the award. The World Health Organization has recently approved two lateral flow tests, from SD Biosensor and Abbott. A global procurement process has secured 120m of the tests at $5 (£3.80) each, many of which will go to low-income countries. Germany, France and Switzerland are among the countries to have bought them. Because of this global buy-up, and also the purchase of 150m tests by the US, the contract says, there is high demand. A No 10 spokesperson said: “Self-isolation is a vital tool in our fight to suppress the virus, so work is ongoing on options to increase the number of people doing so, including reviewing the self-isolation time period.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1903,UK trade department faces race to get £80bn of trade agreements ratified,11/10/20,"Liz Truss’s Department for International Trade (DIT) is scrambling to meet a Wednesday deadline for tabling £80bn of trade agreements before parliament, in time for them to come into force in January under standard procedures. Truss’s department has signed a string of “continuity agreements” to ensure the UK can go on trading with non-EU countries on similar terms, when the Brexit transition period comes to an end on 31 December. Under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act (Crag) passed in 2010, international treaties have to be laid before parliament for 21 sitting days before they can be ratified.
With parliament due to rise for Christmas on 17 December, as of this Thursday only 21 sitting days remain before the new year. DIT published parliamentary reports on two deals, with Ukraine and Ivory Coast, on Monday, and details of the Japan deal struck in September have also already been published for MPs to scrutinise. But talks are not yet completed with 15 countries, including Canada, Turkey and Singapore. The shadow trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, has written to Truss, urging her to explain the delay, and demanding she update parliament on the process. In the letter, Thornberry said that during 2019 there was “clear momentum behind this process”, with 20 continuity agreements made. “However, as your department’s focus switched in 2020 to the talks on potential new free trade agreements with the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the [comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership] CPTPP, as well as an enhanced continuity agreement with Japan, last year’s momentum appeared to die out,” Thornberry said. “Not a single additional continuity agreement was secured in the first eight months of 2020, and in their correspondence with the shadow international trade team, representatives of countries ranging from Cameroon to Montenegro have reported that no formal talks were even conducted in that period.” Thornberry said that while Truss had promised agreements would be shared confidentially with the Commons international trade committee, this had not happened for in-progress deals with Ukraine, Ivory Coast and Kenya, and would be now impossible with the 15 outstanding examples. “What makes this abysmal and shambolic state of affairs all the worse is that when we look at the length of time your department has had to get these agreements in place, ensure proper parliamentary scrutiny, and protect our continued free trade, it has been so totally avoidable,” the letter said. “In many cases, your department has had more than four years since the Brexit referendum to secure the 15 outstanding continuity agreements.” Without a continuity agreement in place, trade with these countries would revert to less favourable World Trade Organization terms. However, DIT argues that it is not uncommon for countries to use a provisional application, meaning a renewed trade deal would come into force before the 21-day period begins or is completed. But Thornberry’s letter argues that it would be “very regrettable” to do this, or to use an “exceptional cases” provision under the Crag law: “Those provisions exist to cater for unusual circumstances, not to cover for entirely avoidable incompetence.” The DIT said: “We are considering all possible options to maintain continuity of existing trade terms and will look to sign further agreements in the coming weeks. “We are working with our partners to ensure that signed continuity agreements with all 52 partner countries are able to enter into force after the end of the transition period.” Its spokesperson added: “It is misleading to say there’s a hard deadline on this,” claiming Truss had not promised to share deals with the committee 10 days in advance of laying them before parliament. Truss told the House of Commons last month: “We will always endeavour to make sure the committees have at least 10 sitting days to read through these on a confidential basis, as we are doing for this deal.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1904,UK universities seek legal and funding clarity over mass Covid testing plan,11/10/20,"UK universities are seeking assurances on funding and protections from being sued before they commit to government plans to get students home for Christmas through a mass testing scheme on campuses. The testing could begin as early as 30 November under plans detailed in a letter from the universities minister, Michelle Donnelan, who invited vice-chancellors to register their interest by the end of the week. The planning envisages a week of testing between 30 November and 6 December, ending a few days after the England lockdown is due to finish. Attempts are also being made to ensure the planning would be coordinated across the UK, with civil servants in Scotland holding discussions on Tuesday with universities there for example. But university authorities are seeking clarity in a number of areas including how they would avoid being left open to the possibility of legal claims. Details are also being sought about how the initiative will be funded, as well as assurances around validation of test results.
Under the plans, as understood by universities, preparations at testing sites would begin as early as next week while the test kits capable of giving results within an hour would be provided free of charge to universities. It follows pilot schemes at Durham and De Montfort Universities. Universities UK, which speaks for 140 universities in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, welcomed the government’s “ambition” to enhance testing for students and staff. But it added: “For a major rollout of asymptomatic testing to be successful, universities now need clear assurance of the effectiveness of the tests as well as further details from the government on specific responsibilities under the proposed scheme including the governance, indemnity, resourcing and costs recovery.” The move towards testing that would also include asymptomatic students marks a change in the position of the government, which has avoided stating that it would do so despite pressure from universities and others. The prime minister promised on Monday night that guidance for university students wishing to return home for Christmas would be issued soon. “Clearly we don’t want young people going back and infecting elderly members of their family over the Christmas period,” he said. The Independent Sage committee of experts warned in a report last week that without careful planning there were likely to be two new Covid-19 outbreaks as students travelled between towns and cities in the UK and internationally to go home for the Christmas break and return again in the new year. If possible, it recommended that students should self-isolate and/or be tested – ideally twice – before returning home, as well as when at home. Testing capacity must be increased to enable this to happen, it said. A number of UK universities have been running their own efforts to test students and staff for Covid-19, rather than relying on the much-criticised system being run in England. There was a warning on Tuesday by a union representing academics and support staff that plans to mass test students “presented huge logistical challenges that may leave staff and students stuck in limbo”. Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said: “Some of our concerns include whether all universities will be able to take part, how the tests will be administered, who will cover the costs, what the plan is for students who commute to campus daily from their family home, and how students who aren’t able to be tested will travel home safely.” She reiterated a call – which has also been made by Independent Sage – for the government to tell universities to immediately move all non-essential in-person teaching online.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1905,US accused of using Covid as excuse to deny children their right to asylum,11/10/20,"US authorities have radically accelerated the expulsion of unaccompanied children to Guatemala, but advocates accuse the Trump administration of using the Covid-19 pandemic as a pretext to rob vulnerable youngsters of asylum protections enshrined in US and international law.
Since tighter migration controls were announced in March, the US has deported more than 1,400 unaccompanied minors to Guatemala, according to data from the Guatemalan Migration Institute. A total of 407 children were expelled in October alone. In comparison, in the whole of 2019, the US deported 385 unaccompanied minors to Guatemala. US officials cited the threat of coronavirus when they invoked Title 42, a previously obscure clause of the 1944 Public Health Services Law, to justify the crackdown. The law, which gives the government the power to take emergency action to prevent “introduction of communicable diseases”, orders the immediate expulsion of migrants detained between ports of entry. It also denies nearly everyone who arrives at the border the ability to apply for asylum. Migration legal advocates argue the measure violates migrants’ rights to access the asylum process. “Without a court order currently blocking the Trump administration from subjecting unaccompanied children to these rapid expulsions, children continue to be denied their right to seek protection in the United States,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a lawyer and policy counsel with the American Immigration Council. “Under the Title 42 expulsion process the government has argued that public health laws override all normal immigration laws, and allows them to deport children without ever giving them their right to seek protection,” he said. “The Trump administration has taken what are generalized quarantine powers and interpreted into the powers the authority to expel people and override normal immigration law, which is why we say this is an unlawful policy.” The surge in the repatriation of unaccompanied minors comes at the same time as the a sharp rise in the deportations of Cameroonian and other African asylum seekers, many of whom are alleged to have forced to sign or fingerprint their deportation orders.
According to Witness at the Border, an immigrant rights advocacy group, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) carried out 129 flights believed to be deportations, more than any other in 2020, including months before the start of the pandemic. In July, the Associated Press revealed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) was housing unaccompanied minors in hotels before expulsion. That policy was halted by a federal judge in September, but rapid expulsions of minors have continued. On arrival in Guatemala, child migrants are taken into the care of the presidency’s social wellbeing secretariat and lodged in a shelter in Guatemala City before being reunited with their families. Organizations from civil society like the Pop No’j Association, which works within indigenous communities across Guatemala, often help migrants return to their homes. The organization also assists with psychological attention for minors who have suffered the trauma caused by the deportation and expulsion. Many of the children’s families lack the money to pay for their return to their communities. “The majority of families do not have the economic resources to travel to Guatemala City,” Silvia Raquec, the coordinator of immigration issues for Pop No’j, told the Guardian. The pandemic initially caused a freeze in migration through Central America, as countries closed their borders and imposed lockdowns. But since then, the flow of migrants from Guatemala has steadily increased – not least because of the devastating economic impact of lockdown measures, according to Raquec and to apprehension data from US Customs and Border Protection. “The conditions in countries of origin continue to worsen,” Raquec said. “The people continue to migrate, and people continue to have the idea that it is easier to pass with children, which isn’t true.” According to Raquec, a large number of younger minors migrate with family members or acquaintances, but are separated upon apprehension by the CPB agents. “The reality is that they are not going alone, they are going with a family member or a neighbor,” she said. “You are not going to find a child who goes to the US alone, there is normally an adult accompanying them. They are converted into unaccompanied minors at the moment of detention.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1906,US passes 10m Covid cases as virus rages across nation,11/10/20,"The number of US coronavirus cases passed 10m on Monday as the virus raged across many parts of the nation. The US recorded more than 100,000 new coronavirus cases for a fifth day in a row on Sunday, and the death toll passed 237,000.
The numbers were released as Joe Biden named the members of his own Covid taskforce – and it was reported that Ben Carson, the housing and urban development secretary, had become the latest senior Trump aide to test positive for the virus. Trump adviser David Bossie also tested positive as a new cluster of infections appeared to spring up in White House circles. There was also promising news from Europe about the quest for a vaccine. Some counts had previously put the US caseload over 10m but according to data from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, 105,927 new cases on Sunday brought the total to 9,964,540 earlier on Monday and the total did not pass the 10m mark until the afternoon. The daily number was down from record highs on Friday and Saturday. The death toll stood at 237,409. But with cases holding at more than 100,000 a day, Dr Anthony Fauci’s infamous warning earlier this month still rang true. “We’re in for a whole lot of hurt,” Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Washington Post. “It’s not a good situation. All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.” Deaths are expected to rise. “The next two months are going to be rough, difficult ones,” Dr Albert Ko, an infectious disease specialist at the Yale School of Public Health, told the Associated Press. “We could see another 100,000 deaths by January.” During the presidential election, Donald Trump repeatedly insisted the US was “rounding the corner” and refused to enforce mitigation measures at the White House and campaign events. On Monday, Carson followed the president, members of his family, senior White House and campaign aides and top Republicans in Congress in contracting the virus. Carson reportedly experienced symptoms and was tested at Walter Reed hospital, outside Washington DC, though he did not remain there for care. According to Bloomberg News, other attendees at a White House election night watch party last Tuesday included the attorney general, Bill Barr, the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the health secretary, Alex Azar. On Monday morning, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that interim results in large-scale trials showed their Covid-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective. The companies touted “a great day for science and humanity”. Biden heralded the scientists’ work, which will certainly be in demand. From Delaware, where transition planning continued, the president-elect said: “It is also important to understand that the end of the battle against Covid-19 is still months away.”
Even if the vaccine were to be approved by late November, as industry leaders predicted, Biden said “it will be many more months before there is widespread vaccination in this country.”
He also said that for now, “a mask remains a more potent weapon against the virus than the vaccine” and emphasized precautions such as face coverings, social distancing and contact tracing. Mike Pence tried to take credit for the vaccine breakthrough, claiming Trump’s Operation Warp Speed initiative had spurred it – an assertion Pfizer rejected outright. “We were never part of the Warp Speed,” said Kathrin Jansen, the head of vaccine research and development. “We have never taken any money from the US government, or from anyone.” Fauci, speaking on Monday afternoon to CNN, said the vaccine news was promising and that the US pharmaceutical company Moderna, in partnership with the federal government in what’s been dubbed Operation Warp Speed, was expecting results soon from trials of a vaccine almost identical to Pfizer’s. Fauci said that a vaccine was “right around the corner” and “help is on the way” for the world. Meanwhile, states across the US are struggling. On Sunday. the Republican governor of Utah, Gary Herbert, declared a new state of emergency. “Due to the alarming rate of Covid infections within our state, tonight I issued a new state of emergency with several critical changes to our response,” Herbert said. “These changes are not shutting down our economy, but are absolutely necessary to save lives and hospital capacity.” The governor said the state was being placed under a mask mandate until further notice and casual social gatherings were being limited to household-only for the next two weeks. All extracurricular activities were being put on hold, he said. Utah has had 132,621 total confirmed cases and 659 deaths. In California, governor Gavin Newsom warned on Monday that the state’s positivity rate was on the rise, after a period of relative success in containing the virus. He also said some counties could move “backward” into more restrictive rules for reopening. Fauci and other experts have described how the work of the White House coronavirus taskforce has stuttered and dwindled. On Sunday, the day after his victory over Trump was called, Biden made his first two appointments to his own panel of Covid advisers. The former surgeon general Dr Vivek Murthy and the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr David Kessler will be co-chairs. Members include Rick Bright, a scientist and Trump critic who quit the government in October; the surgeon and New Yorker writer Atul Gawande; bioethicist and former Obama aide Zeke Emanuel; Luciana Borio, the FDA acting chief scientist and national security council member under Trump; and Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Minnesota. • This article was amended on 10 November 2020. Michael Osterholm has been named as a member of Joe Biden’s Covid-19 taskforce, not “Michelle” Osterholm.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1907,Vaccine taskforce chief may benefit from £49m UK investment,11/10/20,"Kate Bingham, chair of the government’s vaccine taskforce, is facing questions over whether she will benefit from a $65m (£49m) UK taxpayer-backed investment into a fund run by her private equity firm. Bingham, a venture capitalist married to Treasury minister Jesse Norman, has already come under fire over allegations she revealed sensitive information to a private investors’ conference and insisted on hiring costly PR advisers. She is expected to leave her post at the end of the year, according to a government source who said her contract ran until January 2021 and she had always intended to leave at that point. Bingham “stepped away” from her role at private equity firm SV Health Investors in May to take an unpaid post as chair of the vaccine taskforce, which aims to ensure the UK population has access to vaccines as soon as possible. Two months later, SV Health Investors announced it had secured a $65m investment into its SV7 Impact Medicine Fund from British Patient Capital (BPC), which is entirely funded by the UK government. Accounts filed with Companies House show SV Health Investors earned at least £1.9m in management fees linked to its operation of the Impact Medicine Fund in 2019, before the government invested earlier this year. The accounts suggest Bingham, as one of the company’s two managing partners in the UK, receives an annual share of profits generated by SV Health Investors, suggesting she could stand to benefit personally from the performance of the fund. Her appointment to the vaccine taskforce was cited in the press release announcing BPC’s investment.
“In May 2020, Kate Bingham, managing partner, SV Health Investors, was appointed chair of the UK’s vaccine taskforce. In her work for SV, Kate’s biotech investments have resulted in the launch of six drugs for the treatment of patients with inflammatory and autoimmune disease and cancer making her uniquely qualified for the role,” the press release said. The shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, said: “It is vital that the government immediately show how they have managed any real or perceived conflict of interest with this appointment. Especially when you consider how many nurses wages $65 million could have paid for. “We need answers quick. Otherwise this appears to be another in a string of government appointments and contracts handed to friends without due process.” Nick Dearden, director of campaign group Global Justice Now, said: “There’s absolutely a conflict of interest. It’s deeply inappropriate. If governments in less wealthy countries behaved like this, we’d be lecturing them on ‘good governance.’” Asked whether the prime minister had full confidence in Bingham, a No 10 spokesman said: “Yes. The work of the vaccine task force is obviously of great importance and we have secured agreements for 350m doses overall of six leading vaccine candidates.” Labour had asked cabinet secretary Simon Case to investigate claims that Bingham disclosed sensitive information about potential targets for the government’s vaccines push to a $200-a-head private conference. According to a video of the event obtained by the Sunday Times, she showed financiers a detailed list of vaccines which the UK government was closely monitoring and could later invest in. Bingham reportedly told the event: “We haven’t necessarily signed contracts with all of them so far. But they’re all in our sights.” Several of the vaccines are owned or funded by publicly traded companies. Appearing before a joint select committee hearing last week, Bingham denied any wrongdoing and described the report as “nonsense”, “inaccurate” and “irresponsible”. She insisted her presentation had relied “on publicly available information and said little that expert delegates at the conference could not deduce themselves”. Bingham, who reports directly to the prime minister, has spent more than £500,000 of taxpayers’ money on hiring PR consultants from a firm called Admiral Associates, rather than rely on civil service press officers, according to leaked documents also obtained by the Sunday Times. The government has repeatedly been accused of cronyism in its management of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dido Harding, who was appointed to run the £12bn NHS Test and Trace programme without an open appointments process, is married to Conservative MP John Penrose. Harding is not taking a salary for her role, and an advertisement for her permanent replacement is expected to be placed shortly. The Department for Business, which oversees BPC and the vaccine taskforce, said: “Kate Bingham stepped back from her full-time role at SV Health Investors when appointed as chair of the vaccine taskforce. She declared her interest in BPC’s investment in a fund run by SV Health Investors, and appropriate mitigations are in place.” A BEIS spokesperson previously said: “As we have already made clear, Kate Bingham’s role as chair of the vaccine taskforce includes appearing at conferences, speaking to media and liaising closely with wider stakeholders.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1908,Vatican report faults successive popes over defrocked cardinal Theodore McCarrick,11/10/20,"Pope John Paul II promoted a senior figure in the US Catholic church in the face of persistent rumours of his sexual misconduct, a two-year Vatican investigation has found. The report, published on Tuesday, highlighted failings by successive popes, Vatican officials and US clerics who allowed Cardinal Theodore McCarrick to rise through church ranks despite multiple allegations of abuse. McCarrick, a former archbishop of Washington DC, became the most senior figure in the Catholic church to be defrocked after a Vatican hearing last year found him guilty of sexual crimes in the 1970 and 80s, “with the aggravating factor of the abuse of power”. Pope Francis, who was accused of ignoring the allegations against McCarrick, ordered an investigation in October 2018 – more than two decades after the alarm was first raised. The report largely absolves Francis of blame in the church’s failures over McCarrick. The inquiry heard from 90 witnesses and examined dozens of documents, letters and transcripts from Vatican and US church archives. Its 460-page document said the US church hierarchy was aware of consistent rumours that McCarrick preyed on adult male seminarians, but “credible evidence” did not surface until 2017. McCarrick has said he had no recollection of child abuse and has not commented publicly on allegations of misconduct with adults. Now aged 90, he is living in isolation. In 1999, Pope John Paul II was advised that it would be imprudent to promote McCarrick because of “rumours” of sexual misconduct with seminarians dating back to the 1980s. An investigation by the Vatican ambassador to the US, requested by the pontiff, “confirmed that McCarrick had shared a bed with young men” but said there was no certainty that he had engaged in sexual acts. In August 2000, McCarrick wrote to Pope John Paul’s private secretary rebutting the allegations. “McCarrick’s denial was believed,” the report said. Three months later, Pope John Paul appointed McCarrick archbishop of Washington DC, one of the most prestigious posts in the US church. The following year, McCarrick was made a cardinal, and became a celebrated fundraiser for the church, travelling extensively and enjoying privileged status. Pope John Paul’s willingness to believe McCarrick’s denial was probably influenced by his experience in his native Poland when the communist government used “spurious allegations against bishops to degrade the standing of the church,” the report said. One of McCarrick’s alleged victims said he had been sexually abused by the cleric from 1971, when he was a 16-year-old altar boy in New York. Another man subsequently claimed he had also been abused as a child by McCarrick, and several former trainee priests alleged they had been sexually harassed by the former cardinal at his New Jersey beach house. “During extended interviews, often emotional, [witnesses] described a range of behaviour, including sexual abuse or assault, unwanted sexual activity, intimate physical contact and the sharing of beds without physical touching. These interviews also included detailed accounts related to McCarrick’s abuse of authority and power,” the report said. Under Pope Benedict, who succeeded John Paul in 2005, more information came to light. McCarrick was eventually told he should withdraw as a bishop, and Benedict accepted McCarrick’s resignation in 2006. After he was elected in 2013, Pope Francis became aware of “allegations and rumours” concerning McCarrick’s past behaviour. “Believing the allegations had already been reviewed and rejected by Pope John Paul, and well aware that McCarrick was active during the papacy of Benedict XVI, Pope Francis did not see the need to alter the approach that had been adopted in prior years,” the report said. But after a former altar boy came forward in 2017 alleging that McCarrick had groped him when he was a minor in the 1970s, Francis ordered the canonical trial that resulted in his defrocking. In 2018, a retired Vatican diplomat accused the pontiff of being aware of rumours about McCarrick’s behaviour but failing to take action. In an 11-page testimony, archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, 77, a former Vatican ambassador to the US, called on Francis to step down, saying: “Corruption has reached the very top of the church’s hierarchy.” The accusations were seized on by Francis’s conservative enemies. The report – a rare example of self-scrutiny by the Vatican – throws a spotlight on what Pope Francis has called a “culture of clericalism” in the church, with cardinals, bishops and priests considered beyond reproach and claims of sexual abuse downplayed or dismissed as rumours.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1909,Will enough people in the UK take the Covid-19 jab?,11/10/20,"The spread of scepticism and misinformation about coronavirus and the development of a vaccine for it has raised questions about whether it will pose a threat to the goal of achieving widespread immunity. A report published on Tuesday by the British Academy and the Royal Society for the SET-C (Science in Emergencies Tasking: Covid-19) group said an 80% take up of a jab could be necessary in order for enough people to become immune to the virus and stop its spread. However, the actual threshold will depend on the efficacy of the vaccine, and the 90% achieved by the Pfizer/BioNTech candidate in trials was higher than many dared hope for. The report was the latest of several to cast doubt on the ability to reach such a threshold, finding that about 36% of people in the UK said they were either uncertain (27%) or very unlikely (9%) to be vaccinated against the virus. However, separate research, published in Vaccine on Tuesday, found that 90% of parents and guardians in England would likely accept a vaccine for themselves and 89% for their children.
Heidi Larson, director of the London-based Vaccine Confidence Project, said she had been involved in preprint research that found the willingness of people in the UK to have the vaccine fell by 6.4% after they were exposed to frequently circulated anti-vaccine posts, results she said were “striking”. She added: “It’s more likely that people say ‘sure I’ll do it’, but they might not, than people who say they won’t [accept a jab].” By contrast, Prof Stephan Lewandowsky, from the University of Bristol, who released The Conspiracy Theory Handbook earlier this year to challenge Covid misinformation, said that while it was difficult to make predictions at such an early stage, mounting numbers of people dying or falling seriously ill could make the difference. “My best guess is that when the vaccine is available people will be clamouring and lining up to get it, because they know this is the way out of this situation,” he said. He added that the UK traditionally had a high take-up for vaccines, with the exception of the flu vaccine, which was for a number of reasons including its low efficacy and the fact that the virus was not seen as life-threatening by many people. More prosaic concerns were also raised by the experts the Guardian spoke to, including ease of access to the vaccine. A study of H1N1 in the UK found that one of the strongest predictors of intentions not to vaccinate was given as: “I cannot be bothered.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5

1929,An own goal': experts question resignation of Hong Kong lawmakers,11/11/20,"On Thursday, Hong Kong’s legislature will look remarkably more like its counterpart in mainland China. It will sit without any opposition lawmakers after they announced their resignations in protest at four colleagues disqualified from the body on Wednesday under a new power granted to Hong Kong authorities by Beijing to dismiss “unpatriotic” politicians with immediate effect. The 70-member legislative council will then consist of only pro-Beijing lawmakers, turning into what several observers have described as a rubber-stamping body like China’s National People’s Congress (NPC), which passes pre-approved measures. “This is the end of any meaningful opposition. This is exactly the model that we are expected to shift to. It’s a huge paradigm shift,” said Kenneth Chan, a political scientist at the Hong Kong Baptist University and former pro-democracy lawmaker.
“Opposition in the legislative council has always been an eyesore to the powers that be. They would like LegCo to behave just like NPC deputies,” he said. On Wednesday, Beijing released a vague statement barring anyone from the legislature seen as supporting independence, seeking help from foreign forces to “interfere” in Hong Kong’s affairs or otherwise committing “acts that endanger national security”. Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, later added anyone objecting “in principle” to the sweeping national security law implemented in June, and said a government “must be composed of patriots”. The law took immediate effect and was used to disqualify four sitting members. Critics described it as a “death-knell” for the remaining democratic institutions of Hong Kong, whose courts, legal system and society are meant to enjoy a “high degree of autonomy” from Beijing under the “one country, two systems” framework. Analysts said the move, while abrupt, represents a progression of efforts to prevent pro-democracy candidates from holding office. In 2016, authorities disqualified a number of young lawmakers on the basis of oath-taking procedures. In 2018, Agnes Chow, a young activist, was barred from running on the basis that her party included self-determination for Hong Kong in its platform. After a year of protests and public anger at the government, as well as victories for opposition candidates in local district elections, pro-democracy candidates had launched a campaign to get half of the legislative council’s seats in the next election. But in June, a dozen candidates, including the four lawmakers disqualified on Wednesday, were barred from running after they made campaign promises to block government legislation if they succeeded. That election, scheduled for September, was delayed after the government invoked emergency powers, citing the Covid-19 pandemic. “Beijing has decided to snuff out the opposition. They want to minimise as effectively as possible the opposition forces so there won’t be any,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Others questioned the timing of the new measure and the targeting of four lawmakers who are considered moderates. In the past, the conventional wisdom was that Beijing would not tolerate the most radical wings of the pro-democracy camp. “The major message is that after today, they don’t want to provide room of survival for even moderate democrats,” said Ivan Choy, a senior lecturer on electoral politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. After the controversial delay of the legislative election in August, the NPC’s standing committee, the decision-making body of China’s legislature, said that all current lawmakers would continue their duties “for no less than one year” until a new session began. The change after three months suggests to Choy a shift in Beijing’s thinking, perhaps motivated by distraction in the US as the Trump administration – a supporter of the protests in Hong Kong – deals with the president’s election loss. “Perhaps they are taking advantage of this transitional period to do that – because they know they are busy,” he said. By resigning en masse, Hong Kong’s pro-democracy camp will effectively shut off one of the last formal channels of opposition within the government. The resignations will not affect quorum and the council’s ability to meet. Observers say this is probably what Beijing hoped would happen. “A symbolic gesture that doesn’t give you anything in practice, and a symbolic gesture that the other side would have calculated you would do and is quite happy for you to do, is a symbolic gesture that is effectively an own goal,” said Prof Steve Tsang, the director of the SOAS China Institute. “It’s Beijing flexing its muscle to say it can control Hong Kong.” Tsang said the new law would make it more difficult for pro-democracy constituents to elect legislative councillors that could speak up for them in the future, “which is exactly why they shouldn’t resign”.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1930,Buddha would be green': Dalai Lama calls for urgent climate action,11/11/20,"The Dalai Lama has appealed to world leaders to take urgent action against climate change, warning of ecological destruction affecting the lives of billions and ruining the planet, including his birth country, Tibet. As a call to action he has brought out a new book declaring that if Buddha returned to this world, “Buddha would be green”. In an interview for Channel 4 News and the Guardian, the Buddhist spiritual leader spoke from the Indian city of Dharamsala, where he has been exiled for six decades. He warned that “global warming may reach such a level that rivers will dry” and that “eventually Tibet will become like Afghanistan”, with terrible consequences for at least a billion people dependent on water from the plateau “at the roof of the world”. The 85-year-old Nobel peace laureate is considered by his followers to be the earthly manifestation of an enlightened one who has chosen rebirth in order to help liberate all living beings from suffering through compassion. Lhamo Thondup, as he was named at birth, was discovered as the latest incarnation of the Dalai Lama when he was just two years old. He uses Zoom to communicate with people around the globe these days, unable to travel or invite visitors because of the coronavirus pandemic. He insists, as he announced in 2011, that he is retired from politics and his leadership of the struggles for Tibetan freedom from China, and that ecology is now the thing that is “very, very important” to him. In the week the Cop26 UN climate conference was to have been held in Glasgow, he says has high expectations of world leaders, and wants them to act on the Paris climate agreement.
“The United Nations should take a more active role in this field,” he says. Asked whether world leaders are failing, he says: “The big nations should pay more attention to ecology. I hope you see those big nations who spent a lot of money for weapons or war turn their resources to the preservation of the climate.” The Dalai Lama says that if he joined a political party now, “I would like to join the Green party. Their idea is very good.” The Dalai Lama has been known to put his foot in it with inadvertent enthusiasm, such as when he said it was possible he could be succeeded by a woman, but that she should be “very, very attractive”. He later made clear that he had meant no offence and said he was deeply sorry that people had been hurt by his words. His suggestion for how to make world leaders see sense on climate change may also raise eyebrows, but again seems to be the product of a lively 85-year-old sense of humour. The Dalai Lama chuckles as he suggests we should lock them all in a room and “pipe carbon dioxide into it until they realise what climate change really means”. He explains that “people who have a certain luxury sort of style of life in a room without proper oxygen” would realise “it is very difficult”. The Dalai Lama says he is in favour of large-scale tree planting to help tackle climate change. He also believes meat consumption worldwide should fall dramatically, but explains that since his own decision to go vegetarian in 1965, health problems have led doctors to advise him to resume eating a little meat. He says his greatest personal contribution to fighting climate change is education and promoting the concept of compassion. The Dalai Lama is most passionate when talking about his idea of oneness among 7 billion people. “We see too much emphasis on my nation, my religion, their religion. That really is causing all these problems due to different religions and different nations are fighting. So now we really need oneness.” He even says he can now live as one with China, which he claims is “the biggest Buddhist population now”.
Nearing the end of this life, the Dalai Lama has not publicly explained how his reincarnation should be sought, or whether a 15th Dalai Lama should be found at all. He jokes that in his next life “I may be born on the Moon or Mars. Then I will starve.” In the past he has raised the idea of being the last in the line of Dalai Lamas, perhaps to prevent China naming a politically cooperative successor. For now, he says he wants to leave that decision to others. “As long as I live I should be useful to help other people. Then after that, not my business. These are the concerns of other people.” His advice for the rest of us living through the coronavirus pandemic is similarly practical, crediting an unnamed Indian scholar with the idea that “If there’s a way to overcome [coronavirus], then no need to worry. If there is no way to overcome, then it’s no use to worry too much either.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1931,Nikol is a traitor': Armenia PM refuses to yield to opposition after Nagorno-Karabakh deal,11/11/20,"The office of Armenia’s prime minister has said that it will not allow the opposition to seize power by force, as heated protests have continued for a second day after the signing of a ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh seen as a capitulation. Several thousand protesters defied martial law on Wednesday to gather in downtown Yerevan, Armenia’s capital, and call for the prime minister Nikol Pashinyan’s resignation. On Monday evening, he signed a Russian-brokered ceasefire that ceded territory to Azerbaijan that had been won in a bloody war in the 1990s. “Nikol is a traitor,” the protesters chanted. Opposition parties – though only one in parliament – have issued an ultimatum for Pashinyan to step down by midnight. Pashinyan’s chief of staff shot back: “We won’t allow criminal elements to take power and will apply all the measures provided for by law to do this. Have no doubt.” More than 400 Russian peacekeepers have already arrived in Nagorno-Karabakh, Moscow said on Thursday, part of a nearly 2,000-strong deployment that will remain in the region for the next five years. Maps of the deployment published for the first time on Wednesday showed that Russia will maintain 16 observation posts, including many along the Lachin corridor, a key lifeline between Armenia and the city of Stepanakert. But many questions remain about how the hastily drafted ceasefire will be implemented, including the return of refugees to the region, the handover of territories not captured by Azerbaijan during the war, and the final status of the Armenian-backed government in Nagorno-Karabakh when the Russian peacekeeping mission ends. And then there is Turkey, Azerbaijan’s main backer, which has claimed that it will also send peacekeepers to Nagorno-Karabakh despite repeated denials by Russia and Armenia that this is the case. Turkey is not a party to the ceasefire, nor is it mentioned in the agreement that provides a mandate for the Russian peacekeeping mission. However, the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Wednesday said he expected Turkish troops to monitor the ceasefire in Karabakh, citing a memorandum of understanding that he signed with Russia. That document has not been made public by the Kremlin.
“Turkey will join the peacekeeping forces in the [Karabakh] region to monitor the implementation of the deal with Russia,” Erdoğan said on Wednesday in remarks to his party in Ankara.
While Erdoğan’s statements appear to be bluster and there is no basis for Turkey to send peacekeeping forces to Nagorno-Karabakh, a conflict between Turkey and Russia could possibly undermine the political future of the ceasefire deal. Turkey’s diplomatic backing for Azerbaijan and provision of military technology, including drones, helped it quickly capture territory in the mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The ceasefire was hailed as a victory in both Baku and Ankara, where Erdoğan called it the end of an “occupation”. The deployment of Turkish troops to the region would inflame tensions in Armenia, where Ankara’s forces are rightly seen as partisan. Moscow pushed back again on Wednesday, saying that there was no agreement for Turkish forces to monitor a ceasefire between the two ex-Soviet countries. “No, there was no talk about joint peacekeeping forces. This subject has never been discussed. The joint interaction area will be in Azerbaijan’s territory, this won’t be Karabakh, and we’re talking about a monitoring centre,” said Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman. On Wednesday evening, the head of the Nagorno-Karabakh administration, which is called Artsakh, urged local Armenians not to flee the region as Azerbaijan consolidated control over the surrounding region. “We don’t have a final decision about what to do,” he said. “But I want to tell you that the roads will be safe. Do not move your property from Artsakh to Armenia. You will see that we will live in Artsakh.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1932,Barcelona launches 10-year plan to reclaim city streets from cars,11/11/20,"Barcelona has launched an ambitious 10-year plan to reclaim the city’s streets from cars and cut down pollution with the creation of green spaces and public squares. One in three streets in the heavily polluted central Eixample district – the 20th-century grid devised by the engineer Ildefons Cerdà – will become green zones under the scheme, giving priority to pedestrians and cyclists, and 21 public squares will be created at intersections so that no citizen is more than 200 metres from a square or small park. “The Cerdà plan modernised Barcelona at the end of the 19th century and we are reviving that spirit of urban transformation to bring the Eixample into the 21st century,” the deputy mayor, Janet Sanz, said.
The plan, estimated to cost €37.8m over the next 10 years, amounts to a rapid and radical extension of the so-called superblocks policy introduced in 2016. The superblock scheme groups together nine city blocks and closes them to through-traffic with plant pots and benches, introduces cycle lanes, play areas and green spaces and replaces many of the parking spaces with seating areas.
While cars aren’t banned, the superblocks are car-unfriendly. There are six so far, with as many as 11 more planned over the next few years – and more than 500 if the plan is carried out in its entirety. The superblocks provide an oasis of quiet in a city where citizens own 6,000 cars per square km, not counting vans or motorcycles, the highest in the EU. The new plan seeks to augment the city’s chronic lack of public space and address its equally chronic pollution problem. Barcelona almost never meets EU or World Health Organization limits for nitrogen dioxide or particulate pollution. WHO NO2 limits are 40 micrograms per cubic metre, while in much of the city the level is above 47 µg/m 3.
In common with cities such as Paris and Milan, the city has been practising “tactical urbanism” – widening pavements, temporarily closing streets, extending cycle lanes, closing parking spaces – to create more public space in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The measures have been widely welcomed and, while car lobbies are opposed, haven’t polarised opinion the way they have in some British cities. Since the lockdown was enforced in March, the city has created 29km of cycle lanes – bringing the total to nearly 240km – and 12km of pavement. In the same period, it has eliminated 1,300 parking spaces. The design for the squares and green spaces will be decided in open competition. The closing date for entries is 17 December.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1933,"Brexit uncertainty may cause sugar shortages in Northern Ireland, warns firm",11/11/20,"Tate & Lyle Sugars, a prominent corporate backer of Brexit, has warned of sugar and syrup shortages in Northern Ireland in the new year, due to lack of clarity over the UK and EU trade relationship. The company is the largest cane sugar brand in the UK and supplies the main supermarkets in Northern Ireland. It has advised retailers to draw up contingency plans to source sugar and syrup from elsewhere, because it will struggle to get its products to them next year, according to ITV News. Tate & Lyle Sugars, which was sold by Tate & Lyle plc to American Sugar Refining in 2010, said the uncertainty over Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol was likely to cause significant outages in Northern Ireland. The company owns the Thames Refinery in London, the biggest sugar refinery in Europe. Tate & Lyle Sugars, one of the few large companies that have publicly backed Brexit, has also donated to the Conservatives. It is in line to save £73m from a post-Brexit trade overhaul, after a long lobbying campaign by the firm. Gerald Mason, the senior vice president of Tate & Lyle Sugars, said: “As a responsible supplier, we have been working with our Northern Ireland customers on solutions that will allow us to continue supplying Northern Ireland shoppers after 1 January. “To support that, we need the EU and UK to agree commonsense rules that prioritise the Northern Ireland consumer by recognising there is little risk from allowing existing trade to continue. We know officials on both sides are working hard to negotiate exactly this to ensure security of supply.” The firm took part in a conference call organised by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, alongside other manufacturers, retailers and distributors. Associated British Foods (ABF), the company behind Twinings and Ryvita, is also thought to have expressed concerns at the lack of clarity about the future trading arrangements for Northern Ireland. It has a factory in Belfast.
An ABF spokesperson said: “Along with many other participants of the food industry, we are engaged in an open and constructive discussion with officials to identify potential issues, so that solutions can be identified well in advance.” Under the protocol, Northern Ireland will remain in the UK when the transition period ends on 31 December, but will also continue to be part of the single market and enforce the EU’s customs rules from next year. The UK government has promised Northern Ireland businesses “unfettered access” on goods going to the rest of the UK, but this does not apply to goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. A government spokesman said: “The UK and the EU have committed to an intensified process of engagement to resolve all outstanding issues with the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol which includes securing the flexibilities we need for trade from Britain to Northern Ireland. “This is particularly important for supermarkets, where we have been clear specific solutions are required. We will continue to work closely with the Northern Ireland executive as discussions continue with the EU through the joint committee process.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1934,Cambodian PM isolating after Covid outbreak linked to Hungarian minister,11/11/20,"Cambodia’s prime minister, Hun Sen, has gone into quarantine and the country has locked down schools, clubs and cinemas in the capital, Phnom Penh, and a surrounding province, after an outbreak of coronavirus cases linked to a visit by the Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó. Szijjártó made a short visit to Cambodia on 3 November as part of a planned trade tour to the region, then tested positive for Covid-19 when he arrived in Thailand later the same day. All his meetings were cancelled and he flew home the next day on a private plane. Since then, the trip has been linked to at least four cases of coronavirus in Cambodia, where at least 1,000 people connected with the visit have been tested, including Hun Sen and his wife. Four cabinet ministers were also quarantined after meeting Szijjártó. The country has largely escaped the ravages of the global pandemic through strict entry and quarantine requirements, with only 301 infections and no deaths recorded. With a weak and badly funded healthcare system, Cambodia could face a devastating toll if the disease took hold. Authorities appear to be taking no chances, shutting down schools in the capital and surrounding Kandal province for two weeks, after the education ministry said it was not able to collect enough information about students who had direct or indirect contact with Szijjártó. Schools across much of the country had reopened only last Monday, after being closed since March; in Phnom Penh a phased reopening had been underway for several weeks. Under the new measures the government also banned all state-organised events and shut clubs and cinemas for two weeks in and around the capital. Thai authorities also confirmed that a Hungarian diplomat who shared a car and a meal with the minister had tested positive; they said 16 other people who came in contact with him tested negative. The country has reported 3,847 infections and 600 deaths.
Hungary has reported an increase in the number of cases since September with more than 4,000 new daily infections and record casualties in recent days. The foreign ministry said Szijjártó had tested negative before his departure for Cambodia, Reuters reported. In photos of a meeting with Hun Sen and other senior politicians none of the participants appeared to be wearing masks. At the time, Szijjártó described his country as a “bridge to Europe” for Cambodia, the Diplomat reported. • This article was amended on 12 November 2020.

1935,China's biggest tech firms dive in value over Beijing crackdown fears,11/11/20,"Hundreds of millions of dollars have been wiped off the value of China’s biggest internet companies following two days of frenetic selling with investors fearing Beijing plans to curb the power of homegrown tech firms. Shares in Alibaba, a Chinese version of Amazon, dropped by 9.8% on Wednesday, while its rivals, Tencent and JD.com, fell by 7.4% and 9.2% respectively. The share declines coincided with China’s Singles’ Day, an unofficial holiday on 11 November which is billed as the world’s biggest online shopping event. Alibaba and other online retailers can smash sales records for daily trading on the day. Wednesday was the second day of heavy selling of Chinese tech stocks following the publication of Beijing’s draft plans to “prevent and stop monopolistic behaviours” of internet platforms. The smartphone maker Xiaomi closed down 8.2%, and shares in the on-demand delivery firm Meituan also lost 9.7%. In total more than $280bn has been wiped off the market value of the five Chinese tech heavyweights since Monday. Alibaba and JD.com shares are on track for their worst week ever. The sell-off was sparked when the State Administration for Market Regulations, China’s top regulator, published plans designed to limit the dominance of the big internet firms and “promote the sustainable and healthy development of the online economy”. Analysts warned that the plans indicated the Chinese government was changing tack to take firm action against big tech firms. Previously it has left them unhindered and championed them as evidence of Chinese entrepreneurial success. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at the trading firm Oanda, said: “China’s government is concerned about actual or possible monopolistic behaviour and the sheer size of the incumbents either leading to unfair competition or squeezing out new players and reducing competition.” He said the proposed regulations signalled a “much more vigorous regulatory environment”. The new regulatory action comes a week after the Chinese government intervened to halt the much anticipated initial public offering (IPO) of Ant Group, the country’s biggest financial technology group, which was set to raise $37bn in the world’s largest flotation. Ant Group is controlled by Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of Alibaba and China’s richest man. Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research, described the sudden decision to suspend Ant’s public listing as a disaster. “You don’t yank a $35bn IPO two days before it’s going to be launched internationally, it makes the regulatory system look completely arbitrary and also confused,” Collier told CNBC on Wednesday. “It suggests deep politics within China ... that’s bubbled to the surface and they couldn’t resolve [it] ahead of time. Regulation can be positive but this particular move was a disaster.” The Chinese administration last week summoned 27 internet platforms to discuss regulating the online economy. The platforms called to appear included Alibaba, Bytedance, Tencent, Pinduoduo, Baidu, and JD.com. The plunge in the value of Alibaba, which owns roughly a third of Ant Group, has wiped hundreds of millions from the paper fortune of Ma. A former English teacher, Ma founded Alibaba in a one-bedroom flat in 1999 and has amassed an estimated $62bn fortune. Ant Group’s stock-market filing revealed the firm collected 72.5bn yuan ($10.5bn) in revenue in the first half of the year, up nearly 40% on the same period in 2019. Profits were nearly 12 times greater at 21.9bn yuan, underlining how the firm had benefited from the coronavirus lockdown. Ma’s Alibaba owns 33% of Ant Group.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1936,Covid and Thanksgiving: CDC issues warning and bolsters mask-wearing guidance,11/11/20,"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has abruptly beefed up its advice to Americans on wearing masks to prevent the spread of coronavirus and warned against traditionally large gatherings over the holidays. Thanksgiving celebrations are safest kept within households – and face masks protect the wearer as well as those around them, the federal public health agency said this week, in new, more robust coronavirus guidelines. With just over two weeks to go before Thanksgiving, the CDC issued guidance on Tuesday on how to celebrate safely during the pandemic. Despite cases surging across the US, the CDC did not go as far as to rule out gatherings on Thursday 26 November. But it did suggest alternatives to hosting events with people from other households in person, such as communing online for virtual meals. “Traditional Thanksgiving gatherings with family and friends are fun but can increase the chances of getting or spreading Covid-19 or the flu … The safest way to celebrate this year is to celebrate with people in your household,” its latest online guidance says. However, it also included tips for those who are still planning to celebrate with other households. Other than mask-wearing, social distancing and hand washing, it also advised eating outdoors, limiting numbers, bringing your own food, drinks and utensils and opting for single-use condiments and disposable plates and utensils. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, has said each family needs to make their own “risk assessment” when it comes to Thanksgiving. In his own household, he said that he plans to have a “quiet dinner” with his wife, Christine Grady, and also to use Zoom to “gather” with their three adult daughters. The CDC also updated its guidance on mask-wearing, highlighting the benefits of masks as a form of protection for both incoming and outgoing droplets. Previously the emphasis was on the protection that wearing a mask offers to others. “Upwards of 80% blockage has been achieved in human experiments that have measured blocking of all respiratory droplets, with cloth masks in some studies performing on par with surgical masks as barriers for source control,” the CDC said. But it also stated for the first time that cloth masks can protect the wearer, too. “Studies demonstrate that cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers’ exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns,” it added. The new mask guidance marks a change of stance from the CDC’s previous softer approach, which said the “main protection” offered by mask-wearing was to others and that “the latest science may convince” people to wear masks. Public health officials have often been sidelined during the pandemic by the Trump administration, which the whistleblower Rick Bright said “ignores scientific expertise, overrules public health guidance and disrespects career scientists”. Bright, a former top vaccine official, was this week named as a member of president-elect Joe Biden’s new coronavirus advisory board.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1937,Covid: care home called police after woman sneaked in to see husband,11/11/20,"A care home called the police when a woman who had been denied visits to her 83-year-old husband for eight months amid the Covid pandemic sneaked in to get him out. Patricia Hodges, 75, used to visit her husband, Graham, daily at Wayside House in Bromsgrove, where he was being cared for with Lewy Body dementia. But her anguish at being prevented from seeing him from March to October, and a row over fees, sparked an attempt to move him to another home, she said. The incident on 28 October followed a dispute between the Hodges and the care home, which began with requests for visits being denied. It ended with the home’s owner being accused of “holding” Graham Hodges over missing fees, which the home strongly denies. Wayside House granted Patricia a visit the day before she tried to enter the home – the first in 221 days. By then the family had booked a new home and they were fearful of further isolation in the second wave of the pandemic. The dispute highlights a dilemma facing care homes being asked to balance infection control with the mental health of residents and their families. Last week a woman was arrested when she tried to release her mother from a care home in Humberside which had also stopped normal visiting. MPs are set to debate the issue in parliament on Wednesday. “I rang the doorbell and I wasn’t going to be let in,” said Patricia, describing how a handyman had left a side door open and she entered to get her husband out. She was confronted by the care home owner, Rakesh Kotecha, who warned she was a Covid risk and subsequently called the police. Officers eventually asked her to leave the building where she was staging an impromptu sit-in. In the car park, the Hodges argued to police that the home was exceeding its rights. Officers spoke by phone to social services and other professionals, who said there was no reason not to let Graham leave. He was finally allowed to move the next day. “When Graham came out to get into the wheelchair taxi, he let out a loud cheer and then started weeping when he saw Bethan [his daughter] and the grandchildren and told them he loved them all and would be able to give them a kiss now,” said Patricia. Kotecha said staff and residents could not be put at risk for one family to be able to visit, and that strict visiting restrictions and policies were needed to keep the home Covid-free. “Of course we would love to have families visiting,” he said. “In the pre-Covid world we had no restriction on visiting hours at all.” He added that the home has now started allowing visits in a specially prepared room. In June, Gethin Hodges, the resident’s son, had asked for a five-minute visit for his mother. He wrote: “My father is very frail and I don’t believe he will have many months ahead of him and it may well be the last chance my mum gets to see him.” The home replied that only end-of-life visits would be possible and offered to facilitate video calls. It said: “Our concern is that if there is a second pandemic that by reopening our doors too soon, [we] might allow the virus into the home.” The dispute developed when the Hodges declined to pay a 20% fee increase which the home said was to reflect increased costs from Covid such as for PPE. In August, increasingly concerned about Graham’s wellbeing without visitors, the family gave the home a month’s notice. Kotecha said he wouldn’t allow an assessment of the resident’s health to be made by the new home because of £12,000 in owed fees. But he denied the family’s claim he was trying to “hold” Graham until he received payment. He told the family: “It is the norm in the sector that another provider would not take a resident who has outstanding fees, as the new provider would not want to end up in the same position.” Kotecha said the money “was not an issue as the care and safety for our residents is first and foremost … A move from his home was not going to be in his best interest as his health may well deteriorate”. A fortnight later, Kotecha informed the family their August notice had “expired” and the home needed a new notice period to consider moving Graham. The family said it provided this on 1 October but Kotecha said he never received it. In late October, when the family said they were coming to collect him, the home said it still needed a period of notice. “We had written to the family on several occasions asking them to provide a rolling notice which would have taken care of this issue,” Kotecha said. “They failed to do so.

1938,Covid: England students to get six-day window to get home before Christmas,11/11/20,"Students in England will be given a six-day window next month in which to travel home before Christmas, with mass testing carried out on campus before they are allowed to leave. A mass exodus will take place on staggered departure dates set by universities from 3 December to 9 December after England’s four-week lockdown, under plans announced by the Department for Education (DfE)on Tuesday night. Students testing positive would need to remain in self-isolation for 10 days. In a major shift, the government said it would also instruct universities to then move learning online by 9 December so that students can have the option of returning home to study from there. It is not known what the plan is for after the Christmas period though a DfE spokesperson said details would be published “in due course”. But concerns among university staff and students were immediately sparked by the plans for what the government said would be known as the “student travel window” as universities sought assurances on funding and protections from being sued before committing to plans for a mass testing scheme on campuses. Dr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of universities, said the mandatory cut-off date for in-person teaching to deliver a “student travel window” would create practical challenges for universities, and called for clear guidance on a return to campus plan for the new year.
The testing could begin as early as 30 November under plans detailed in a letter from the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, who invited vice-chancellors to register their interest by the end of the week. The plan envisages a week of testing between 30 November and 6 December, ending a few days after the lockdown in England is due to finish. Attempts are also being made to ensure the planning would be coordinated across the UK, with civil servants in Scotland holding discussions on Tuesday with universities there. But university authorities are seeking clarity in a number of areas including how they would avoid being left open to the possibility of legal claims. Among vice-chancellors there was widespread concern about the practicality of the arrangements and the logistics of mass testing of students. One said he had been told it would take 40-50 full-time equivalent staff – if not more – to carry out the tests. Another said he was looking at using furloughed catering staff to do testing, but questions remained about space, cost and kit required, and what the plan might be for January. Durham University is already running a pilot project for rapid Covid-19 testing - including identifying those who might be infectious but have no symptoms. The lateral flow tests (LFT), which delivers results in just 30 minutes, uses a nose and throat swab and they are self-administered.
So far, several hundred staff and students at two of Durham’s colleges have taken part in the voluntary pilot. The university is now exploring whether it is feasible to roll out mass testing across the whole institution before Christmas. Sir David Bell, vice-chancellor and chief executive of the University of Sunderland, said infection rates had declined in universities, which reduced risks but warned that there was not much time. “Universities have worked successfully with councils and local public health authorities to manage the impact of the virus,” he said. “Any arrangements that central government proposes must be capable of implementation and so there is a need for urgent discussions with local partners before we can decide what will work. Time is short and universities are being asked to make decisions at breakneck speed which we are capable of doing, provided they are in the best interests of our students.” Under the testing plans, as understood by universities, preparations at testing sites would begin as early as next week while the test kits capable of giving results within an hour would be provided free of charge to universities. It follows pilot schemes at Durham and De Montfort Universities. Meanwhile, around 65,000 students at Scottish universities, including thousands studying there from other parts of the UK, are expected to be asked to take two negative Covid-19 tests five days apart. Their testing dates and return home will be staggered to avoid a mass exodus. The BBC reported only those testing negative twice in succession will be able to travel home immediately, under plans due to be unveiled later on Wednesday by Richard Lochhead, the Scottish universities minister. The DfE said universities were expected to make plans to ensure students could travel home safely at the end of term, working with local public health officials and transport operators.
Universities UK, which speaks for 140 universities in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, said the government must now urgently turn its attention to working with the sector. “With universities being asked to end in-person learning by 9 December, some students will now miss out on timetabled placements, practical classes and other in-person teaching near the end of term. Universities will need to work with students and government to manage the challenges this creates,” said a spokesperson. Announcing the plans, Donelan said: “We know this Christmas will feel different, and following this incredibly difficult year we are delivering on our commitment to get students back to their loved ones as safely as possible for the holidays. “We have worked really hard to find a way to do this for students, while limiting the risk of transmission. Now it is vital they follow these measures to protect their families and communities, and for universities to make sure students have all the wellbeing support they need, especially those who stay on campus over the break.”
The Independent Sage committee of experts had warned in a report last week that without careful planning there were likely to be two new Covid-19 outbreaks as students travelled between towns and cities in the UK and internationally to go home for the Christmas break and to return again in the new year. If possible, it recommended that students should self-isolate and/or be tested – ideally twice – before returning home, as well as when at home. Testing capacity must be increased to enable this to happen, it said. A union representing academics and support staff said that the plans were welcome but were “riddled with holes” Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said: “Allowing just a week for around 1 million students to travel across the country leaves little room for error. If the government instead told universities to move online now it would provide much more time to stagger the movement of students and better protect the health of staff, students and their wider communities.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1939,Covid: Totnes concerns reflect UK-wide rise in conspiracy theories,11/11/20,"Like many people living in or around Totnes in Devon, David, who is in his 70s, has his own theories about coronavirus and its origins. Sitting in the armchair of his house, he says the pandemic is a secret plot to impose a totalitarian world government and a nefarious effort to crush freedom. He scrolls through Facebook, which he recently signed up to, to show many with similar beliefs. David came to many of these ideas recently. When the pandemic hit, he started looking for answers. “I’m friends with a few people who are active in researching what is going on. I quickly made contact with others putting posts on the internet.” He is strongly opposed to 5G, believing mobile phone signals either transmit the virus or reduce our defences to it, and has said he would not accept a vaccine as it would involve injecting nanoparticles into the body that would allow people to be controlled. While such views are not the norm, they can be found around the country, and MPs have warned that misinformation about the pandemic is spreading “virulently” because the UK still lacks a law to regulate social media. It is a problem that has come into sharp focus since the announcement that a Covid vaccine could be within reach, with trials finding a new jab to be 90% effective. Concern has been raised about the uptake of such a vaccine, or false rumours that might deter people from getting it. “Vaccine misinformation has been out there ever since the first vaccines were made,” said England’s deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam on Monday. “And it is exactly that, misinformation.”
People in Totnes are known for questioning “the mainstream narrative”, says its mayor, Jacqi Hodgson. The take-up for one dose of the MMR vaccine by five-year-olds was 78%, according to figures for 2018-19, well below the national target of 95%. Last year, campaigners persuaded the council to put a moratorium on the rollout of 5G after being inspired by the conspiracy theory that it is bad for your health. Since the start of the pandemic, leaflets about the dangers of wearing masks have been slipped through doors, a weekly meeting takes place to discuss theories about the origins of the virus and since August protesters have regularly appeared in the town centre. Hodgson says that some of those handing out leaflets encouraging people not to wear masks have become pushier. “They have been pushing leaflets on to people’s hands. One person insisted on giving me a leaflet and I said it was reckless not to encourage people to wear masks.” “People have been gathering more and more [since the start of the pandemic] … They were holding rallies on Saturday afternoon in the market square and upsetting the market traders.” The local council has even struggled to pedestrianise a part of the high street due to a backlash from those who believe the pandemic is a hoax. Peter Shearn, the editor of Totnes Pulse, a community not-for-profit magazine, said: “There is a Facebook group for locals and it has become very aggressive and bitey, with people arguing. What has happened is people who were behind QAnon narratives [a global movement claiming there is a secret satanic network of child-abusing politicians and celebrities] hold hands with the very far left. It’s sort of gone full circle.” One person who does not believe in wearing masks is Steve, who works as a psychotherapist. “Masks are used to maintain fear as it is obviously not a pandemic,” he says. “When you break the statistics down … the average age of death from the virus is over life expectancy. Mental health suffers, the economy is destroyed and we know what happens with economic downturns: people die.” A distrust of the scientific and governmental consensus on the pandemic can be seen nationally. A May study, funded by Oxford Health BRC, showed 60% of adults believe to some extent that the government was misleading the public about the cause of the virus. “We’re not just battling the virus,” said the WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in August. “We’re also battling the trolls and conspiracy theorists that push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response.” Earlier in the summer, residents of Totnes and others in the South Hams area, the district the town is in, reported having leaflets dropped through their doors promoting the idea that mask-wearing was detrimental to health. They argued that wearing masks was linked to too much carbon dioxide in the blood and a weakened immune system. Carole Boulanger, a consultant nurse from Royal Devon and Exeter NHS foundation trust, said that coronavirus was a “serious illness” that “people need to take seriously”. “There are people who think it’s manufactured and there is some big plot, but we have Covid-19 in the area, in the country and in the world. It is causing a lot of illness and mortality for the population,” she added. While the south-west has the lowest proportion of deaths of any area of England, infection rates have been rising in Devon since September, with 736 new cases between 1 and 7 November. There have been 5,935 cases in total. Boulanger said that there was frustration in the south-west because infection numbers were low, and people working in the area’s vast tourist industry had experienced a huge hit to businesses. However, she added there should also be caution due to the high number of older people in the area who are at risk from the virus. She said that there was also limited capacity in hospitals and the area would need to deal with normal winter pressures, as well as the virus this year, which meant people should take it seriously. “Most people I am in contact with have either got it or had it … or their relatives are in the intensive care unit with it. That is a poignant way of appreciating that this illness is fact and not a hoax.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1940,Delhi Covid crisis worsened by soaring pollution levels,11/11/20,"Delhi’s 20 million residents are facing a double health crisis as high levels of pollution look set to exacerbate the coronavirus pandemic. The twin threats have been looming over the city for the past week. After managing to get fresh daily infections under control last month, the city is witnessing its worst wave so far, recording a highest single day rise on Tuesday of 7,830 new cases. Equally off the charts is the catastrophic pollution that has wrapped the city in a poisonous shroud for the past week and which, doctors say, will weaken people’s lungs and render them even more vulnerable to the virus. The pollution is a replay of last year’s crisis. The sensors at the air quality monitoring stations can measure up to the value of 500. For the past six days, the index has reached 490. But a federal monitoring agency classified the air quality on Tuesday at 724. An air quality index (AQI) score of between zero and 50 is considered safe by the World Health Organization (WHO). The thick smog has blurred the city’s skyline. Residents complain of smarting eyes, coughing and difficulty breathing. Doctors have advised everyone to stay indoors if they can, particularly children and the elderly. In homes, the red “alert” lights have been blazing on even the most powerful air purifiers. It can take some time before the hazardous pollution is brought down to a tolerable level, only to shoot up again if anyone opens a door or window.
The reasons for the pollution are the same as last year and previous years: car emissions, burning of waste, construction dust, and the burning of farm stubble in neighbouring states. The weather, with not enough winds to disperse the pollutants, has made thing worse. Civil servant Ashish Narang has not ventured out for a week. “We were already confined indoors because of the pandemic but we could at least go for a walk with a mask but now we can’t do that either. How can our lungs stand a chance against the virus if they are already blackened and damaged by pollution?” he asked. Despite the crisis, the New Delhi government has given no indication that it is disturbed or alarmed, beyond announcing a ban on letting off firecrackers, a tradition during Diwali, which is on Saturday. Nor has any minister in Narendra Modi’s government made any comment on the poor air quality. Hospitals say there has been a rise in the number of people complaining of respiratory illnesses. “Increased pollution has led to a nearly 25% increase in respiratory problems,” said Dr Vivek Nangia, head of the Institute of Respiratory and Critical Care at Max Hospital. Owing to the acute shortage of beds due to Covid, he said the hospital was managing these cases via teleconsultation or the outpatients department. Studies have shown that lungs weakened by pollution are more vulnerable to coronavirus, suggesting that the city is facing a double disaster. The virus figures have been spiralling upwards and the New Delhi government shows no sign of being able to get them under control yet. This has come as a shock for residents because the city seemed to have turned the corner last month when daily infections had fallen to around 2,500. Quarantine centres were lying empty and hospital beds were easily available. The worst seemed over. All that has changed as restrictions have been relaxed. Markets are jam-packed with shoppers, most wearing masks but with no social distancing. Diwali is likely to see more movement and socialising. Hospitals are complaining of an acute shortage of beds and stories are once again doing the rounds of families having to drive around for hours looking for a hospital bed. The Indian Medical Association has said that 13% of the city’s recent Covid cases may be linked to air pollution.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1941,Dissatisfied Tory MPs flock to ERG-inspired pressure groups,11/11/20,"Conservative MPs who see the government as remote or lacking a policy agenda are flocking to backbench pressure groups in the hope of forcing Downing Street to listen to their concerns. After the success of the European Research Group in shaping Brexit policy, a string of new groups have been set up in recent months with a remit on issues from migration to criticism of “the woke agenda”. They claim they have their finger on the pulse of the subjects which voters in the party’s treasured new “red wall” seats care about. One MP who is a member of two of the new groups told the Guardian: “I would say we are ready for a culture war, and we are confident that our policy agenda will help win it.” The latest of the groups, the Covid Recovery Group (CRG), was announced on Tuesday and appears to pose the most direct threat of rebellion over the government’s policies on lockdown. It is led by the ERG veteran Steve Baker, who one member said was “the best whip in Westminster”. It launched with 50 members and at least 10 more have joined its ranks in the last 24 hours, the Guardian understands. The Common Sense Group, which launched quietly in the summer with about 40 members, was the subject of a front-page story in the Daily Telegraph this week after it accused the National Trust of being “coloured by cultural Marxist dogma” and in the grip of “elite bourgeois liberals” over a report acknowledging links between its properties and slavery. It now has 59 MPs and 7 members of the House of Lords in its ranks. Sir John Hayes, the founder of the group, told the Guardian: “The ERG has served an important role, but it has very largely done its work. The government has to decide what its defining purpose is beyond Brexit. There’s a thirst in the party to have an open debate about what the direction should be now. There’s a different kind of Conservative family emerging.” One member of the group, Jonathan Gullis, posted a “CULTURE WAR ALERT” on Facebook last month telling his followers that research by Greenwich Maritime Museum into the Royal Navy’s links to slavery was “leftwing ideological nonsense”. Members have met with Priti Patel to discuss their views on immigration. “We had a Zoom meeting with Priti within two or three days of forming, and I hope we did have some influence, help to shape the thinking,” Hayes said.
On Wednesday, members of the Northern Research Group (NRG) used a Westminster Hall debate to call on the government to set out a “northern economic recovery plan”. One member, Southport MP Damien Moore, told the minister Kemi Badenoch: “We can’t just hope our way out of this crisis.” Henry Hill, news editor at the Conservative Home website, said that the groups had formed because “whereas with Thatcher or Cameron you had a coherent ‘-ism’, with Johnson you don’t really have one of those. There are just whole areas of policy where Johnsonism isn’t a thing.” The CRG has been modelled on the ERG, which was tightly organised, commissioned in-depth reports, had official briefings for journalists and MPs, and employed a staff researcher who handled communications. The new group has already engaged the services of Ed Barker, a seasoned Tory PR professional and former parliamentary candidate who worked for the pro-Brexit group Global Britain and for Esther McVey’s short-lived leadership campaign. Ben Bradley, the MP for Mansfield, who was one of the first “red wall” group of Tories to be elected, in 2017, is a member of the Common Sense Group and the NRG. He said the spate of new groups reflected the priorities of a new kind of Tory MP, drawing comparisons with some of the thinktanks that emerged under Theresa May, like the free-market group Freer, and Onward, run by former May advisers Will Tanner and the MP Neil O’Brien.
“When we got in in 2017, there was this proliferation of new groups,” Bradley said. “In 2019, there are also a lot of new ideas coming from seats that have new priorities, levelling up the north, immigration. “This is a mechanism of getting that across. But this time there is senior leadership who are invested too, big guns on the backbenches like Jake Berry, around John Hayes in Common Sense, there’s Esther McVey in [another group] the Blue Collar Conservatives. It’s very much a 2019 viewpoint that has found a wider reception.” Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, cautioned against groups “being amplified because if a mouthy backbencher is said to represent something it lends them legitimacy”. But he said the “turning of the page” from Brexit had helped create space for such voices. “The energy almost needed somewhere else to go within this closed system,” he said, noting of the CRG that “the journey from Euroscepticism to lockdown scepticism is fairly easy ”. A Tory MP who is part of the CRG said that the new groupings were all viewed as “adversarial” by Downing Street. “The fundamental reason for this is that No 10 is so dominant,” they said. “It’s clear that if you want to be heard, you have to shout. Johnson has no views beyond Brexit. We’re in a particularly odd place where access is limited to a very narrow faction and so it’s hardly surprising if real conservatives are trying to find a way to act.” Some backbenchers on the left of the party are concerned about a new factionalism. One who is aligned with the One Nation Group of soft-right Conservatives said they feared the emergence of multiple “parties within a party”. The MP added: “I’m wary of some of these endeavours, given the grief they wrought on the party last year. But it should be said that you don’t have to be a headbanger to think that the sphere of influence in No 10 is too small and that groups that put pressure on things that Tory voters care about is not necessarily a bad thing.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1942,Emma Thompson backs launch of UK political fund for women,11/11/20,"A political support fund for women that aims to emulate the success of the influential Emily’s List in the US has launched with the financial backing of actor Emma Thompson. Announcing the first list of candidates from the Activate Collective, Thompson said women, particularly women of colour, disabled women and women on low income, needed financial backing to overcome multiple barriers to entering politics.
“Our political system was built for men who – generally – had women to do everything else for them – caring for the elderly and the infirm, sustaining the domestic environment and all the endless and unpaid work that that entails,” said Thompson, who donated £50,000 to kickstart the first round. “We need women from all backgrounds and experiences to get elected in order to make the system work for most people and not just a few.” Sophie Walker, former leader of the Women’s Equality party, who co-founded the fund with former special adviser Vanessa Pine said it hoped to emulate the success of groups such as Emily’s List, which backs pro-choice Democratic female candidates for office in the US. “One of the things I discovered as a total novice politician, was the extent to which the amount of money you have makes a difference to the extent to which your voice can be heard,” she said. “I feel very strongly that there is a massive dearth of women’s voices in politics, and that we particularly need to support women from minoritised communities.” According to research by the organisation, less than a third of MPs are women in the UK, while black and minority ethnic (BAME) women make up 4% of MPs, compared with 6.5% of the population. Just two female MPs identify as disabled. There are no female metro mayors, while nine in 10 seats in devolved cabinets are occupied by men. Walker and Pine paid tribute to the #AskHerToStand campaign by 50:50 Parliament, but said that without practical and financial support women would struggle to succeed. Activate, which receives funding from the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, has also created a Community Activist Fund to form a pipeline for future candidates, and is working with academics to research the barriers to better representation. Its first list of candidates includes Labour’s Jessie Joe Jacobs, who hopes to become England’s first metro mayor in Tees Valley, Mandu Reid, Women’s Equality party candidate for London mayor and Molly Samuel-Leport, Conservative candidate for the Greater London Assembly. The list includes eight women of colour, one disabled woman and one care leaver, while seven of the 11 identify as working class.
“As a black woman, I don’t see or think there are enough people from my background in politics,” said Molly Samuel-Leport, who is standing for the London assembly. “Without this financial support or encouragement for women like me, none of this would be possible.” With the UK facing an uncertain future and women at risk of facing the sharp end of an economic downturn, the need for more women in parliament was more pressing than ever, said Walker. “At a time when politicians are really scrambling to get answers to the vast questions we are facing about how we support different communities, how we balance work and family life, how we support carers … we need these different perspectives and solutions injected into our politics,” she said.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1943,EU seeks greater public health powers after Covid 'wake-up call',11/11/20,"Brussels is seeking a major shift in powers towards the EU’s health agencies, warning that Europe’s faltering approach to the coronavirus pandemic has caused “confusion and distrust”. The EU commissioner for health, Stella Kyriakides, said the bloc’s lack of readiness for the crisis had meant substandard care for patients and left medics without access to vital resources. At the height of the first wave of the pandemic, the Italian government hit out at the lack of solidarity within the EU after its urgent calls for medical resources from fellow European governments were ignored. Kyriakides, a former MP in Cyprus who is also a psychologist with a degree from Reading University, said she believed the pandemic had been a “wake-up call” to EU capitals. She said: “We have seen in the beginning of this crisis how fragmentation can make member states more vulnerable. We saw that in the beginning, in the first few weeks, the effects of uncoordinated national measures. There was a lack of readiness and preparation. “And we saw that with the shortfall of medical equipment, testing capacity and coordination in many areas. So this uncoordinated approach, what it directly means is that citizens don’t get the best healthcare. “It means they don’t have the access that they should have to the medicines they need, to the medical devices and the medical equipment they may need.” Under a new regulation on serious cross-border threats to health proposed by the European commission on Wednesday, EU member states would be obliged to report on the capacities of their healthcare systems, while national crisis plans would be scrutinised by the bloc’s officials for weaknesses. The EU would establish a strengthened surveillance system using artificial intelligence to watch out for any outbreaks of disease or weaknesses in healthcare capacity within its territory.
An entirely new organisation modelled on the US biomedical research and development authority will also be formed by 2023 to build up stockpiles of key medicines and equipment. The Health Emergency Response Authority (Hera) will be tasked with developing a “surge capacity” in production for times when raw materials from outside of Europe might be scarce. In the past, the bloc’s member states have resisted greater EU powers in the area of health. Most recently leaders cut heavily into the commission’s spending proposals on medical research and resilience for the next seven-year EU budget. Kyriakides said she was confident that there had been a realisation of the need for more EU involvement in coordination of the member states’ responses to health emergencies. “We fully respect member states’ competences for health system but Covid-19 is a wake-up for everyone,” the commissioner said. “Viruses know no borders, and other health threats know no borders. Citizens expect the EU to take a more active role in the area of health, to take a more active role in protecting them. They have been asking Europe to be more present in the area of public health. From the beginning of this crisis I have said this many times: this is a necessity. We need more EU in the area of public health.” As part of its “health union” package, the commission is proposing a major revamp for the Swedish-based European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to allow it to collect and analyse the level of preparedness for a crisis in the member states. During the pandemic, the ECDC was only able to offer technical guidance but it will in future make recommendations for the EU as a whole to adopt. The agency will also be responsible for auditing national crisis response plans. It will deploy a pool of experts to member states when help is needed. The European medicine agency will be empowered to track potential shortages of medicines and medical devices.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1944,EU summit on 19 November seen as deadline for draft Brexit deal,11/11/20,"A summit of EU leaders on 19 November is now viewed in Brussels as the final deadline for a draft Brexit deal, with negotiations on Britain’s future trade and security relationship with the bloc set to go to the wire. Negotiators working in London had hoped to be able to pass on a deal to MEPs for scrutiny by 18 November to allow time for parliamentary ratification but the talks remain difficult, according to sources on both sides. Next Thursday’s video conference summit of the 27 heads of state and government, arranged to discuss the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic, is being seen as a key moment in the Brexit saga. “If there isn’t good news by then, then you really have to say that time is up – it just isn’t possible,” said one senior EU diplomat. “The leaders will need to see that it is there.” A final arbitration session between Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is also a possibility should the negotiators move closer to each other’s positions on the outstanding issues. The thorniest problems to resolve remain the level of access to UK waters provided to EU fishing fleets, how to maintain fair competition rules for business – including rules on domestic subsidies – and the mechanism in the final treaty for resolving future disputes. UK sources have complained that Brussels has as yet failed to show enough “realism” about the scale of the change to the level of fishing opportunities the EU member states’ fleet will have in Britain’s exclusive economic zone from next year. On ensuring a “level playing field” for businesses in the UK and the EU, progress is being made on how the two sides’ domestic subsidy regimes would operate but difficulties remain in establishing a mechanism whereby a baseline of environmental, labour and social standards would develop in tandem for both sides. Downing Street has insisted the UK needs to be able to diverge its rulebook, while the EU has said it will not grant a “zero tariff, zero quota” deal if British companies are not operating under rules that are at least equivalent to those set by Brussels. A UK source said: “We have a different view from the EU on what is appropriate on level playing field issues. We have been clear that we can look at common principles for our different subsidy systems and perhaps even at the ability to act if a major subsidy genuinely distorts trade. “What we can’t agree to are arrangements which would require us to operate systems of laws equivalent to the EU’s and make us pay a penalty if we moved away from them. We need policy space to decide what is in the UK’s interest in the future. That is the very essence of what Brexit is about.” Despite the difficulties, the prime minister said on Sunday that a trade and security deal was “there to be done” and that the broad outline was already “pretty clear”. Johnson spoke to Von der Leyen on Saturday. The sliding Brexit timeline will be a cause for concern in the European parliament, where MEPs had insisted they would need to have the agreement in front of them by next Monday to start the ratification process. It was hoped that the parliament would vote on the deal on 16 December. Sources in the European parliament said an extraordinary sitting of the chamber may need to be arranged for 28 December – three days before the end of the transition period when the UK leaves the single market and customs union. Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said he believed a deal would be struck despite the differences between the two sides. He said: “I think we may well be likely to go into next week on these negotiations. We’re not there yet. What I would say is the UK government understand only too well what’s needed for an agreement here. I don’t believe the EU ask is unreasonable and the EU also needs to show some compromise to accommodate many British asks. “If we can overcome those issues, in particular fish which is very emotive and very political then I think we can get a deal done. If we can’t get a deal done it will represent an extraordinary failure of politics and diplomacy.””",,Politics,Guardian,5
1945,Europe can't afford to lose another generation to youth unemployment,11/11/20,"A decade ago, the global financial crisis left deep scars in terms of destroyed opportunities and unemployment for young people. In Europe in particular, youth unemployment persisted. Now the Covid-19 crisis threatens to do the same thing to the under-25s. Yet, none of the leaders of France, Italy or Spain, nor the president of the European commission, prioritised youth unemployment in their latest policy speeches. At the highest political level, the focus must be on averting the risk of a lost generation. Bold policies will be needed. During the financial crisis, the US youth unemployment rate increased from about 10% to 19%, while in the European Union it increased from 16% to 26%. The rate in the EU only returned to its 2008 level in 2018, while the spike in US youth unemployment was overcome more rapidly. Even in the recovery, some EU countries fared much worse than the EU average. In Greece, Spain and Italy, youth unemployment in 2019 was still higher than it was before the 2008 crash. Another major surge in youth unemployment brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic could also take a decade or more to heal. The first signs are already visible: US youth unemployment was about twice as high in July as in July 2019. In Europe, youth unemployment has increased by less, but still increased from 15% to more than 17% in the first two quarters of 2020 – while unemployment among the over-55s actually fell. More worryingly, measures of labour market slack are up by some five percentage points, as are the percentages of young people who have even given up searching for a job. Some countries such as Spain or Croatia have been more severely hit. In fact, Spanish youth unemployment increased from a high 32% to almost 40% while the Croatian rate increased from 17% to 24%. In the UK, youth unemployment rose from 11% to almost 14%. With Europe in its second significant lockdown, the risk is that these numbers will rapidly deteriorate further. Youth unemployment does long-term damage. Workers who are unemployed when young tend to earn significantly less over their lifetime. The young unemployed look at the future less optimistically. They also tend to leave the parental home later and start families later. On average, Italians leave their parents’ home only at the age of about 30, and it is no surprise that the Italian and Spanish fertility rates are among the lowest in Europe. In short, Europe cannot afford to again forget its youth. The European institutions must contribute to the effort to avoid another lost generation, and national policymakers in particular need to do their bit. The first big priority is to get the European macroeconomic policy stance right. One of the reasons for the slow recovery in youth employment in the EU after the financial crisis was the second recession that Europe fell into between 2011 and 2013. At the time, fiscal and monetary tightening prematurely choked off the recovery. So far in the response to Covid-19, European policymakers have not repeated that mistake and have provided impressive fiscal and monetary support. Fiscal policies will need to continue to support the EU economy in 2022 and 2023. Second, policymakers need to set up targeted support programmes for the hiring and retention of young workers. The European commission has pledged that €22bn from the EU recovery fund will be used to support youth employment. But such funding for the EU’s three million young unemployed is insufficient. National policymakers will need to increase their budget lines to support the hiring of young people and the creation of job opportunities. Third, 10 years ago, and despite pledges to the contrary, education and investment funding and spending on families was cut in many parts of Europe at the expense of the young. This time needs to be different. School closures have meant pupils missing out on teaching, affecting their lifetime earnings expectations. In particular, children from families with weak educational backgrounds have not been able to make up the loss of teaching. In that way, inequalities in opportunity have been further exacerbated. Many European countries are now paying a heavy price for their slowness in the digitalisation of schools and even universities. For instance, many German schools, after more than half a year of Covid-19, have not yet been able to put in place proper online teaching systems. Massive increases in public debt are shielding business from bankruptcy, and to preserve economic structures. But if Europe wants to stay competitive, it needs to invest more in the economy of the future. There is no better investment than investment in Europe’s young people, who continue to suffer disproportionately from this pandemic.

1946,France pays tribute to six-year-old resistance hero Marcel Pinte,11/11/20,"France has paid tribute to a six-year-old boy regarded as its youngest resistance hero, as part of the nationwide Armistice Day ceremonies in memory of those who died in the first and second world wars. In a special ceremony, the name of Marcel Pinte was inscribed on the war memorial of Aixe-sur-Vienne, just west of the central city of Limoges. Marcel, known as Quinquin after a children’s song, acted as a courier for resistance fighters who opposed the Nazi occupation during the second world war, slipping past enemy patrols and carrying messages under his shirt. His father, Eugene Pinte, was a local chief of the “army of the shadows” led from London by Charles de Gaulle, who set up an operations centre at a farm outside Aixe-sur-Vienne. His farmhouse received coded messages from London, and parachute drops of supplies in a field nearby. Marcel died, aged just six, on 19 August 1944, when a large deployment of resistance fighters arrived by parachute ahead of an expected battle around Aixe as allied forces began to liberate France. They were heavily armed and Marcel was hit by several bullets when a Sten submachine gun went off accidentally. “People who pass by this monument to the dead will notice his name and particularly his age,” said a family member, Marc Pinte. “It’s an honour. It throws a light on those who remained in the shadow but who fought for freedom.”
Several days after Marcel’s death, containers fell in the field in a final drop, but the parachutes were black. “The British knew that the little Marcel played a real role. This parachute was the calling card sent to the family,” Pinte told Le Monde. In 1950, Marcel was posthumously awarded the rank of sergeant of the resistance. In 2013, he posthumously received an official card for “volunteer combatants of the resistance” from the National Office of Former Combatants and War Victims.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1947,Government review urges major overhaul of capital gains tax,11/11/20,"A tax raid on buy-to-let properties and other forms of wealth could raise up to £14bn to help repair the government’s battered finances, after a report commissioned by the chancellor recommended a major overhaul of capital gains tax. Flagging a tax squeeze on the well-off to help pay for coronavirus, the maximum capital gains tax (CGT) rate of 28% could be raised by Rishi Sunak closer to income tax rates, where the top rates are 40% and 45% in England and Wales.
Under the proposals, there could also be deep cuts in the profits that share investors can make without paying tax, and other technical adjustments that could, in effect, push up inheritance tax bills. The findings of the review come as the coronavirus pandemic has pushed Britain’s national debt to more than £2tn, or more than 100% of GDP, as spending has soared and tax receipts have collapsed dramatically. The budget deficit – the annual shortfall between spending and tax income – is expected to balloon to reach than £400bn this year, amid forecasts that the pandemic will push the country into a double-dip recession. The proposals are contained in a report from the Office of Tax Simplification, which was set up by the former chancellor, George Osborne, and was asked by Sunak in July to compare CGT with other taxes and make proposals in order to iron out distortions. The changes called for by the OTS are similar to plans laid out by the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn ahead of the 2019 election, as part of proposed reforms to reduce soaring levels of wealth inequality in the UK. About £8.3bn of capital gains tax was paid in 2017-18, compared with £180bn of income tax by 31.2 million individual taxpayers. Bill Dodwell, tax director of the OTS, said: “If the government considers the simplification priority is to reduce distortions to behaviour, it should consider either more closely aligning capital gains tax rates with income tax rates, or addressing boundary issues as between capital gains tax and income tax.”
Currently there are four different rates of CGT. For basic rate income tax payers, the CGT levy is 18% on second homes and buy to lets, and 10% on other assets. For higher rate taxpayers, the rates are 28% and 20% respectively. The OTS said: “A rough static costing suggests that alignment of CGT rates with income tax rates could theoretically raise an additional £14bn a year for the exchequer.” However, it also noted that the final figure could be substantially less, due to “behavioural effects” such as people choosing to delay the sale of a property. The OTS stressed it was not calling for higher taxes, as setting rates was government policy. Landlords who have made large profits since investing in buy to let in the mid-1990s would likely to be among the big losers from any rise in CGT. However, rather than triggering a CGT charge by selling a buy to let, landlords may instead choose to hold on to the property. Alternatively, there could also be a rush to sell before higher CGT rates come in. The annual CGT allowance, called the annual exempt amount (AEA), could also be under threat. The allowance means that the first £12,300 of profits from trading in shares and property is currently free of CGT. But the OTS said the government “should consider reducing its level” to between £2,000 and £4,000. The report said: “The AEA clearly distorted investment decisions. Around 50,000 people report gains annually close to the threshold and so ‘use up’ the annual exempt amount as if it were an allowance – which is particularly easy for holders of listed share portfolios.” Robert Palmer, the executive director of Tax Justice UK, said polling by the campaign group had found Britons would support higher levies on wealth. “A hedge fund manager earning millions from their wealth should pay higher tax rates than a nurse. But the current rules mean some people earning millions can get away with rates as low as 10%,” he said. “As we build back from coronavirus, this should be a no-brainer for Rishi Sunak.” The Resolution Foundation urged the government to raise £40bn by launching a health and social care levy and imposing a windfall tax on pandemic profits to fix the public finances after the Covid-19 outbreak recedes. It said a special tax to pay for the health service would consist of a 4% annual flat tax rate on all incomes, including capital gains, over £12,500. There would be offsets for people earning below £19,500. A pandemic profits levy of 10% on supra-normal profits of the small minority of firms that have done better than normal in 2020, such as big technology firms, could also be used to raise raising a one-off £130m. Warning that the government was on track for a £400bn deficit this year, the thinktank said wealth taxes should also be used in response, and that corporation tax should also be increased to raise billions of pounds for the exchequer. However, it called on the chancellor to delay the task of repairing the public finances until the economy has fully recovered from the pandemic – expected to be 2023 at the earliest – to avoid the mistakes made following the 2008 financial crisis when George Osborne undermined the recovery by launching a decade-long austerity drive.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1948,GPs in England will scale back care to deliver Covid vaccines,11/11/20,"GP services will be cut back well into 2021 so family doctors can immunise millions of people against coronavirus at new seven-day-a-week clinics, NHS England has said. Health leaders warned that surgeries will not be able to offer their full range of care for patients from next month as doctors and nurses will be immersed in administering jabs at more than 1,200 mass vaccination centres across England, potentially including sports halls, conference centres and open air venues. It came as Britain reported 532 new deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test on Tuesday, the highest daily figure since May. Some 20,412 people tested positive for Covid-19, down slightly from the previous day.
While Covid vaccinations are seen as crucial for allowing a gradual return to normality, there are growing concerns about pressure on an already stretched NHS and the toll on patients after much normal care was suspended during the first wave of the pandemic. The Department of Health and Social Care has asked the NHS to be ready to deliver the vaccines by 1 December, but the Guardian understands it is unlikely any programme will be ready to roll out by then. New research by the Health Foundation, published today, found that 4.7 million fewer people in England than usual were referred for a hip or knee replacement or cataract removal between January and August this year, with services closed and patients reluctant to attend hospital. On Monday the first potential Covid-19 vaccine yielded promising interim results, with global trials showing 90% effectiveness. Britain has bought 40m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, enough to immunise 20m people with two doses each, and hopes to begin rolling them out to the elderly and health care and care home workers within weeks.
NHS England has agreed with the British Medical Association that family doctors will play the lead role in a vaccination drive of a scale and complexity unprecedented in the NHS’s 73-year history, described by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, as a “mammoth logistical operation”. In a letter to GP leaders confirming the deal, NHS chiefs accept that GP surgeries cannot operate as usual while their doctors are engaged in the immunisation effort. “We also recognise that the additional workload of a Covid-19 vaccination programme may require practices to prioritise clinical activity,” wrote Dr Nikki Kanani, NHS England’s medical director for primary care. GPs will open at least 1,260 mass vaccination centres across England, 12 hours a day, seven days a week. They will be paid £12.58 each time they or a practice nurse administers one of the two doses every recipient will be expected to have, several weeks apart, of whichever vaccines have been approved by European and British medicines regulators – hoped to include the Pfizer/BioNTech candidate. At least 975 people a week will have one dose at every site. Hancock announced on Tuesday that primary care services are to be given £150m to help them hire more GPs and expand the help they give patients affected by the disease, including those suffering from “long Covid”. It is unknown how much on top of that GPs will receive for dispensing Covid jabs. However, doctors’ leaders voiced concern that the NHS does not have enough staff or infrastructure, such as freezers to store vaccines and lorries to transport them, and could become embroiled in the sort of “desperate scramble” for kit seen in the spring with personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators. The head of the Royal College of GPs told the Guardian that widespread shortages of family doctors and the existing strain on surgeries meant hospital doctors would also have to help out. Under new laws announced by the government, a wider range of healthcare workers – including midwives, paramedics, physiotherapists and pharmacists – are to be allowed to give flu and potentially Covid-19 vaccines. “The workload and resource pressures that were facing general practice before the pandemic still exist, and they need to be addressed. GPs and our teams won’t be able to deliver this programme alone,” said Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the college. “We will need the support of other healthcare professionals in the community, and potentially from secondary [hospital] care colleagues, such as those delivering outpatient services.” GPs also need “clarity on what work we should stop doing in order to create capacity to deliver the Covid vaccination programme”, he added. Dr Nick Scriven, a past president of the Society of Acute Medicine, which represents hospital doctors, said NHS bosses and ministers will have to overcome “a series of challenges” to ensure the vaccine rollout succeeds. “This is very complex stuff. Two jabs, three weeks apart, with people having to recover somewhere for 15 minutes after they have it – that is far more complex than administering the winter flu jab. “This is an unprecedented undertaking for the NHS and the country. The NHS doesn’t have the kit and logistics to do this today. But it will be able to do it with enough notice. The sheer logistics may mean that the rollout of the vaccine takes longer than people imagine and expect. Perhaps that’s why Boris Johnson on Monday was urging people not to get too carried away.” Ruth Rankine, director of the Primary Care Network at the NHS Confederation, said patients having less access to GP care because of the immunisation initiative was unavoidable. “Delivery of a vaccination programme on this scale from scratch means business as usual is not feasible, so public expectations will need to be managed at a national level.” However, a senior Whitehall official said getting the vaccine to where it is needed should not pose problems because NHS England has spent months arranging cold storage transport vehicles. “That stuff definitely is happening,” the source said. Richard Wilding, a professor of supply chain strategy at Cranfield University, said the NHS would need to acquire significant amounts of dry ice to to store and transport vaccines, as well as specialist containers of sufficiently low temperature. It would also need plentiful supplies of freezers, syringes, needles and PPE for those administering them, he added. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has put NHS England in charge of overseeing delivery of the vaccine, which will be expanded next year to the rest of the population. That means that, unlike the sourcing of PPE and ventilators when the pandemic hit, NHS England is responsible for ensuring the drive has enough resources. It is due to publish its deployment plan next week. A DHSC spokesperson said: “The NHS has vast experience delivering widespread vaccination programmes and an enormous amount of planning has taken place to ensure our health service stands ready to roll out a Covid-19 vaccine. “This includes putting in place logistical expertise, transport, PPE and an expanded workforce to ensure we can deploy vaccines rapidly once they have met robust standards on safety and effectiveness and been approved by the medicines regulator.” On Wednesday the European commission will formally authorise for EU member states the purchase of 300m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1949,Harry Dunn death: family begins court case against Foreign Office,11/11/20,"The family of Harry Dunn, the 19-year-old motorcyclist killed outside a US airbase, have begun their court case seeking a ruling that the Foreign Office acted unlawfully in granting diplomatic immunity to the American driver of the car that killed him. Dunn was killed when his motorbike crashed into a car being driven on the wrong side of the road by Anne Sacoolas outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August last year. Sacoolas, whose husband, Jonathan Sacoolas, worked as a technical assistant at the base, left the country two weeks later after the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) accepted a US claim that Sacoolas had immunity on the basis that her husband worked at RAF Croughton, a CIA listening post in Northamptonshire. Subsequent UK government efforts to seek her extradition have been rejected by the US Department of State. The claim for immunity turns on a secret agreement signed between the UK and the US that gave immunity to the staff working at RAF Croughton but only for activities in relation to their work. It was silent on the immunity status of the families of staff. The Foreign Office and the US state department interpreted the silence in the agreement as giving families full immunity. Lawyers acting for Dunn’s family claim it is a perverse interpretation of the agreement to suggest that staff members at the US base had less diplomatic immunity than their family. The FCDO argued that the silence in the secret agreement about the status of staff families was an anomaly, but nevertheless gave these family members immunity. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, subsequently announced that “the US waiver of immunity from criminal jurisdiction is now expressly extended to the family members of US staff” at the base, “ending the anomaly in the previous arrangements”. The Crown Prosecution Service has charged Sacoolas with death by dangerous driving, and sought her extradition. Lawyers acting for the Dunn family argue that the FCDO breached human rights law by advising Northamptonshire police that Sacoolas had immunity and then keeping key facts from the police, including her imminent departure from the UK. Sacoolas has acknowledged that she was driving on the wrong side of the road when she hit Dunn. She had only been in the UK for a few weeks when the collision happened. The two-day judicial review by remote video link is in front of Lord Justice Flaux and Justice Saini. Representing the family, Geoffrey Robertson QC said: “Since family members are not members of the mission and they have no duties, Anne Sacoolas was never entitled to any derivative or implied immunity from criminal jurisdiction.” He added that it would be “absurd” for family members to have “greater privileges and immunities” than the staff at RAF Croughton “from whom their immunity flows”. In written submissions, the FCDO’s barrister Sir James Eadie QC said: “As a matter of international and domestic law, Mrs Sacoolas automatically had diplomatic immunity as the spouse of a member of the administrative and technical staff of the US mission.” He argued the FCDO “plainly did not obstruct the police investigation”, adding: “On the contrary, the secretary of state sought to assist the police investigation, including by requesting a waiver of Mrs Sacoolas’s immunity.” Sir James told the court the US “expressly waived the immunity from the UK’s criminal jurisdiction of ‘employees’ or ‘staff members’, but that “at no point is there a waiver of the immunity enjoyed by the families of such individuals”. But Roberston argued that the FCDO “took upon itself the authority to resolve the question of immunity and ultimately and unlawfully decided to accept the US embassy’s decision that Anne Sacoolas had immunity”. He said in written submissions that the decision “obstructed the police by preventing any effective further progress in its investigation into Harry’s death and likely prosecution of Anne Sacoolas”. Robertson argued the FCDO “tacitly accepted the Sacoolas family’s departure from the UK”, referring to a text message sent to a US embassy official on 14 September 2019 – a day before Sacoolas and her family left the UK. The message read: “I think that now the decision has been taken not to waive [immunity], there’s not much mileage in us asking you to keep the family here. “It’s obviously not us approving of their departure but I think you should be able to put them on the next flight out.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1950,How will a coronavirus vaccine be rolled out to the UK population?,11/11/20,"The NHS is ramping up to deliver the most important vaccination programme for decades, a mammoth task that is aimed at protecting tens of millions of people against coronavirus. But with several vaccines potentially on the verge of being approved by regulators, how will the UK manage the rollout?
Who is first in line for vaccination? The joint committee on vaccination and immunisation (JCVI) advise government on vaccination policy. Its interim recommendations are to prioritise older adults in care homes and care workers, followed by all those aged 80 and over, and health and social care workers. Next in line are the over-75s, then the over-70s, and so on down the age groups, as more vaccine shots become available. Can people take more than one Covid vaccine? The interim results from Pfizer this week suggest that its two-shot vaccine, developed with the German firm BioNTech, is 90% effective. The figure is based on 94 Covid cases across both vaccinated and placebo arms of the trial. More data is needed to confirm this level of protection and that is expected within weeks when Pfizer runs another analysis based on 164 infected trial volunteers. If the vaccine is proven to achieve such a high level of protection, there is no reason why someone would need a different, additional vaccine on top. However, whether people can safely have different Covid vaccines is an important question for scientists to answer. It has not been looked at yet, because the immediate priority is to find individual vaccines that are safe and effective on their own. If they can safely be used in combination, it could make rollout easier, because it wouldn’t matter which vaccine is given as the first or second shot. Although the multiple vaccines in development are based on a number of different technologies many, including the frontrunners from Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca, stimulate the immune system to generate T cells and antibodies against the same coronavirus spike protein. If these vaccines produce similar immune reactions and achieve similar levels of protection, they could potentially be used interchangeably. Would having more than one vaccine give you more immunity? Trials have yet to look at the impact of using Covid vaccines in combination and it is unknown whether doing so would improve people’s protection against the virus. Some vaccines in development use the whole virus, and these are expected to produce different immune responses to those that rely on only the spike protein to stimulate the body’s defences. Using these in combination might produce an overall more robust immune response. But such combinations would have to be assessed for safety and efficacy in further trials. Some Covid vaccines may need booster shots to sustain immunity and scientists need to study whether that can be done with different products. What do we still need to know about the Pfizer vaccine? While encouraging, the results so far from Pfizer are preliminary. More safety data is expected soon. Important questions about the vaccine’s efficacy remain too. It is not yet known whether the virus prevents severe infections or just mild ones. Nor is it clear whether the vaccine prevents people from spreading the virus, if it is as effective in older people as well as younger people, and no one knows how long any protection lasts. When will the rest of the population get a vaccine? The first task is to immunise as soon as possible all those in the 10 groups identified by the JCVI. Together they comprise an estimated 22 million people. Besides care home residents, they include all health and care staff, the 2.2 million people on the shielding list classed as “extremely clinically vulnerable”, and then everyone aged 50 and over. This is “phase one” of the rollout. If the vaccine is delayed until early 2021, it will be even later before the general public get the jab. Each of these 22 million people will need two doses, and because the NHS hopes to immunise 1 million people a week, everyone else is unlikely to be able to get a jab until the middle of next year at the earliest. This is “phase two” of the rollout. How long it will be before the general public can get immunised also depends on whether the JCVI, the government and NHS decide to vaccinate under-18s. That is being discussed but no decision has yet been taken. Further discussions are afoot on how else people may be prioritised, and there could be different priority groups for different vaccines. This is similar to what is seen with influenza vaccines, where older and more vulnerable adults get a killed virus vaccine while younger people get a live, weakened virus vaccine.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1951,Hungarian government mounts new assault on LGBT rights,11/11/20,"Moments before Hungary entered a second coronavirus lockdown on Wednesday, the far-right government signalled its intention to pass a range of new legislation, including to make it harder for opposition political parties to join forces and to change the constitution to enshrine the defence of so-called “Christian values”. Opposition politicians criticised both the substance and timing of the moves. The proposed constitutional amendment, submitted to parliament by the justice minister, Judit Varga, late on Tuesday, is the latest assault on LGBT rights in the country, where legal recognition for gender changes was ended in May. “Hungary protects children’s right to identify as the sex they were born with, and ensures their upbringing based on our national self-identification and Christian culture,” the amendment states. The constitution already stipulates that marriage must be between a man and a woman, but the amendment says that in a parent-child relationship “the mother is a woman and the father is a man”. The amendment would ensure that only heterosexual married couples can adopt children. Single people could gain exemptions by special ministerial permission. The attempted justification for the amendment explains that “new, modern ideologies in the western world raise doubt about the creation of the male and female sex, and endanger the right of children to have healthy development.” The Hungarian language has the same word for sex and gender. For years, Viktor Orbán’s government has relied on an anti-migration agenda to rally its base, and some analysts suggest LGBT people may be the new target. In Poland, the ruling populist Law and Justice (PiS) party has made the fight against so-called “LGBT ideology” central to its political messaging. Orbán’s government is facing pressure arising from discussions in the EU to link the disbursal of some European funds to rule of law criteria, as well as pressure over rising coronavirus cases. The new lockdown includes an 8pm curfew and the closure of restaurants and bars. Parliament has voted for a 90-day “state of emergency” during which the government can issue decrees on virus-related matters without parliamentary approval. The timing of the new legislative initiatives, which were announced with no warning, was reminiscent of an earlier barrage of legislation unrelated to coronavirus that was introduced during the first coronavirus “state of emergency” in the spring. The independent MP Bernadett Szél wrote on Facebook that “instead of fighting the virus, they wish to fight the LGBT community”. Katalin Cseh, an MEP of the opposition Momentum party, wrote on Twitter: “Parents, schools, hospitals, small businesses are hours away from a lockdown – not knowing what will happen, as details of regulations haven’t even been published yet. On the govt’s agenda: a constitutional amendment to fight gender ideology.” The new laws will have to be debated in parliament, but Orbán’s Fidesz party has a two-thirds majority, sufficient to make constitutional amendments. While the gender-related initiatives are the most eye-catching, the political changes could also prove significant. The new rules would make it harder for parties to run joint lists in elections without fully uniting. Fidesz has dominated Hungarian politics over the past decade, but the fragmented opposition has had success in mayoral elections – including in Budapest – when unifying behind a single candidate. Opposition parties had announced their intention to run unity candidates against Fidesz in parliamentary elections in 2022. “Viktor Orbán has become unworthy of his office once and for all,” six opposition parties said in a statement on Wednesday, Reuters reported. “This only goes to show that he no longer feels safe even in the election system he wrote for himself, which is fitting because he will lose.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1952,Hurricane Eta leaves trail of destruction in Central America,11/11/20,"The active north Atlantic hurricane season continued through last week with Hurricane Eta making landfall as a category 4 storm to the south of Puerto Cabezas in Nicaragua. The storm weakened as it moved slowly inland towards Honduras through the week. Some areas saw as much as 550mm of rain (22 inches), leading to landslides and flooding. At least 100 people have died as a result. Spain and Portugal also had some anomalously high rainfall totals last week as low pressure lingered nearby. Eastern Spain was particularly wet with Valencia getting 100mm on 5 November, compared with the November monthly average of just 37mm. Flash flooding followed, leading to the suspension of schools and road closures. Wind and hail also damaged and estimated €8m (£7m) worth of crops. Across large parts of the US, it was notably warm for the time of year last week with cities such as Denver, Boston, Minneapolis and Chicago surpassing 20C on numerous days. Temperatures of 26C and 25C in Denver on 3 and 4 November respectively broke daily records for the city, which extend back to 1872.

1953,Inquiry raises concerns over how £3.6bn towns fund was distributed,11/11/20,"An inquiry by parliament’s spending watchdog into how ministers distributed £3.6bn to help deprived towns has raised serious concerns that funding decisions were politically biased. The cross-party public accounts committee said it was “not convinced by the rationales for selecting some towns and not others” when the towns fund was distributed by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, (MHCLG) last year. Justifications offered by ministers for selecting individual towns were “vague and based on sweeping assumptions” and raised concerns over the decisions being politically motivated, the committee said. The highly critical report comes after the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, earlier this year denied having any role in selecting his constituency, Newark, for a £25m grant under the scheme, despite having boasted about it during last year’s general election. Jenrick said the award had been signed off by the then communities minister Jake Berry, while he had approved a grant for Darwen in Berry’s constituency. Meg Hillier, chair of the committee, said the system gave “every appearance of having been politically motivated”. “MHCLG must be open and transparent about the decisions it made to hand out those billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money, and what it expects to deliver,” she said. The scheme was originally launched “at pace” in July 2019 to support struggling towns across England. Officials in the department then drew up a ranked priority list of 541 towns based on need and potential for development for ministers to select from. While the top 40 “high priority” locations were all confirmed, ministers then picked another 61 “medium and low priority” communities from across the rest of the list including one ranked just 536th. Although the department was supposed to record the “rationale” for choosing some towns and not others, the committee said it was “not convinced” by some of the reasons given. “The selection process was not impartial,” they concluded. The committee also complained that the reasons given by the department for not publishing more information about the selection process were “weak and unconvincing”. It said concerns had been heightened by press statements which wrongly claimed the National Audit Office had concluded that its procedures were “robust”. While the department’s permanent secretary, Jeremy Pocklington, said he was satisfied the requirements of “propriety and regularity” had been met, the committee said it was “disappointed” that a summary of his assessment remained unpublished. “This lack of transparency has fuelled accusations of political bias in the selection process, and has risked the civil service’s reputation for integrity and impartiality,” it said. The MHCLG responded to the report with a statement rejecting the main conclusions. A spokesperson said: “We completely disagree with the committee’s criticism of the town fund selection process, which was comprehensive, robust and fair. “The towns fund will help level up the country, creating jobs and building stronger and more resilient local economies.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1954,Italy passes 1m Covid cases as calls grow for national lockdown,11/11/20,"Italy surpassed 1m confirmed coronavirus infections on Wednesday, as its death toll climbed rapidly in a second wave that is wreaking havoc on hospitals. The government is biding its time on resorting to another national lockdown despite repeated calls from overwhelmed medics for such a policy. A further 623 Covid-related deaths were registered on Wednesday, the highest daily tally since early April, and there were 32,961 new infections. Italy is the third country in mainland Europe, after Spain and France, to exceed 1m cases. Italy was the first country in Europe to be hit by the pandemic and has the highest death toll on the continent, at 42,953. Doctors said this week there would be an additional 10,000 deaths in a month unless drastic action was taken. There are now 29,444 people hospitalised for Covid-19 across the country – the highest number since the start of the pandemic. “We need a general lockdown like the one in March and April, maybe for two or three weeks or a month, in order to bring the infection rate down,” said Giovanni Leoni, the vice-president of an Italian doctors’ federation. “The number of admissions to intensive care is doubling every 10 days and at this speed it will be very difficult to guarantee care to patients with other diseases.” The critical threshold of Covid patients taking up 30% of intensive care has already been exceeded in some regions, and hospitals are struggling to find space for people in general wards. Ambulances have been queueing outside emergency units in the badly hit northern city of Turin, where emergency teams are also treating Covid patients in their homes. An otherwise healthy 21-year-old woman died of Covid in one of the city’s hospitals this week. In the southern city of Naples, people have been treated for Covid in their cars as they wait outside hospitals. One of the reasons for the chaos is that people are rushing to emergency units even with mild symptoms. The further south, where hospitals are less equipped than those in the wealthier north, the more worrying the situation. Leoluca Orlando, the mayor of Palermo, said his city and the rest of Sicily risked heading towards “an announced massacre”. Last week Sicily was placed in the medium-risk “orange zone” as part of the government’s tiered system, which imposes varying levels of restrictions on regions according to factors including the Covid transmission rate, hospital efficiency and availability of intensive care beds. The number of these beds across Italy has increased from 5,000 at the beginning of the pandemic to 7,500, but there is a shortage of anaesthetists. There are 3,081 Covid patients in intensive care nationwide, and the average time spent there is two to three weeks. “It is a very complicated situation,” said Tuttlio Prestileo, a doctor of infectious diseases at the Benfratelli hospital in Palermo. “On Tuesday we met with the regional government to increase intensive care spaces. We are making a superhuman effort. But we cannot guarantee space indefinitely.” In the last month 18,000 health workers have become infected with Covid while doing their jobs, exacerbating the shortages. Silvio Scotti, the president of the Italian federation of general practitioners, has also called for a national lockdown and described the government’s three-tiered system of red, orange and yellow as “a joke of a jigsaw”. “We have doctors, nurses, health workers, cleaners, people who have been fighting this battle for months now,” he told Sky TG24. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, told La Stampa on Wednesday that he was waiting to see whether recent measures have an impact on the infection curve over the next few days. “It’s true, there are critical issues,” he said. “But a generalised lockdown shouldn’t be the first choice – the costs would be too high.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1955,Japan warns of third wave amid rising Covid infections,11/11/20,"Officials in Japan have warned of an impending third wave of coronavirus infections amid a rise in cases blamed on colder weather and a government campaign to encourage domestic tourism. As the prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, vowed to secure enough vaccines to cover Japan’s entire population, the number of daily cases continued to rise after several weeks of staying relatively stable. Japan reported 1,284 new Covid-19 infections on Tuesday, bringing its total to 111,222 according to a Kyodo news agency tally based on official data. The death toll stood at 1,864. While Japan has avoided the large number of cases and deaths seen in the UK, US and other countries – with widespread mask wearing often cited as a factor – the decision to press ahead with a heavily subsidised tourism campaign in July appears to have contributed to a new wave of infections.
Cases are not only rising in Tokyo – the epicentre of Japan’s outbreak with more than 33,000 cases – but also in prefectures with large urban populations such as Osaka, Kanagawa and Aichi, whose governor, Hideaki Omura, said last week: “Effectively the third wave has arrived.”
Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost main island, succeeded in containing a large outbreak after declaring a state of emergency in February, but this week saw daily cases rise above 200 for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Most of the island’s cases have been traced to Sapporo, its biggest city and home to a large nightlife economy. Total infections in Hokkaido have reached 4,364 with health experts blaming cold weather for driving more people into poorly ventilated buildings and a rise in tourist numbers. In response, hostess and host bars and clubs have been asked to close between 10pm and 5am and restaurants to stop serving alcohol after 10pm. “I don’t think Hokkaido is the only place that needs countermeasures to cope with lower temperatures and changes in the environment,” Kyodo quoted Hokkaido’s governor, Naomichi Suzuki, as saying. Japan’s response since the beginning of the pandemic has emphasised mask-wearing and the need to avoid the “three Cs”: closed spaces, crowded places and close-contact settings – precautions that are harder to take in cold weather. A government panel of experts has called for new measures to see Japan through the winter, warning that inaction could see a rapid rise in cases. Speaking last week after the number of nationwide cases topped 1,000 for the first time in more than two months, Suga told senior party figures: “We need to deal with the situation with maximum vigilance.” The chief cabinet secretary, Katsunobu Kato, raised the possibility that Hokkaido could be removed from Go To Travel, a ¥1.7tn (US$16bn) campaign that provides generous food, travel and accommodation subsidies for domestic tourists in an attempt to boost the world’s third-biggest economy. But he was later contradicted by Suga, who said: “We’re monitoring the situation and we will carry out the campaign, taking into account the views of experts. Currently there are no plans to exclude Hokkaido from the programme.” The campaign was launched in the early summer – initially without Tokyo’s involvement – despite warnings that a significant increase in domestic travel could spread the virus to parts of the country that had been relatively unaffected. Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University hospital, speculated that the recent rise in infections was “a combination of the Go To campaign, complacency among people and politicians, with the additional potential factor of lower temperatures”. “We need to be determined in lowering the infection rate,” Iwata told the Guardian, adding that he expected a rise in serious cases to “come later”. “Sporadic measures will only prolong the problem. Decreasing opportunities to get infected is the simplest way to lower the number of cases, so politicians need to offer direct [financial] support to people who need it, not a travel campaign that is helping to spread the disease.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1956,Lee Cain: Johnson loyalist who turned down chief of staff role,11/11/20,"Lee Cain was the loyal Boris Johnson adviser who chose to resign just as it looked like he might become the prime minister’s chief of staff. While his friend and ally Dominic Cummings dominates Whitehall, the 39-year-old Downing Street director of communications had remained resolutely low key, preferring to brief journalists rather than be written about. Cain’s loyalty to Johnson was considered stronger than Cummings, making his sudden departure all the more surprising. “While others in No 10 have their own opinions or agendas and are frankly not thinking of the PM, Cain works hard to channel what Johnson wanted,” said a former special adviser who departed after last December’s election.
Insiders added that Cain’s role had been strategic for some time. A key period, it is said, was in April, when Johnson was hospitalised with coronavirus and Cummings was also off sick. Cain had to cover for Cummings and was “running the show in many ways”, the former aide said. But his closeness to the abrasive Cummings created problems as the government struggled with the pandemic crisis. There was speculation of tension with Carrie Symonds, another former special adviser, now engaged to the prime minister. But when asked, Cain would confidently dismiss the issue, saying “me and the boss are tight”. Johnson values loyalty and Cain has displayed it, although, unlike many Tory apparatchiks, he arrived on the scene relatively late. Cain went to Ormskirk grammar school in Lancashire and Staffordshire University, before starting a career in journalism working first for local papers, including the Gloucester Citizen, before moving briefly to the Sun and then the Labour-supporting Mirror. He spent time as the Mirror Chicken during the 2010 election campaign, taunting Conservative leader David Cameron in feathered fancy dress. “Malcolm Clucker,” the paper read when it broke the story last year. The spinner saw the funny side of the improbable episode; a framed copy of the front page is in his Downing Street office. Cain’s journalism career had stalled and he was working as a legal PR when he applied to join Vote Leave as head of broadcast in early 2016. His political career took off. After the surprise Brexit vote, Cain was rewarded with a special adviser’s job and went to work for Johnson at the Foreign Office, where the two became close.
When Johnson resigned and joined the backbenches over Brexit, Cain stayed on as his adviser. He even worked without pay for a while, telling reporters he believed “the boss would come good”. As Theresa May’s grip on power weakened, Cain worked reporters on the left and right in Westminster’s tearoom and at nearby bars, often briefing against the then prime minister. Yet the clubbable nature comes with a pugnacious streak. Frustrations with the media coverage at the beginning of Johnson’s premiership led to Cain banning ministers from Radio 4’s Today programme, Channel 4 News and other outlets. Critics described the approach as Trumpian but Cain was happy to pick the fight, arguing that Today had a pro-remain bias, as demonstrated by recording programmes from university campuses. “The ban will stop when they better understand the country,” he said. It was ultimately Covid-19 that forced Cain to make peace with the BBC, although there are ongoing feuds with others such as Piers Morgan at ITV’s Good Morning Britain. Friends said the relentless, combative nature of the job led Cain to contemplate leaving Downing Street “once the government had got over the hump of Covid”. About a week ago, Johnson asked him to become chief of staff, presenting the loyalist with an unexpected dilemma. Few, though, expected him to quit: that he did so suggested the change on offer struck him as less of a promotion than it might have first appeared.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1957,Mother demands access for families to loved ones in care facilities,11/11/20,"A mother whose disabled son died following a “vortex” of decline when visits to his care facility were stopped has demanded greater access for other families to prevent similar deaths during the pandemic. Melanie Macfarlane, whose son Jamie died on 30 October, said she believed he would probably be alive if she had been allowed face-to-face visits during the spring lockdown when his mental and physical health began to rapidly deteriorate. The 21-year-old had Sanfilippo syndrome, a rare disorder that causes learning disabilities and a deterioration of physical and mental skills. He had a shortened life expectancy, but being prevented from seeing his loved ones triggered a catastrophic premature decline, Macfarlane said. He had an attachment disorder that focused on his mother, who did not see him for more than three months while he was in lockdown at St Elizabeth’s, a residential learning centre in Hertfordshire.
“The carers were made blind to him by the use of masks,” Macfarlane said. “For someone who can’t process that it must have been terrifying, and that his mummy couldn’t come and rescue him.” Macfarlane spoke out as MPs called for greater visiting rights in a parliamentary debate, which heard constituents’ accounts of desolation at being separated from loved ones. Huw Merriman, the Conservative MP for Bexhill and Battle, warned: “In seeking to protect vulnerable residents we may not only diminish their quality of life, we may end up prematurely ending it altogether.” Jamie Macfarlane’s death was raised by Joy Morrissey MP, who told parliament Jamie would “call out in anguish: ‘I want my mum, I want my mum’.” “I cannot begin to imagine what it must have felt like knowing that her son was denied the care of his family for months, denied a hug, denied the comfort of a warm hand holding his, denied dignity in his suffering,” the Conservative MP for Beaconsfield said. Denying access to loved ones was “inhumane and cruel”, she said. The care minister, Helen Whately, said she was looking into the circumstances of Jamie Macfarlane’s death, but said loosening visiting restrictions now was “strongly against the clinical advice I have received”. However, she said some family members would be able to visit residents if they tested negative first, with a trial starting on Monday in 30 care homes. She said there could be a further roll-out of family testing in December. The shadow care minister, Liz Kendall, said: “After eight months of lockdown there isn’t time to wait for a pilot scheme or another set of guidelines. We need action now.” Macfarlane described how, during lockdown, she found her son was bewildered by seeing her on a screen rather than in real life, and when visits restarted in June he was changed. “He completely went into himself and became very unhappy,” she said. “That’s what upset me most about the lockdown: the misery he went through because of it. All his joie de vivre, the lightness in his face, his joy of life went.” There were family visits in July and August, but his decline continued. Anxiety and depression medication had to be increased. “He turned from a young man who sometimes slept for 15 hours to not sleeping at all,” she said. “He was exhausted and miserable. He got very thin. He was so emaciated.” In September he was admitted to Wexham Park hospital in Slough for a month to try to boost his nutrition, and doctors inserted a feeding tube into his stomach. He couldn’t stand it and ripped it out, which caused serious damage. He developed sepsis and was admitted to intensive care. His body, frail from the weight loss over the previous months, and his underlying health conditions meant he did not have the capacity to fight back. He was admitted to a hospice on 28 October and died two days later.
“The absence of visiting created a perfect storm and the outcome was inevitable,” said Macfarlane. “Once his mood was depressed it was like he was in some vortex that would only end one way. The speed with which we lost him and the rapidity of his decline wasn’t caused by his condition. I wasn’t expecting to lose him this year. “What’s important is this stops happening and people who lack capacity are given back their dignity. Everyone is manically nervous about death because of Covid so it is easy to see why it happened. But human beings are more than a bundle of physical needs. Emotional and psychological health in cases like this have not been prioritised.” Jill Rankin, the interim chief executive of St Elizabeth’s, said: “We absolutely understand how difficult it was for Jamie and his loved ones to be apart during the period in which government guidance prevented visits. Limiting the number of visits is not something we ever want to do, and we have sought to mitigate the impact of this through video calls, regular updates to loved ones … However, reducing the number of visitors to the centre is one of our most effective tools in the battle against coronavirus, and it continues to be a difficult balancing act to have as many safe visits as possible within the guidance at a time when cases in the community continue to rise.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1958,New species of extinct monk seal identified from fossils in New Zealand,11/11/20,"Fossils found in New Zealand have led to the discovery of a previously unidentified species of extinct monk seal, which biologists say is the biggest breakthrough in seal evolution in seven decades. The animal – named Eomonachus belegaerensis – was named after a sea in JRR Tolkien’s the Lord of the Rings, and has radically changed scientists’ understanding of how seal species have evolved around the world. Eomonachus belegaerensis lived in the waters around New Zealand some three million years ago, and was 2.5 metres in length and weighed around 200-250kg.
Monash University palaeontologist James Rule, a PhD candidate in the Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, worked with a team of Trans Tasman scientists on his paper. “This new species of extinct monk seal is the first of its kind from the Southern Hemisphere. Its discovery really turns seal evolution on its head,” Rule said.
“Until now, we thought that all true seals originated in the northern hemisphere, and then crossed the equator just once or twice during their entire evolutionary history. Instead, many of them appear to have evolved in the southern Pacific, and then criss-crossed the equator up to eight times.” The equator usually acts as a barrier for marine animals crossing, Rule said, as the waters are so warm, so the discovery that seals crossed numerous times over their evolutionary history is significant. It was previously thought that all true seals originated in the north Atlantic, with some later crossing the equator to live as far south as Antarctica.
Eomonachus shows that many ancient seals, including the ancestors of today’s monk, elephant and Antarctic seals, actually evolved in the southern hemisphere. Dr Felix Marx, Te Papa Museum of New Zealand’s curator of marine mammals, said the discovery was a triumph for citizen science, as the fossils studied by the Monash team were collected by beach-goers in Taranaki between the years 2009-2016. “This new species has been discovered thanks to numerous, exceptionally well-preserved fossils – all of which were found by members of the public,” Marx said. “New Zealand is incredibly rich in fossils, and so far we have barely scratched the surface.” Rule says now ancient monk seals have been discovered in New Zealand, it makes the research possibilities for all of the south Pacific much more urgent. Traditionally the southern hemisphere is under-researched compared to the northern hemisphere, Rule said. “I would like to see if there’s any monk seals to be found in Australia. Also, now that New Zealand has produced a monk seals I want to look for other seals [in NZ] that would be completely unexpected.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1959,"NHS Covid drive aims to vaccinate up to 5,000 people daily at each mass centre",11/11/20,"Thousands of hospital staff will join the drive to vaccinate all adults in England against coronavirus and will be deployed at mass vaccination centres, each of them aiming to give the jab to up to 5,000 people a day, NHS officials involved in the plans said. The NHS intends to use football stadiums, town halls and conference buildings in England to inoculate at least 2,000 people per centre each day. In urban areas, there will be a network of these centres.
The new facilities will be additional to the 1,560 community-based vaccination centres run by GPs, which will each dispense 200 to 500 jabs a day. Other forms of vaccination are also planned, including mobile vans and visits to homes and prisons. All the venues will do temperature checks on people before entry allowing space for social distancing and a 15-minute recovery time. Neither NHS England nor the government has so far published an overall projection for how many vaccinations all these venues and methods of delivery will carry out daily in total. NHS England is expected to publish its “deployment plan”, outlining the rollout, next week. However, seconding personnel from already under-staffed hospitals to aid the vaccine rollout could lead to patients having to wait longer for care. The NHS is already facing a massive backlog of cases due to its decision to suspend most non-Covid care provision in the spring. NHS England has asked health service heads across England to be ready to vaccinate many numbers of people at large sites not in use because of the pandemic. The details emerged as government figures showed the UK’s Covid-19 death toll has surpassed 50,000, adding to the pressure to roll out a comprehensive vaccination programme as soon as possible. The centres are also expected to play a key role in immunising the general public in a second phase of the vaccination programme, following the dispensing of two doses each to the estimated 22 million, including carehome residents, NHS staff and those aged 50 or over, considered a priority.
A Whitehall official explained the centres’ key role, saying: “We are looking to vaccinate as many people as is humanly possible as quickly as possible. We want to get the country back to normal as soon as possible, which would allow us to open up the economy.” Staff from every hospital will be seconded to the vaccination campaign, which ministers see as vital to achieving their aim of reviving the economy and normalising life. The staff, however, could be absent from their normal duties for several months, which could affect hospital services. But many NHS workers are thought to be keen to play their part in combating the virus. Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, said on Wednesday that he would happily give up his free time to help administer the vaccine. “This is one of the most important, if not the most important, vaccination programme we’ve done for decades,” he said. “If I can help with this in some evenings and weekends, doing some extra vaccinations sessions myself, then I’m going to.” District nurses, health visitors and other health professionals who do not work in hospitals will also be drafted in to help, amid concerns that, while GPs are playing the lead role in the immunisation effort, there are too few of them to deliver the NHS target of vaccinating a million people a week.
Vaccinators, who will include podiatrists and physiotherapists, will also tour areas in vans or buses and visit staff “pop-up” immunisation clinics to administer jabs. They will also offer the vaccine to people gathered for religious services. NHS England, which is running the immunisation drive, is finalising the details of the logistics to distribute whichever vaccines are available and intends to publish its plans next week.
Although reports have said the rollout will begin on 1 December, Whitehall and NHS sources said that that was premature and it was “very unlikely” that supplies of the Pfizer vaccine, or the one being developed by Oxford University and Astra Zeneca, would be available until early 2021. Ruth Rankine, director of the primary care network at the NHS Confederation, said that while family doctors and their staff would play the lead role in vaccination, especially in the first phase, other healthcare professionals would contribute to NHS England’s “all hands to the pump” approach, with ultimately tens of thousands of staff involved.
The plans became public after it emerged that the UK government had spent £50m to reserve manufacturing capacity at a plant in Wales to guarantee supply of a second Covid-19 vaccine candidate being developed by Oxford University and Astra Zeneca. The government has also secured a £50m manufacturing facility in a pharmaceutical company in north Wales for millions of doses of the Oxford vaccine and other candidates currently in the trial phase. According to a notification to the EU, the contract with CP Pharmaceuticals, in Wrexham, involves an 18-month facility “to provide for vaccine in bulk product form to be converted into individual doses capable of rollout via a mass vaccination programme”. CP Pharmaceuticals, trading as Wockhardt, is already a big supplier of generic drugs to the NHS and has been doing trial runs for the Oxford/Astra Zeneca AZD122 candidate vaccine in anticipation of that vaccine gaining regulatory approval. A spokesman said however the facility could be involved in multiple vaccine production if the government so required. Ravi Limaye, managing director of Wockhardt, UK, said: “We have a sophisticated sterile manufacturing facility and a highly skilled workforce. We expect to start delivering the first doses of the vaccine later this year.” The government has also asked specialist healthcare warehousing owners to tender for distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine. Those contacted have been obliged to sign non-disclosure agreements but it is thought that that relates to getting supply channels opened up for the Pfizer vaccine in the existing national network of 50 or so hubs, which supply the NHS and pharmacies twice a day. Martin Sawer, executive director of the Healthcare Distribution Association, said the association’s members were working closely with government “to understand how the existing robust and efficient pharmaceutical distribution network can be utilised to assist with the rapid rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine once it receives regulatory approval”. Pfizer will manufacture the drug at its plant in Puurs, Belgium, with a secure cold-supply chain enabling delivery to 1,500 vaccination centres in England. The logistics entail specially designed hi-tech fridge boxes or “shippers” to hold 1,000 vials each at temperatures of -75°c ±15°c for up to 10 days. Each of the shippers will be loaded with heat sensors that will transmit temperature readings to a Pfizer control centre to ensure the efficacy of the drug is not compromised while it is being transported. After arriving in the UK the vials are to be distributed to vaccination clinics where they can be stored at temperatures of 2-8°C for up to five days. Pfizer said it was confident the supply chain would not be disrupted by Brexit border checkpoints since the company had secured priority routes under contingency plans put in place for a UK “no deal” Brexit. “We have a robust plan in place regarding supply of the investigational Pfizer and BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine candidate should it receive approval in the UK, in the event of a no-deal scenario. We are confident of our capability to deliver doses to the government’s designated facilities, according to product requirements.” Last month the government signed ferry contracts worth £87m to secure freight capacity for medical supplies on nine routes serving the English ports of Felixstowe, Harwich, Hull, Newhaven, Poole, Portsmouth, Teesport, and Tilbury, which were described as being “in areas less likely to experience disruption”. • This article was amended on 12 November 2020 to make clear that inoculation of “up to 5,000 people a day” is an aim for each mass-vaccination centre, rather than a national figure.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1960,PMQs truce proves brief as Starmer goes on PR offensive | John Crace,11/11/20,"For a moment it seemed that peace might have broken out between the two party leaders at prime minister’s questions. That after months of slugging it out over the government’s handling of the coronavirus, there was to be a brief period of detente as both parties allowed themselves to enjoy the possibility of an end to the nightmare. True, Boris Johnson hadn’t been able to bring himself to congratulate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, but he and Keir Starmer had been able to agree the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine trials represented real hope and that war veterans’ charities did great work and needed all the help they could get. That’s about as long as the truce lasted, because the Labour leader then went on the attack. How come Help for Heroes got just £6m from the Treasury when the government had handed out £670k in PR contracts to the vaccine taskforce and £130m to other PR companies over the past year? Boris blustered and feigned surprise that anyone should question his government’s integrity. Obviously it made sense to award contracts initially to friends of friends as it saved all the hassle of having to put them out to public tender. Much like appointing Tory MPs’ wives Kate Bingham and Typhoid Dido to key roles had speeded up the recruitment process for Covid jobs. Why bother to interview someone you’ve already spoken to over dinner? Besides, Johnson continued, the £670k had proved to be money well spent because if it hadn’t been for PR consultants like the ones we had in the UK, then the drug companies would never have got anyone to participate in their trials. It didn’t appear to have occurred to him that this was a job most interns could have done in under a day. Just a quick, no frills 30-second government information film recorded on a mobile phone and broadcast on all channels at prime time (almost certainly at no cost) asking for volunteers to take part in vaccine trials would probably have hoovered up at least 100,000 willing applicants. Hell, I got a request via one of my Covid apps and signed up on the spot. But let’s for a minute consider the possibility that no one would have thought of a public service information film. In which case, a few billboards with some choice slogans should have done the trick. “Would you like the chance to help save a member of your family from Covid-19?” might have hit the spot. Or if that wasn’t hard-hitting enough, then just play a bit dirty with: “How many of your friends and family are you prepared to watch get ill or die before Christmas next year?” That should get people calling in. See, that wasn’t so hard. And because I’m feeling in a giving mood, I’ll let the government have that for mates’ rates of just £150k. Just send it to the usual offshore account. Starmer wasn’t prepared to let Johnson get away with that kind of waffle and started talking about knowing the value of the pound in your pocket. Shades of Harold Wilson there. Keir then went on to ask just how many usable face masks the private contractor Ayanda had delivered to the NHS for £150m (the answer: none) and whether an extra £374m handed out to Randox, the company that recalled 750,000 of its unused testing kits earlier this summer, was money well spent? At which point Boris went off on a long ramble about boxing gloves that didn’t land a knockout blow – most of us were under the impression that the whole point of the vaccine was that it would deliver a knockout blow and life could return near enough to normal – and to accuse Starmer of just being against private business as a matter of principle. Now it was the Labour leader’s turn to look bemused. Nobody had anything against private business. He just wanted to know that what he was getting actually worked and offered value for money. By now Starmer appeared bored by Johnson – a feeling shared by many in the chamber: the man who was supposed to be the great communicator who could reach out to the public has turned out to have the repertoire of an emotionally stunted Bullingdon Club boy – and used his last three questions to address the chancellor, the man he regards as the prime minister-in-waiting. “I know he’s not here,” Keir reminded everyone, “so I suppose you are the next best thing.” That putdown stung Boris – a narcissistic wound too far – and he never really recovered. He had no answer to the Labour leader’s accusations that lives, jobs and money could have been saved if thegovernment had followed both his and Sage’s advice and acted more decisively. There was just time for Labour’s Angela Eagle to ask Johnson if he had any words for Donald Trump and to give him a second chance to congratulate Biden. This time Boris didn’t sidestep the issue. He referred to Trump dismissively as “the previous president” – loyalty and Boris are not close bedfellows and he can spot any lame duck other than himself – and after a few token words about getting on with any president, he went on to say how much he had enjoyed talking to Biden about Cop26. Curiously, Brexit seems to have been not mentioned in the conversation. And that was that. It hadn’t been a vintage PMQs but they seldom are these days. Boris knows he’s going to come out of the half-hour session looking a little shabbier than before and his only goal is to muddy the waters and keep the damage to a bare minimum. And he’d just about managed it. His expectations of himself are now as low as those of his own backbenchers, who have come to dread his public performances. It’s one thing for Johnson to embarrass himself; they had learned to live with that. It was quite another to embarrass the entire government. • This article was amended on 12 November. An earlier version said that Keir Starmer asked Boris Johnson “how many face masks [Ayanda] had delivered for £150m”; this has been amended to make clear that he asked how many “usable” masks had been delivered to the NHS under the contract. Around 50 million masks supplied by Ayanda were later deemed unsuitable for NHS workers because they had been purchased by the DHSC with ear-loops, rather than head-loops.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1961,"Seventh straight day of 100,000 new US Covid cases as hospitalizations hit a high point",11/11/20,"The US hit a record number of coronavirus hospitalizations on Tuesday and surpassed 1 million new confirmed cases in just the first 10 days of November, as a nationwide surge of infections that shows no signs of slowing. The country recorded a seventh consecutive day of more than 100,000 new cases, and one of the public health advisers recruited to president-elect Joe Biden’s transition team warned that those case numbers could double in the coming weeks under the leadership of Donald Trump.
Monday saw the US surpass 10m total cases – the highest number in the world, by far – and reach a death toll of 238,256. There were 111,433 new cases on Monday and 590 new deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Hospitalisations have risen to nearly 62,000 nationwide, according to the Covid Tracking Project, which saw the biggest single-day increase since 10 July. It found South Dakota had the highest hospitalisation rates in the US and said Illinois had reported more than 10,000 cases for four days straight. In California, cases are at their highest levels in months. On Tuesday, the state announced several counties would revert back to more restrictive reopening rules as a result.
Biden has already warned the US is “facing a very dark winter” and that even with Pfizer’s announcement that it has a vaccine it believes is 90% effective, 200,000 more lives could be lost in the US in the next few months. Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services, said on Tuesday the federal government will have enough of the vaccine by the end of December “to have vaccinated our most vulnerable citizens”. By the end of January, he told NBC, there will be enough for all healthcare workers and first responders, with March or early April targeted for a general vaccination programme. Experts say cases could rise exponentially in the coming weeks. Michael Osterholm, director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and a member of Biden’s Covid-19 advisory board, told CNN daily cases could soon double. “We are watching cases increase substantially in this country far beyond, I think, what most people ever thought could happen,” he said, adding: “It will not surprise me if in the next weeks we see over 200,000 new cases a day.” On Tuesday, Donald Trump tweeted purported quotes from a Fox Business journalist and his former White House doctor turned congressman-elect, Ronny Jackson, crediting the president with the possible arrival of a vaccine. He also retweeted a post describing Biden as an “ambulance chaser”. Pfizer senior vice-president Kathrin Jansen told the New York Times the company did not participate in the government’s Operation Warp Speed or take any of its money. The Food and Drug Administration said it had issued an emergency use authorisation for Eli Lilly’s monoclonal antibody therapy, called bamlanivimab, to treat mild to moderate cases in adults and children over 12. On Tuesday, Osterholm told CBS a “perfect storm” was forming and that hospitals were “about to be overrun”. “We’re going to see by far the darkest days of this pandemic between now and next spring when the vaccine becomes available,” he told CBS. Top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci told MSNBC he expects the FDA will probably put in for an emergency use authorisation of the Pfizer vaccine in the next week to week and a half. Providing it goes through, he said, doses should be available for highest-priority people in December. Asked if he would take the vaccine if it was approved by the FDA, he said he would. “I’m going to look at the data, but I trust Pfizer. I trust the FDA,” Fauci said. “These are colleagues of mine for decades, the career scientists. If they look at this data, and they say this data is solid, let’s go ahead and approve it, I promise you, I will take the vaccine, and I will recommend that my family take the vaccine.” He also reiterated the importance of wearing a mask, saying: “You protect others. Their mask protects you, and your mask also protects you.”
Public health officials believe the federal government has not done enough to encourage Americans to take a vaccine or prepare them for what to expect. “This needed to happen ‘yesterday’,” Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told USA Today. “It’s like watching a train wreck happen.” Across the US, states are struggling. In El Paso, Texas, officials have six mobile morgues and have requested four more, CNN reported. The state was approaching 1m infections. In Ohio the chief medical officer, Dr Bruce Vanderhoff, warned of an “unprecedented spike” in hospital use and a growing demand on staff. “If we don’t control the spread of this virus, we won’t be able to care for those who are acutely ill without postponing important, but less urgent, care,” he said. “We anticipate that this kind of shift could happen in a matter of weeks if trends don’t change.” In Utah, the governor Gary Herbert, warned of a “dire situation” in hospitals, declared a state of emergency, issued a mask mandate and restricted social gatherings. “This is a sacrifice for all of us,” he said. “But as we slow the spread it will make all the difference for our overworked healthcare workers, who desperately need our help.” Meanwhile, 28 employees of the election board in one of Missouri’s largest counties, Jackson, have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director, Tammy Brown, a Republican, believes they got infected from voters.

1962,"UK death toll from Covid-19 passes 50,000",11/11/20,"The UK’s Covid-19 death toll has surpassed 50,000, government figures have revealed, as the nation struggles to deal with a deadly second wave. The news served as a sobering reminder of the severity of the crisis after hopes were raised on Monday that an end may be in sight with announcement that a vaccine had been shown to be effective. The alarming milestone was passed on Wednesday as Whitehall said a further 595 people had died within 28 days of testing positive, bringing the total by this measure to 50,365.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles separate figures which suggest the death toll from Covid-19 is substantially higher – closer to 65,000. “This is a point that should never have been reached,” said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the British Medical Association (BMA). “Today’s figure is a terrible indictment of poor preparation, poor organisation by the government, insufficient infection control measures, coupled with late and often confusing messaging for the public.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said: “It is a grim milestone and we’re the first in Europe to hit it. Behind these numbers is a devastated family, one for every death, and they have to be uppermost in our mind.” He accused the government of being “slow at phase one” and of failing to learn lessons thereafter. “We owe it to all of the families who are grieving to get on top of the virus and head towards a vaccine and that’s what the government must absolutely focus on now.”
Boris Johnson reacted to the news during a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in south-east London, telling reporters: “Every death is a tragedy. We mourn everybody who is gone.”
Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director of Public Health England, said: “Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures – and the sacrifices we are all making – is seen and is reflected in the data. By limiting contact with others, you are helping to stop the spread of the virus. This will lead to fewer infections and help to save lives. Together we can bring the virus under control.” Alongside the news of progress towards the rollout of a vaccine, Johnson also lauded last week’s launch of a mass-testing programme in Liverpool, insisting the country had the tools to finally end the pandemic. “We have two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and month that follow but I have got to stress that we are not out of the woods yet. It does require everybody to follow the guidance,” he said. But the BMA heavily criticised his handling of the pandemic, saying the nation’s health service had “started on the back foot, with years of underfunding seriously affecting its ability to keep it running effectively”. Both Johnson and Starmer encouraged people to get vaccinated as soon as it was possible. And Joe Anderson, Liverpool’s mayor, said more than 44,000 people have taken part in the city’s testing pilot. The government said that, as of 9am on Wednesday, there had been a further 22,950 lab-confirmed cases in the UK. That brought the total number of cases in the UK to 1,256,725. This daily death total is the worst since early May and is substantially greater than Tuesday’s 532, which was the previous highest total during the second wave. The UK’s headline death toll of 50,365 only counts people who have died within 28 days of testing positive. The ONS, however, compiles separate figures based on mentions of Covid-19 on death certificates, which is considered by experts to be a more reliable estimate. The Northern Irish and Scottish agencies use the same methodology. The death toll as counted by the three statistical agencies covering the four UK nations currently stands at 63,317 deaths. But the government’s dashboard shows that a further 2,511 people have died since the latest statistical releases, bringing the total number of Covid-related deaths to 65,828.
The government changed its own methodology midway through the pandemic after it claimed its figures could be overstating the true death toll, which was revised down by 5,000.
The UK is the first country in Europe to suffer 50,000 deaths. As of Wednesday morning, Italy – the second-worst hit country in Europe – was on 42,330 deaths, with France having reported 40,987 deaths, according to international data from Johns Hopkins University. More than 1,000 deaths have been recorded in England in one week, according to the latest ONS figures. For the week ending 30 October, there were 1,258 deaths involving Covid-19. The number of deaths involving coronavirus has increased in all of the English regions, with the north-west having the largest number, at 445 deaths. The number of deaths occurring in the week ending 30 October in the north-west of England was 31.4% higher this week compared with the five-year average for the region. London was the only English region to have fewer overall deaths than the five-year average. Scottish figures released on Wednesday saw its death toll increase to 4,856 deaths reaching a six-week high of 206 in the week to 8 November.",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1963,"UK government must condemn Trump denial of defeat, says Labour",11/11/20,"The government should condemn Donald Trump’s refusal to concede defeat in the US election, a stance that poses a danger to democratic values around the world, Keir Starmer’s spokesman said. No 10 has so far refused to criticise the actions of the US president, who has refused to acknowledge the victory of his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, and has continued to make baseless claims of voter fraud. “Donald Trump’s actions are wrong and the British government should say so,” a spokesman for the Labour leader said. “Any attempts to undermine democratic process should not be left unchallenged. We call out that in other countries across the world. And we should be able to do so with our friends and allies in America. The actions are deeply concerning.”
Starmer’s spokesman said the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had “seemed a bit concerned” about criticising the president’s actions. Johnson and Raab have been repeatedly pressed on whether they believe the president is acting unreasonably. During prime minister’s questions on Wednesday the Labour MP Angela Eagle said Trump’s “continuing refusal to accept the result is both embarrassing for him and dangerous for American democracy”. Johnson said: “I have had a good relationship with the previous president, I do not resile from that. It is the duty of all British prime ministers to have a good relationship with the White House. But I am delighted to find the many areas in which the incoming Biden-Harris administration is able to make common cause with us.” Speaking on Sunday, Raab said: “We really don’t want to get drawn into the cut and thrust, the controversies, the claims, the counter-claims, either in the election or in the immediate aftermath. We respect Americans’ rights to choose for themselves and we respect the checks and balances in the American system which will produce, as they have, a clear result.” The shadow trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, told ITV’s Peston programme last week that the refusal to criticise Trump was hypocrisy. “If he had been the leader of any other country in the world then the foreign secretary and the prime minister would have called it out. [Trump] is behaving like a tinpot dictator … and it’s not acceptable and it should be called out.”",,Politics,Guardian,5
1964,"US Covid response must tie economic recovery to virus control, experts say",11/11/20,"Politicians and officials leading the US response to the Covid-19 pandemic must present economic recovery and virus control as inextricably linked, after exit polls showed a divided nation views the issues as separate, public health researchers and economists say.
An overwhelming majority of voters who cast their ballot in favor of president-elect Joe Biden listed the Covid-19 pandemic as their top issue, while Trump voters were far more likely to be concerned about the economy, exit polls found. “It is possible to stop Covid-19 and to rescue us from social and economic ruin, we just have to have the will to do it,” said Gregg Gonsalves, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Medicine, whose work focuses on improving responses to epidemic diseases. Throughout the pandemic, he said, “economists were saying the same thing as public health – that you have to stop the virus.” The calls for renewed public outreach come as more than 237,000 Americans have died of the virus, more than 10 million have been infected, and the coming weeks are likely to bring the worst outbreaks of the entire pandemic. Public health officials said they must emphasize both that Americans should wear masks, social distance, avoid high-risk situations, and that no one in public health wants another economic lockdown. Dually, they said, the emphasis must be that the economy will not recover if the virus continues to spread uncontrolled. “The economy is really, really important to public health officials,” said Dr Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “Everybody in public health is concerned about the economic devastation as a result of having a pandemic,” he added. “But it’s the pandemic that’s causing that, not the response to the pandemic.”
Economists are also concerned about a divided electorate that viewed the public health and economic issues as separate. Williams Spriggs, an economics professor at Howard University and chief economist for the AFL-CIO, said his field failed to recognize the task ahead of them when the pandemic hit. “What we can see from the data – it’s the disease that has slowed down economic activity,” said Spriggs. “Whether they’re told to stay at home or not, [the virus] has made people uncomfortable gathering in public spaces, getting on airplanes, staying in hotels.” Exit polls are often messy, and even in normal years provide only a rough sketch of how different demographic groups vote. Experts believe 2020 may paint an even less reliable picture, because so many people cast their vote through mail-in ballots. Further, Trump broadly outperformed pollsters’ expectations, raising broader questions about the reliability of the polls. Nevertheless, if current figures hold after the research has been validated, there is a stark divide in the US on how to combat the pandemic effectively. Thirty-five per cent of voters ranked the economy as their top concern, more than double the number who ranked the pandemic as the most important issue facing the country. Further, people who saw the economy as the top issue also overwhelmingly split for Trump, 82% versus 17% for Biden, according to exit polls conducted by the New York Times. Those who ranked the pandemic as their top issue overwhelmingly split for Biden, at 82% versus 14%. Biden voters were also more likely to have actually experienced the economic and health impacts of the pandemic, where Trump voters were more likely to earn more than $100,000 a year and rank their family’s economic situation as “better today”. “Particularly early on, when we shut things down, that’s a very bold action on the economy and I think that really struck people,” Plescia said. “But maybe they lost sight of the fact there’s a reason we’re doing this.” Some of the nation’s leading public health experts have been critical of their own ability to deliver complex messages to the public following a calamitous lockdown last spring. “I don’t think all of us in the public health community have done a good job of clear messaging,” Dr Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told NPR News. He added: “Control the virus and we can open up much more of the economy.”
Scientists and researchers are further hoping the end of a presidency known for fanning conspiracy theories, muzzling scientists and spreading misinformation will bring more Americans to a shared set of facts. In an analysis of news articles about the coronavirus, Trump fueled 38% of the misinformation claims, making him one of the largest sources in the world according to researchers at Cornell University. One of Trump’s central lines of attack was that public health researchers and Biden wanted another lockdown, comparing health policies to a “prison state”. Similarly, Trump’s allies tend to position economic and social health as in opposition, rather than complementary. Gonsalves described Trump’s strategy as “let the pandemic run its course and blame public health for the economic and social collapse [Trump] could have averted from the very beginning.” Spriggs said some of the pandemic’s most consequential questions lay ahead for the Biden-Harris administration. “This disease has been so disruptive, and the real questions we haven’t been pushing is what happens after,” he said. “If we emerge and the only thing standing are Amazon and Walmart what does that mean?”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
1965,Vote Leave's Lee Cain tipped as next Downing Street chief of staff,11/11/20,"One of Boris Johnson’s most loyal allies, Lee Cain is considering an offer to be Downing Street’s chief of staff, in a move that would consolidate the power of former Vote Leave officials around the prime minister. Cain’s appointment, which is not confirmed, will cause ructions in Westminster, including among special advisers and ministers who had been hoping for an outsider to be appointed to the key role. It is understood that Johnson offered Cain, currently director of communications, the position around a week ago, and the adviser has been considering whether he should accept. Friends indicated that Cain had been considering leaving Downing Street “once the government had got over the hump of Covid,” partly because of the relentless nature of the job, until Johnson had unexpectedly made his offer. In his current role, Cain has been increasingly centralising government communications in Downing Street and will oversee the new Downing Street spokeswoman, Allegra Stratton, who will be the face of Downing Street’s new daily televised press briefings. Cain is known to have been uneasy with the choice of Stratton for press secretary and he has also previously clashed with Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds. Other Whitehall sources said Cain’s appointment as chief of staff, first reported by the Times, was a long way from being certain. A number of government sources expressed surprise at the idea that Cain would be considered.
Cain – currently No 10’s director of communications – is a longtime adviser to Johnson, including during his time as foreign secretary and while on the backbenches after his resignation. The pair are particularly close, with Cain staying loyal to Johnson even when the former mayor of London’s star appeared to be faltering amongst Tories. A former tabloid journalist, Cain is close to the prime minister’s adviser Dominic Cummings from their time working on Vote Leave, and partly credited with bringing him into Downing Street. A new chief of staff is set to take over the day-to-day running of the Downing Street operation, currently overseen by Cummings, to allow him to step back and focus on key policy objectives, such as Whitehall reform. Should Cain accept role, Johnson’s inner circle would be Cain, Cummings, as well as Edward Lister, the chief strategic adviser and the cabinet secretary, Simon Case. Runners and riders who have been tipped for the role including Isaac Levido, the Australian protege of Tory elections guru Lynton Crosby, who ran the 2019 election campaign, Johnson’s foreign policy adviser John Bew, Paul Stephenson – another Vote Leave veteran – and Gabriel Milland, a former spad and close to Cummings who now runs the agency Public First. However, a number of those rumoured to be in demand for the role by No 10 run their own lucrative communications operations and would need some convincing to join government. Andrew Feldman, the former Tory party chairman, has reportedly turned down any overtures to persuade him to apply for the role. Cain caused a stir earlier in the year when political journalists boycotted a Downing Street briefing after he banned selected reporters from attending. The confrontation took place inside No 10 after Cain tried to exclude reporters from the Mirror, the i, HuffPost, PoliticsHome, the Independent and others from an official government briefing. Labour accused Johnson of deploying Donald Trump-like tactics to avoid scrutiny. Among those who refused the briefing on the UK’s trade negotiations with the EU were the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, ITV’s Robert Peston and political journalists from Sky News, the Daily Mail, the Telegraph, the Sun, the Financial Times and the Guardian. The briefing was due to be given by government officials, who are meant to be politically neutral, but did not happen because of the walkout.",,Politics,Guardian,5
1966,‘We’re in power now’: Evo Morales makes gleeful return to town he fled,11/11/20,"Tens of thousands of jubilant followers have welcomed Evo Morales back to the coca-growing region from which he fled into exile exactly one year ago after what they branded a racist rightwing coup. “Evo, Evo, Evo,” chanted the people who had travelled from all over Bolivia to witness their leader’s triumphant return home in the jungle-flanked town of Chimoré.
Bolivia’s first indigenous president resigned and abandoned the South American country on 11 November 2019, making his escape on a Mexican air force jet that whisked him out of Chimoré’s airport. Morales decided to bolt when security forces withdrew their support after later questioned claims of electoral fraud in the presidential election sparked street protests and deadly unrest. But on Wednesday, two days after re-entering Bolivia at the start of an emotional, politically charged homecoming, he made a gleeful return to the same town – to a rapturous reception. In a highly symbolic move, tens of thousands of followers from across the country had gathered on the runway from which Morales took flight.
Addressing them from a stage decked with green, yellow and red balloons, Morales declared: “We knew we were not alone. We knew we would return.” Wreathed in white flowers and coca leaves, the former coca growers union leader thanked the crowd for its support during his year-long banishment, railed against the US and mocked Jeanine Áñez, the conservative senator who took power after he was forced from office. Morales, 61, recalled how in January Áñez had urged the Bolivian people to stop “the savages” from regaining power. “The Bolivian right and the global right should know: the savages are back in government,” he added sarcastically. “We’re in power now.” Morales decision to return to Bolivia, just weeks after his party reclaimed the presidency in a rerun of last year’s election, has enraged opponents and unnerved some within his own party, the Movement for Socialism (Mas). Bolivia’s new leftwing president, Luis Arce, has distanced himself from his predecessor and has not taken part in Morales’s caravan to Chapare province. But Morales is still adored in many parts of the country for the social, economic and racial strides Bolivia made during his three terms in power. There have been scenes of joy this week as the exiled politician crossed Bolivia’s southern border with Argentina and headed north towards the jungle-covered Chapare region where he began his political career in the 1980s.
Before Morales spoke in Chimoré, Justina Choque, 37, had fought her way to the front of the throng. She beamed in anticipation under a wide-brimmed hat. “We will never forget our President Evo. He identifies our roots. He represents the poor, the peasants, and this story will never be forgotten. He will always be our undisputed leader,” said Choque, a coordinator for the Mas party in Cochabamba. “We have lived through massacres, with dead and wounded,” she said, recalling the shooting of unarmed civilians at the height of last year’s unrest. “But thanks to Luis Arce, we got back our country.” Nearby, a group held up a banner commemorating Roberth Calisaya, 20, who was killed last year when soldiers opened fire on demonstrators in Santa Cruz. “When [Evo] left, there was a dictatorship that persecuted our people,” said María Poma, whose sister was wounded in unrest. “They showed no mercy to my sister, in spite of her being a woman, and they beat and tortured her as if she was a man. “We want justice for all the victims. We want justice from that damn dictatorship we lived through,” said Mark Frauz, another family member. “It’s a joy for us that Evo has returned.” Along the road north Morales was serenaded by brass bands and mobbed by devotees shouting words of support or clutching the multicoloured indigenous Wiphala flag that Morales made one of Bolivia’s national standards. “The fight goes on,” the former cocalero activist proclaimed as his motorcade began its three-day journey back on Monday morning. On Tuesday the former union leader visited his childhood home in Orinoca wearing an Andean poncho. Addressing the rally in Chimoré on Wednesday, Juan Carlos Huarachi, the head of the Bolivian Workers’ Centre, urged Morales’s champions to celebrate the return of “comrade Evo” and the defeat of the right. “We did not surrender, carajo! We fought back … The people are responsible for this revolution,” Huarachi said. “Comrade Evo isn’t just a domestic leader. He’s a Latin American leader and he’s a world leader,” he added. “Thanks to him we have our dignity. Thanks to him, comrades, we have recovered our identity.”",,Foreign,Guardian,5
